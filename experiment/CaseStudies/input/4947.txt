     Impacts on the Well London programme itself       The CADBE programme designed and implemented by UEL was the starting point       for delivering the portfolio of community-led Well London projects in each       of the 20 intervention areas, the total population of which is around       35,000.
UEL researchers informed the design and delivery of the Well       London projects by researching and documenting starting levels of healthy       eating, healthy physical activities and mental wellbeing, and by ensuring       that interventions were attuned to the target communities' self-reported       and evolving needs.
The questionnaires used in the UEL CADBE-coordinated       evaluation showed wide-ranging benefits:            80% of respondents reported an improved understanding of mental         wellbeing       86% felt more positive       83% had been helped to increase physical activity       63% had been helped to gain access to healthy food       60% had been helped to make more healthy eating choices          The case studies and interviews conducted as part of this evaluation       identified further individual and community-level benefits, including       greater confidence and opportunities for social networking, enhanced       community cohesion and improved links to local officials and service       providers.
Other stakeholders (local councillors, police and public health       officials) cited improved health behaviours and improved relationships       between communities and official bodies [a].
Findings from the       baseline results of the trial facilitated understanding of how healthy       behaviour change is effected and helped improve the design of the Well       London Phase 2 programme [b].
Impacts on public policy via contributions to policy debate and         formulation       Both the Well London programme broadly, and the results of UEL's CADBE       component in particular, have informed discussion, debate and policy       formulation among parliamentary policy makers, the National Institute for       Clinical Excellence, Local Authorities, NHS commissioning organisations,       Royal Society of Public Health, Institute for Health Equity, the Greater       London Authority, and the National Endowment for Science Technology and       the Arts (NESTA).
These stakeholders' current interest in and use of       community engagement and development approaches is evident in various       initiatives including the Big Society and Localism which have advocated       community empowerment, and the Marmot Review on addressing health       inequalities through action on the social determinants of health.
Community engagement approaches &#8212; such as that developed by UEL for Well       London &#8212; appeal particularly because of their potential to reduce health       inequalities and facilitate the more efficient use and integration of       health and community resources.
Against the backdrop of this increasingly       intense political interest in the use of community engagement and       development, Well London has been cited by the City of Westminster Local       Government Improvement Unit as a case study of good practice in the new       Public Health environment [c] and in NESTA's report on       transforming Healthcare [d].
The CADBE programme specifically was also cited in a November 2011 House       of Lords debate on the Health and Social Care Bill as `an excellent         example of how to undertake a strategic needs assessment across health         and social care that is driven by local communities and brings together         commissioners, providers and the university sector to work alongside         those communities in making a real difference to health and well-being'       [e].
During the same debate, Well London more broadly was held up       as an exemplar of effective community engagement and development in       identifying and addressing needs across health and social care to improve       health and wellbeing.
The CADBE programme also formed the basis for Well London receiving the       highest level Royal Society of Public Health Award for Health Promotion in       2011.
Responding to the presentation of that award to the Well London       Partnership, Prof Sir Michael Marmot acknowledged that "empowering         individuals and communities, and giving people a voice is integral to         addressing health inequalities.
I am delighted the Partnership has         achieved well-deserved recognition for its work" [f].
The Marmot       Review Fair Society, Healthy Lives also emphasises the importance       of participatory decision-making to ensuring that local health service       delivery is able to effectively tackle social inequalities in health.
Marmot's recommendations to develop community capacity to enable and       promote healthy behaviours constitute a strong endorsement of the CADBE       approach.
Impacts on health service policy, commissioning and delivery       As well as contributing to policy discussion and formulation relating to       community engagement and wellbeing more broadly, the CADBE approach has       also informed the development of specific health service guidelines       affecting the provision of care across the UK.
A summary of the Well       London approach was presented via Renton's provision of expert testimony       at a November 2012 NICE review, convened to develop guidance on working       with local communities to prevent obesity.
The subsequent NICE Guidance,       which are used by the NHS, Local Authorities, employers, voluntary groups       and other organisations involved in delivering care or promoting       wellbeing, clearly endorses the approach taken by Well London [g].
The Well London CADBE approach has also influenced a shift amongst       London-based NHS and Local Authority commissioning bodies towards using       community development approaches to promote health and wellbeing, and       modifying environmental drivers of health behaviours.
This endorsement of       community engagement and development approaches is evident, for example,       in the fact that, in 2013, Well London received follow-on funding for       implementation of the CADBE approach in nine new neighbourhoods across 9       London Boroughs.
This will support the delivery of Well London to a       further 15,000 residents across London, with additional funding provided       by 9 PCTs (total &#163;500,000 over 2 years) [h].
Interest in and the utility of the CADBE approach to health service       providers has been further endorsed by the recent provision of funding by       the Francis Crick Institute (the UK Centre for Medical Research and       Innovation) for the UEL team to contribute community engagement and       development activities [i] delivered at the Institute.
These       included training in community interviewing delivered for 10 local       residents between February and July 2013 as part of the Institute's       development of its community Living Centre in Camden, set up to help       improve health and wellbeing in one of the most deprived parts of London [j].
