     By 2011 the Portuguese labour market was suffering from serious       structural problems and reform had become a pressing issue.
Employment       legislation was very generous towards workers in permanent positions, but       disadvantaged those entering the labour market for the first time or       seeking to change jobs.
The Portuguese regulatory framework reinforced       segmentation and inequality in the labour market, and attenuated firm       performance and the incentives for new or existing firms to expand their       workforces.
A labour market reform programme emerged as part of the wider economic       and financial adjustment programme agreed between Portugal and the troika       of the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, and the       European Central Bank.
Informed by the above research, Professor Pedro       Martins, as Secretary of State (2011-13), shaped, prepared and presented       these employments laws to Parliament, supported by his legal team, and       signed almost all the ordnances listed below.
The keystone labour reforms were a reformed labour code embodied in a       series of laws passed by the Portuguese Government and currently in force:            Law 53/2011, of 14 October, which reduces and harmonizes severance         pay;       Law 3/2012, of 10 January, which allows an extraordinary renewal of         fixed-term contracts;       Law 23/2012, of 25 June, which introduces a large number of changes to         the labour code, in areas such as individual dismissals, severance pay,         working time organization, overtime pay, short-time working schemes, and         collective agreements; and       Resolution of the Council of Ministers 90/2012, of 31 October, which         sets criteria for the extension of collective agreements; and a minimum         wage freeze.
These reforms reduced severance pay levels towards the European mean,       allowed for a longer maximum duration of fixed-term contracts, widened the       range of economic circumstances under which permanent workers can be       dismissed (Martins, 2009a), facilitated the adoption of short-time working       schemes, allowed for the greater involvement of works councils in       collective agreements and restricted the formerly widespread extension of       collective agreements to firms or workers not affiliated in employer       organisations or unions, respectively (Martins, 2009b).
The other vital component of this reform programme involved training and       hiring incentives.
Any period of structural adjustment and redirection       towards tradable sectors requires significant investments in skills,       particularly for the unemployed.
The research outlined above provided       compelling evidence that in Portugal private returns to education tend to       be particularly high and that skills generate important positive       spillovers (Martins and Pereira, 2004, and Martins and Jin, 2010).
Accordingly several ordnances, resolutions and other policies to promote a       new active labour market and complementary training policies were       launched:            Ordnance 45/2012, of 13 February, created the "Est&#237;mulo 2012" measure;       Resolution of the Council of Ministers 51-A/2012, of 31 October,         created the "Impulso Jovem" programme; Ordnance 207/2012, of 6 July,         created an incentive for the acceptance of job offers; Ordnance         225-A/2012, of 31 July, which initiated the "Passaporte Emprego"         traineeships; Ordnance 229/2012, of 3 August, provided a social security         reimbursement for the hiring of unemployed aged 30 or below;       Ordnance 3-A/2013, of 4 January, giving employers a social security         reimbursement when hiring unemployed workers aged 45 and above; and       the "Vida Ativa" measure, providing short-duration training modules to         specific groups of unemployed.
The amendments to the labour code included provisions applicable to all       private sector employees: 3.5 million individuals, from the fourth quarter       of 2012.
Some provisions apply only to those workers hired from the day       when the provision was in force, which correspond to approximately 75,000       individuals per month.
For instance, in the case of Law 53/2011, in force       since November 2011, will apply to up to 1.5 million individuals (as of       June 2013).
The active labour market policies apply potentially to all       registered unemployed: 810,000 individuals, as of June 2013.
In terms of       their actual impact, the "Est&#237;mulo 2012" active labour market policy       (ALMP) supported the hiring of over 15,000 unemployed, while the different       ALMPs included under the "Impulso jovem" ALMP programme supported the       hiring of over 20,000 unemployed (numbers as of February 2013).
The "Vida       Ativa" measure involved training provision to over 200,000 unemployed       during its first year of operation, since its inception in February 2012.
Following the reforms, Portugal moved to eighth place (in 2009 it was       first) out of 34 countries in terms of the strength of permanent       employees' protection (OECD Employment Outlook 2012); and unemployment       fell, from 17.7% to 15.6%, and GDP increased, by 1.3%, between the first       and third quarters of 2013.
