     `The European Commission in Question' has had impact on three       institutions.
First, the research       team was able - as outsiders - to ask questions that management could not       put to its own       employees and was granted unprecedented access within the organization.
It       delivered detailed       analysis of the backgrounds, beliefs and attitudes of staff to managers       and others in the European       Commission.
In the words of the Secretary General of the European       Commission, the findings of       the research `informed management thinking and fed into discussions         within the organization on         recruitment, career progression, reform and reform management.
On         attitudes to reform, including         appraisal (the CDR), financial management and the new role of the         Secretariat General, the project         produced data that contributed to [our] understanding of staff views and         feedback on the processes         concerned.'
Further, the `breakdowns by department, nationality,         gender and level of seniority .
.
.
provide[d] valuable new information to senior officeholders .
.
.
enabled managers in the         Commission to develop a more fine grain understanding of the views of         staff.'
(see below, 5.5) For       similar reasons, President Barroso commented in January 2010, following       presentations to senior       officeholders, that the project: `will help us make the Commission a         more efficient and effective         administration that better serves European citizens' (5.4 below).
Lunchtime presentations were       videoed for training purposes.
The results of the research were communicated by several means.
Kassim       and Peterson       presented provisional results to the Secretary General, members of the       President's cabinet and       senior officials from DG HR throughout 2009 and 2010.
Following completion       of the analyses,       Kassim made invited presentations to senior officeholders at the Directors       General weekly       meeting, 1 July 2010 (50 top managers, chaired by the Secretary General),       the Commission's       Lunchtime Seminar on 12 July 2011, attended by 40 officials, the European       Commission Careers       Network, 13 July 2011 (15 officials), senior management teams in DGs       MARKT, Secretariat       General European Personnel and Selection Office, COMP, JUST, TAXUD, EMPL,       INFSO (12 July       to 12 October 2011), as well as to Vice President &#352;ef&#269;ovi&#269;'s private       office (24 July 2012).
Kassim       also addressed the Commission's Senior Management Seminar, 13 September       2012, attended by       the Commission's top 400 managers and addressed by President Barroso, Vice       President       &#352;ef&#269;ovi&#269;, and Secretary-General of the Council.
According to the       Commission Secretary General:       `Slide presentations of provisional findings at regular intervals         throughout the project and an early         copy of the manuscript .
.
.
provide[d] important insights into the         backgrounds of staff, their         motivation for joining the Commission and career mobility'.
Impact was not limited to officeholders at the very top (see 5.8 below).
The Secretary General       writes that findings concerning `the characteristics and challenges of         each department in terms of         staff, motivation, perceptions and mobility/career patterns, as well as         the origins, composition and         outlook of the personnel in each department...
These findings have been         of particular use to         managers across the organization, especially since senior managers are         subject to rotation.
They         have found it helpful to have an analysis of the workforce in the         departments for which they have         taken recent charge.'
They also observed that: `the project has         been useful in challenging widely         accepted myths about the Commission and its staff'.
Second, analysis of the nationality and career profiles of Commission       officials contributed to FCO       reflections on how the UK can improve the recruitment of British nationals       to the European       administration at a time that the UK is severely underrepresented.
Kassim       delivered a presentation       at the FCO to an audience of 40 civil servants from across Whitehall.
The       FCO official from the       European Directorate who organized the visit, wrote afterwards (5.4,       below): `The event was         deemed to be a great success .
.
.
Your findings have since been         circulated widely throughout         government.
We received a lot of positive feedback on the event and on         the research that you         provided, including at Ministerial level.
I also wanted to let you know         that your research has had a         policy impact.
Your findings served to confirm or crystallise a number         of important points for us,         enhanced our understanding of the key issues, and the policy advice you         gave on the back of your         research has provided valuable food-for-thought.

[Y]our research         will feed into HMG's policy         analysis and formulation regarding how to take forward the recruitment         agenda over the next 6         months.'
Connolly and Kassim subsequently participated in a       `brainstorming' meeting with senior       FCO officials on the future of recruitment policy.
Third, at a critical juncture in Scotland's politics, when the Scottish       government increasingly needs       to engage with the European Commission, presentations on 4 November 2012,       made by Peterson       and Kassim in the External Affairs Division of the Scottish government,       attended by officials from 7       divisions, delivered findings designed to assist officials in better       engaging with the Commission.
A       questionnaire completed by attendees confirmed the value of session in       adding new knowledge       about the organization (see below, 5.7).
Impact among the wider EU policy community and the general public is       more difficult to measure,       but key findings were summarised in European Voice, 3 April 2012       (Economist publication; weekly       circulation 4,540 - see below 5.2), policy briefings circulated to a       policy mailing list, and the       dedicated website `The European Commission in Question'       (http://www.uea.ac.uk/politics-       international-media/european-commission-in-question/) which has recorded       more than 5,000 visits.
