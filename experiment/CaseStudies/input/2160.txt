     The research was designed to involve key stakeholders and interest groups       in an iterative process leading to the collaborative production of       relevant research outputs, and to maximise its impact.
The research was       selected by the AHRC as an `impact case study' to illustrate the wider       value of humanities research.
The AHRC report stated that the research "can         be used to demonstrate and communicate in a highly accessible way both         contemporary and historical land management issues to a diverse audience         of policymakers and other stakeholders" (p36) (IMP1).
Pathways to impact were incorporated in the work schedule for each       AHRC project:            During the research grant, two symposia were held for stakeholders and         the policy community.
The research conclusions were then presented at         stakeholder workshops held in 2009 and 2010 in each of the four case         study areas: at Eskdale (Cumbria), Rhayader (Powys), Titchwell (Norfolk)         and Ingleton (North Yorkshire).
During the Follow-on Funding Project the research impacts were widened         by incorporating the National Trust and the Foundation for Common Land         as project partners.
Two workshops were run jointly with the National         Trust.
The first (London, January 2013) considered different governance         models for engaging community interests in the management of common         land.
The second (Haslemere, April 2013) considered ways to improve the         governance of common land for wildlife and ecology.
The project         concluded with a national conference &#8212; "Sustaining the Commons" &#8212; on 5th         July 2013 in Newcastle.
These events facilitated the sharing of good practice in commons         management, and for adapting management to reflect different property         regimes.
They were attended by: DEFRA, Natural England and Natural         Resources Wales; the Foundation for Common Land; Scottish Crofters         Federation; Federation of Cumbria Commoners; Surrey County Council; the         Chilterns Partnership; the association of commons registration officers         and other local government organisations; NGOs (e.g.
the Open Spaces         Society, the Wildlife Trusts and the RSPB); and individual commoners and         commoners groups.
In a book entitled The Public Value of the Humanities, the       research has been described by Stephen Daniels (Director of the AHRC       Landscape and Environment Programme) and Ben Cowell (National Trust) as       having "helped reconstruct the collective memory of common land ... As         well as informing and improving the governance of commons the project         has enhanced wider scholarly understanding and public awareness"       (p112) (IMP2).
The research has generated both local and national impacts.
It       has been used by:     Stakeholders, community groups and public bodies in the 4 case study         areas      The project's work on property rights and on the continuing relevance of       customary management have informed the way in which management issues have       been considered and addressed in a modern context (IMP1-6).
In the       Eskdale case study, for example, the research analysed manorial byelaws       regulating land use on Eskdale common, Cumbria, dating from 1587 (the       "Eskdale Twenty Four Book").
Daniels and Cowell confirm that: "The         project has effectively reintroduced this text to the commoner community         as a whole, as part of the initiative to restore flexibility and local         custom in the governance of Eskdale Common, and to address the new         requirements of environmental law; a sustainable text for a sustainable         landscape" (p115) (IMP2).
The policy community, national stakeholder groups and NGOs     The research has had an important impact in altering the awareness of key       members of the public policy community.
It has also emphasised the need       for locally mediated solutions to self- management that take account of       property rights and the historical development of appropriators' rights       and duties (IMP1-8).
The Common Land Research website (http://commons.ncl.ac.uk/)       has been used by Natural England to inform management guidance to       stakeholders, e.g.
"The Contested Common Land project is developing         ideas for the long term sustainable management of commons...the amateur         with an interest in the history of the local common ... will [also] find         much there to inspire and guide research": Natural England, Exploring         our Common's Past (Commons Factsheet No.
02, Natural England, 2010).
Online via:       http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/115021.
The research was used by the Foundation for Common Land and Natural       England in the development of the "Commons Toolkit", which provides       guidance for stakeholders, landowners and commoners on commons management       (IMP7).
And it has been used by NGOs working to promote the       improved governance of commons in England and Wales.
For example, the       General Secretary of Open Spaces Society stated: "The project         demonstrated the importance of understanding the history of commons in         securing their future.....and the different ways of working on and         governing the commons in order to ensure their survival and the need for         respect and sensitivity...this is extremely beneficial to the [Open         Spaces] society and to our members in championing the commons" (IMP8).
One of the Trustees of the Foundation for Common Land (and former       Principal Project Manager for Common Land, Natural England) said: "The         Contested Common Land project has built up best practice and pooled it         for the benefit of wider communities" (IMP4).
The National Trust is using the research to improve the governance of its       common land estate in England and Wales, and to develop new governance       arrangements for increasing community involvement in commons management.
The research has helped the Trust to identify key issues that must be       addressed in order to deliver the Trust's policies for the sustainable       management and improvement of its common land estate, which encompasses       66,000 hectares of common land (11% of all common land in England and 13%       of common land in Wales).
The East of England Director of the Trust       confirmed that "The National Trust gets enormous insights on a wide         range of issues we deal with on a daily basis in managing our estate         from working with academic partners...and this project is a good example         of that in practice" (IMP3).
The research contributed to the Final Report of the Foresight Land Use       Futures research project: Land Use Futures: Making the Most of Land in         the 21 st Century (IMP9).
The       Joint Deputy Head of Foresight confirmed: "The evidence base for the         Foresight project final report provides the crucial scientific basis for         the findings, and [(2)] was a key component of that.
The         Foresight Report has been used to inform thinking across government         since its publication...and the importance of the Land Use Report and         its evidence base in informing policy is set to continue into the         foreseeable future" (IMP10).
