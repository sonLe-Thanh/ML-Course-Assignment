     The cutting edge approach to design and design methodology that was not       fully adopted by Aynsley became fully realised in Flux with resultant       impact on the non-academic users of the vanguard bone china tableware       designs produced by Flux.
The Flux Company Stoke-on-Trent Limited (http://fluxstokeontrent.com/)       was set up using money from the Higher Education Innovation Fund.
In 2010       Sanderson set up a small batch production/research unit in the       university's business village.
Partnerships were set up with the Co-       Creating Value Collective in Brussels and Duchess China Ltd,       Stoke-on-Trent, who manufacture Flux's designs.
When the first tableware       products were produced Sanderson launched Flux at the prestigious Maison       &amp; Objet trade fair, Paris, in January 2011 and secured &#163;40,000 worth       of orders (see: http://staffslive.co.uk/2011/10/21/new-stoke-on-trent-ceramics-firm-flux-launches-at-spode/).
On 26 March 2012 Flux Stoke-on-Trent won the `Ceramics and glassware       designer' category at the Home and Gardens Designer award.
In addition, it       caught the attention of numerous newspapers and magazines, including the Guardian       and Monocle.
Veranda and Elle Decoration have       featured Flux tableware and Flux was nominated for a tableware award in Elle         Decoration in 2011 (http://staffslive.co.uk/2011/10/20/success-for-staffordshire-university-ceramic-design-firm/).
To       date over &#163;100,000 of orders have been received for the cutting edge       designs produced by Flux.
Flux is sold via a broad spectrum of channels from online to the       prestigious BHV department store, 52 Rue de Rivoli Paris; Mint, an       interior design store in central London (2 North Terrace London SW3 2BA).
Flux also has also developed outlets in Switzerland and Russia (see:       https://www.staffs.ac.uk/assets/Flux%20Press%20Release%202_tcm44-61896.pdf)       Flux has been showcased in the British Embassy in Bern in 2013, and       ceramics trade fairs such as Tent, London (http://www.tentlondon.co.uk/node/1268);       Maison &amp; Objet, Paris; NY Now, New York.
Flux has also facilitated valuable opportunities for Staffordshire       University MA Ceramic Design students.
After working for Flux       Brazilian-born Neusa Basso, was approached by the Portuguese company Vista       Alegre to head a project for their company (see:       http://staffslive.co.uk/2011/10/21/new-stoke-on-trent-ceramics-firm-flux-launches-at-spode/).
Another MA Ceramic Design student Sarah Callard came to the attention of       two well-known French companies via Flux who offered her positions as a       designer (see:       http://www.staffs.ac.uk/news/ceramics-company-influxed-with-orders-tcm4235617.jsp).
