     Due to his significant contribution to the understanding of BMR across       populations, as shown above, Henry was invited to be a special scientific       advisor to the FAO/WHO/UNU Expert Consultation on Energy in Human       Nutrition, for which he produced a background document.
This development       formed the foundation on which later impacts were achieved in the period       of assessment:     In 2011 the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) reviewed       Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) for energy requirements in the UK, which       required a review of the means of calculating BMR.
Their report [a] was       one of the most comprehensive reviews of energy requirements.
It found       that the Henry equations showed a greater degree of accuracy in predicted       BMR compared with measured BMR than any other equation tested.
As a       result, the SACN recommended that the Henry equations should be adopted by       the UK and Europe for the estimation of energy requirements and the       associated food production requirements at the population level (see       paragraphs 192-3, [a]).
Until the publication of the Henry equations every       dietitian was using the Schofield equations.
Following the recommendations       by SACN the Henry equations have now replaced these equations and are the       ones recommended for use by dietitians in most clinical conditions.
Also in 2011, the British Dietetic Association's Parenteral and Enteral       Nutrition Group (PENG) produced the 4th edition of their A Pocket         Guide To Clinical Nutrition, in which the authors recommend the use       of the Oxford equations to estimate BMR rather than the Schofield       equations [b].
In September 2012, the Nutrition Support Interest Group of       Ireland (NSIG) advised the Irish and Nutrition Dietetic Institute (INDI)       to recommend the use of the Henry/Oxford equations rather than the       Schofield equations (or COMA update of these), to estimate BMR.
Most       dietitians have already changed over to using these equations [c].
Similarly, the 2013 updated print-run of the Oxford Handbook of         Nutrition and Dietetics [d] , which is a key resource for dietetics       practitioners and students, was updated to use the Henry equations for       estimated BMR, relating to issues of general nutritional Energy Balance,       nutrition for people with Cardiovascular disease, other illnesses and burn       injuries.
In January 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published       their report [e] defining DRVs for energy, which relies heavily on the use       of the Henry predictive equations for BMR (referred to as Resting Energy       Expenditure (REE) in this document).
The report notes that, in common with       the SACN findings, the Henry equations provide the best predictive values       for estimating energy requirements, giving a greater accuracy.
It was       recommended that the Henry equations be utilised to develop guideline DRVs       for energy in all demographic groups.
Moreover, the EFSA document will now       serve as a basis to estimate the energy requirements in the 27 countries       within the EU.
Dietetic and Nutritional consultants make daily use of predicted BMR in       their practice, and the widespread recommendation of the new Henry       equations for estimation in the above resources has therefore had an       impact on both them and their patients and clients.
The Henry equations       are, 	  "used to calculate an individual's basal metabolic rate, which         forms the basis of the calculation of energy requirements in         individuals, groups and populations.
This calculation is used to         prescribe diets in the treatment of many conditions including obesity,         malnutrition, gastroenterology and spinal cord injuries.
It is also used         when prescribing nutritional supplements, enteral and parenteral         nutrition for patients with a wide variety of conditions e.g.
burns,         stroke, cancer.
Therefore the Henry equations are an essential element         of everyday dietetic practice.
Dietitians working in other settings such         as schools and public health use them to form the basis of a lot of         their work e.g.
menu planning, interventions aimed at reducing the         prevalence of obesity."

The chief editor of the Manual of Dietetic Practice (5th         Ed) has also ensured that this publication also makes use of the       Henry equations as opposed to the Schofield equations [g].
By association, as the food and nutrition industry relies on scientific       evidence to support any claims on food items being `healthy' they are       required to test their products against recommended standards.
This       includes being able to show what proportion of the Recommended Daily       Allowance (RDA) of energy is contained within any product.
This means that       as the Henry equations are becoming integrated into national guidance via       the EFSA recommendations, they also underpin the claims against RDA of       food products produced and sold in those countries.
National and international bodies require a sound scientific basis in       planning for procuring food supplies, stockpile of food for emergencies       and as a tool for monitoring national food requirements.
It is essential       that there is a defined methodology that may be used for assessing the       above needs and that an accurate predictive equation is available to       estimate energy needs.
The recent uptake of the Henry equations by the       EFSA and SACN will have an effect on the on-going policy revisions       concerning issues such as these, as this one of the inherent purposes of       developing them.
