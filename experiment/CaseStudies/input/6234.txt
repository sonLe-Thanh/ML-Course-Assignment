     The SME research function in Barclays mainly works on projects that will       either increase income       from its customer base, or reduce the costs of serving clients.
The       research findings and       knowledge acquired from the collaborative research with the University of       Sussex have been       applied across a wide range of activities in conjunction with       contributions from other Barclays' staff,       so making it difficult to separate the Sussex contribution from these       other factors.
Nevertheless,       Barclays have estimated that, if the Sussex collaboration leads to a 1 per       cent improvement in       either measure (higher income or reduced costs), this implies a direct       annual value of between       &#163;6m and &#163;10m p.a.
The judgement of Frankish and Roberts is that       the direct benefits considerably       exceed &#163;6m-&#163;10m p.a.
but cannot be specifically identified for the       reasons noted above.
In       addition to this, Barclays estimate a saving of &#163;15m p.a.
from       ending the provision of free banking,       a development introduced in 2012 as a result of collaboration on the       Sussex research [see Section       5, C1, C2 and C3].
This impact is clear in four specific developments in Barclays:             More specific targeting and segmentation of customers         [based on the findings of R1, R2         and R5]       During the last three years, Barclays has moved to target start-ups and         to segment existing         customers based on both future survival prospects and their potential         use of business banking         products and services (where product use, especially, is often linked to         business growth).
For start-ups, the emphasis has moved to a greater focus on         incorporation, supported by links         with company-formation agents, an improved ability to process a high         volume of account         openings from a single source and better management of Barclays' wider         capacity in this         market.
As a result, the proportion of companies amongst start-ups has         risen from 56 per cent         in 2011 to 68 per cent in 2013.
This is expected to increase income from         start-ups by 7-8 per         cent over the next five years.
Among established customers there has been a move away from a generic         approach to         segmentation, based primarily upon location and backward-looking         measures of size, to one         combining medium-term potential with a focus on the attitudes and         relationships of owners to         their businesses.
Switchers [based on the findings of R1 and R5]       In the last two years, Barclays has revised its policy on providing         free banking for established         businesses moving banks.
Barclays no longer offers switchers a period of         12 or 18 months' free         banking, unlike most of its main competitors.
This strategic shift was a         direct consequence of         the improved understanding of business demographics and growth provided         by collaborative         research with the University of Sussex.
The savings from the ending of         the provision of free         banking are &#163;15m p.a.
[C1, C2 and C3].
The provision of training and advice seminars [based on         the findings of R2 and R5]       In the last two years, Barclays has shifted the focus of its seminar         programme partly as a direct         result of the work from the Sussex collaboration.
For over a decade,         short introductory seminars         were funded by Barclays and offered to people in the early stages of         going into business.
A shift         is currently underway to refocus this &#163;2m of spending a year towards         providing events for         established, rather than potential, customers.
The content of these         events has also been         adjusted [C1, C2 and C3].
Deprived areas and postcodes [based on the findings of         R3 and R4].
A key area of engagement between banks and government in 2013 is a         requirement that banks         publish disaggregated SME lending data by postcode sector.
Barclays'         ability to engage with         government in a detailed and timely manner was underpinned by the skills         developed, and the         wider insights to the postcode data gained, directly from the Sussex         University research on         SMEs in UK deprived areas.
Indeed, at the conclusion of the         negotiations, Barclays' CEO         received a letter from the Chancellor of the Exchequer praising the role         of the company in         `leading the industry' on this work, suggesting strongly that other         banks were much-less-well         prepared [C4].
The impacts of Barclays-Sussex collaborative research on Barclays Bank       are reflected in policy       changes towards SMEs (that have improved service to SMEs and the Bank's       profitability), and the       Bank's ability and readiness to meet government requirements for data.
These demonstrate the       two-way commitment and trust between a high-profile commercial       organisation and the University       of Sussex's academic researchers.
The commitment of Barclays' employees,       Frankish and       Roberts, to obtaining the best possible understanding of their SMEs'       customer base and their       combined more-than-40-years of service with Barclays makes their       recommendations for policy       change highly influential within the bank.
