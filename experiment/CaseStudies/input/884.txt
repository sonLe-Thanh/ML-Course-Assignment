     The research projects led by Gooday and Radick in       collaboration with research students and postdoctoral fellows have allowed       UK museums and science institutions to develop a deeper understanding of       IP and its critical bearing on learning resources and on building       institutional legacies.
The research has had a sustainable impact across       two major areas of collaboration: first through Gooday's       leadership on projects with the Thackray Medical Museum in Leeds and the       Museum of the History of Science at the University of Oxford, which have       helped motivate shifts in historical understanding and generated novel       engagement with schools; and second, through Radick's research and       regular consultation with the NIAB at joint supervisions of their Leeds       CDA students, which have helped re-position the NIAB archive as a       significant resource.
Museums and Archives     The above perspectives on patenting were brought to bear on ca.
1900       electrical medical technologies and the question of how to display these       so as to engage 21st Century audiences.
The Thackray Medical Museum       (Leeds) has welcomed input on the multiple meanings of patents for its       displays.
A one-year AHRC Knowledge Transfer Fellowship for a follow-up       project on re- interpreting the history of medical patents generated       outcomes that included revised interpretation of patented artefacts in       Thackray museum collections and a range of online materials (A);       articles for general medical audiences in the BMJ (B) and       general science audiences in the New Scientist (C); and       training workshops for six Thackray staff on 20th and 31st       January 2012 (corroboration in E).
The Thackray's Assistant       Curator noted how "the staff training was an opportunity to challenge         preconceptions around medical patents, the outcome of which was a more         diverse range of interpretation methods and enabled museum staff to look         at a collection differently, the outcome of which is inevitably a more         diverse range of interpretation methods."
(D) In a       post-project interview, the Joint CEO at the Thackray reported that the       project "was the first time the museum had worked in this way with         academic partners, but that this had proved so successful that she had         included the model in funding applications made since."
(E)     Gooday's research on communications technologies have also emerged       as especially instructive for clarifying ca.
1900 IP relationships,       narrowly and broadly construed, providing the framework, for example, for       the interview with Elizabeth Bruton (a PhD student on Gooday's       AHRC-funded CDA project with BT Archives) on Marconi and patents in the       BBC television series, The Story of Electricity (2011) and The         Genius of Invention (2013) (F).
Bruton is now a Leeds       postdoctoral researcher on an AHRC-funded Follow-on collaboration with the       Museum of the History of Science at the University of Oxford on       `Innovation in Combat', exploring IP issues in First World War       telecommunications.
In collaboration with Leeds teachers, she has       developed a schools pack from Gooday's research on the patented       Fullerphone of 1916 that offers pupils a fresh approach to interpreting       WWI by focusing on inventions, especially in telecommunications, rather       than on weapons.
The lead collaborative partner at Oxford anticipates that       this project will provide the Museum with "an opportunity for novel         schools engagement, and the creation and delivery of new resources".
A project workshop on 28 June 2013 engaged 40+ museums and archives staff       from across the UK with these results and collected evidence of impact       achieved.

National Institute of Agricultural Botany     A seminar for NIAB staff in 2009 by Radick and AHRC project       student Charnley led to further collaborations, with the aim of using Radick's       IP-and-genetics research as a framework for putting NIAB's history on a       firmer scholarly footing.
The research was also effective in redefining       that history, within NIAB and more widely, as a vital resource for       thinking through pressing questions about private/public relations in the       sciences today.
In her letter of support for the most recent AHRC CDA       application with NIAB, its CEO noted (10 November 2011) that the       partnership with Leeds had identified key issues that enhanced the       understanding of NIAB's historical foundation.
The IP-narrow/-broad       distinction has been central to revealing how NIAB's past is relevant to       its present, notably in energizing research on the difficulties       surrounding its foundation as servant of both the British state and       commercial plant breeders.
Stressing that the challenges of funding the       NIAB's applied, translational work have never gone away, the CEO reported       that "exploring that early rationale is helping us to position NIAB         firmly at the interface between basic plant science and application,         providing a pathway to impact for research."
The strategic       importance of the work of the Leeds researchers in the run-up to NIAB's       centenary plans, in 2019, was further underscored, especially with regard       to facilitating understanding of how NIAB has adapted to major changes       affecting the ecosystem in which it operates.
In expanding its work with       Leeds, it was noted, NIAB will be better able to make use of its history "to         strengthen and guide our strategy, developing key messages about our         ability to adapt and respond, and positioning us to take advantage of         development opportunities."
(I)     Taking forward this collaborative project, NIAB and Radick have       worked together to secure three CDA awards, funding research on the       Institute's value as a knowledge-making site over three periods: from its       founding in 1919 to 1969; from 1969 to the present; and in the present       day.
The project student on the first CDA, Dominic Berry, has not only       organized NIAB's archive (J) but has presented his research at the       NIAB Founders Day (10 Feb. 2012) and other on-site events.
As a result of       these activities (informed by Radick's IP-narrow/-broad       framework), key aspects of NIAB's past have been made newly accessible and       relevant to staff there.
In praising the transformation of NIAB's archive       into "a much-valued resource," NIAB's Communications Manager       expressed particular appreciation for the way that the Leeds team's work       has revealed how far "NIAB's original aims and objectives in         supporting the development of improved crop varieties and seeds to         safeguard food supplies are as relevant today in terms of addressing         food security as they were in 1919."
