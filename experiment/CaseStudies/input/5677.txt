     Nudge based strategies are an important and proliferating feature of       policy agendas, nationally and internationally, across diverse policy       areas, notably, environment, health and finance.
Our research has       supported both the appropriate use of such strategies and a critical       awareness among policy makers of the dilemmas involved in such       interventions.
For example, Sue Goss, Principal of the Office for Public       Management acknowledges `the impact that Gerry's research Nudge, Nudge,         Think, Think has had on the work that OPM has published on behaviour         change' noting `his research into the best ways to persuade the         public to change thinking and actions has been invaluable' [5.1].
After his most recent appearance on the Today programme (3 May       2013) where Stoker used this research to raise concerns about how future       development of Nudge strategies would have to recognise the need to       combine with other approaches and tackle ethical concerns about       interventions, he was invited to meet with Owain Service, Deputy Director       of the Behavioural Insights Team (UK Cabinet Office) to discuss how the       BIT should best meet these challenges [5.2].
The 2009 Political Quarterly article `Nudge, Nudge, Think, Think'       was immediately picked up by the Chief Executive of the RSA, Matthew       Taylor, who referred to it on his blog as a "brilliant paper".
The monthly       statistics for Taylor's blog are 13,000 views and 3,698 hits.
The blog is       widely influential with governments, think tanks and consultancies [5.3].
The importance of the research was recognised by the then Minister for       Decentralisation, Greg Clark, who chose to make his first public speech on       the Big Society at the launch of the final report of research findings for       the Rediscovering the Civic project on 23 June 2010.
In the       accompanying press release he praised the research for "[showing] that         citizens together can create the Big Society" [5.4].
In a       subsequent letter to Stoker (dated 1 July 2010), the Minister added: "I         have taken away with me clear views... in particular about what we         should be doing differently here at the Centre in order to generate the         trust and support we need to deliver the Big Society.
It has given me         even greater appetite to understand more about the behaviour and         motivations of our citizens...
I look forward to a continuing dialogue         with you all as we develop and realise our vision for the Big Society"       [5.5].
Clark then wrote the foreword to Nudge, Nudge, Think,         Think (2011), describing the book as "both timely and welcome" (5.6).
(The book itself has been downloaded over 5000 times by the end of 2012.)
The dialogue between Clark and Stoker continued in 2012 as they shared a       platform at the British Academy discussing the connection between localism       and Nudge [5.7].
Stoker has taken the work out to senior policy makers in Australia and       New Zealand, through the Australian and New Zealand School of Government       (ANZSOG), where behaviour change policy has become a feature of state       level government in New South Wales and Victoria.
Monica Pfeiffer,       Director Applied Learning at ANZSOG comments: `Gerry's presentations         and publications resulted in a better understanding of the relative         merits of different approaches to behaviour change so that governments         are more confident about what is worth doing and how; and equally         significantly what not to do' [5.8].
Notably Helen Wyn, the       Director of the Policy Advisory Group of the Department of Prime Minister       and Cabinet in New Zealand (after a presentation by Stoker in Wellington,       on 13 September 2012) commented that the Nudge, Nudge, Think, Think       book was valuable because it took a critical and empirical stance to the       new ideas of behavioural change.
She describes the work `as poking a         stick at it, asking questions about what is really going to work'.
She praises in particular the innovative introduction of the `useful       concept of think' alongside the established work on nudge and concludes: `your         work helps to raise awareness about applications and their limitations'       [5.9].
Media interest in the research has increased public awareness of civic       behaviour as well as related concepts such as the Big Society.
Stoker was       interviewed, for example, about Nudge by Radio 4's Today programme       on 23 August 2010, 8 June 2011 and 3 May 2013.
He also participated in a       BBC South documentary, broadcast in Autumn 2011, about the prospects for       the Big Society.
In addition, Stoker and Smith have made numerous       presentations of the research to practitioner audiences and the take up of       the work by consultancies has increased its impact at an operational level       [5.10].
