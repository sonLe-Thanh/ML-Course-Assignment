     The contribution of this piece of research had a significant       international impact in that it contributed to the discourse in Higher       Education and NGOs on the process of globalisation and the study of       international development across a global audience &#8212; with sales of the       initial book in India, Africa, the Australasia, Europe and the USA,       followed by translations of and publicity for the revised and updated       versions tailored for audiences in Eastern and Southern Europe.
The       impact, underpinned by excellent research, has been widespread and       pervasive in regards to the promotion of the discipline of International       Development Studies.
The research has brought the issues pertinent to development onto a       broader stage and has given it international recognition.
The Centre for       Global Education and the Knowledge Makes Change projects came to utilise       the publications as the benchmark in the field.
This had an impact not       only at international university departmental level, but also across the       development NGO sector.
The outworking of the initiative also led to       Gerard McCann being commissioned to work as an adviser on the English       language version of the guidelines for members of the Polish Parliament       and Senators going into the Polish Presidency of the European Union       Council in July 2011.
The European Union's Development Cooperation         Policy (Polish Language author Pawel Baginski, Global Development       Research Group; Warsaw, 2011, ISBN 978-83-929513-8-4, pp.1-218) was       circulated to all those working with the Council and European Parliament       committees on international cooperation.
The contribution also led to a       broader exploration of key themes and debates in the field of       international development opening up discourse in universities working       with the material and the books.
In April 2013, at St Mary's, some of the       participants collaborated to bring together representatives of the African       Diaspora in Ireland and African NGOs to conclude a consensus document on       `Peace in Africa' which was presented to the G8 Summit       (http://www.smucb.ac.uk/infoserv/news/?ArticleID=29821119175557&amp;S=1&amp;nq=1).
The impact was multiple.
The research made a distinct contribution to       impact by helping to bring together diverse interests working in the area       of international development and development education.
This ensured a       praxical linkage between academics working in the central areas of       North-South economic, political and social interaction, development       practitioners working in the field of development or within development       NGOs and political decision makers needing information on key areas       relevant to North-South cooperation strategies.
This research further       helped to generate dialogue.
The series of initiatives also assisted in the enhancement of development       studies departments in various countries.
In the University of Zambia the       English language version was used as a textbook for students of       development training going into the career of NGO management.
In Trnava       University the Slovakian version and the links were utilised to justify       the establishment of a distinct Development Studies department.
In Warsaw,       PAH adapted the research to inform policy makers of the importance of       practical intervention in cooperation strategies.
In Northern Ireland the       original research is used as a textbook on modules in Queen's University       Belfast, the University of Ulster and St Mary's University College       Belfast.
All the lecturers concerned have contributed to the text and work       together to develop the themes.
The lecture tours, promoting the research       in different languages, have covered six countries and sixteen       universities in total.
These were:            St Mary's University College Belfast, UK       Limerick University, Republic of Ireland       Cork University, Republic of Ireland       Warsaw School of Economics, Poland       Bratislava Economics University, Slovakia       Copernicus University, Poland       Torun University, Poland       Poznan School of Economics, Poland       Trnava University, Slovakia       Nitra University, Slovakia       University of Banska, Slovakia       Comenius University, Slovakia       European University, Cyprus       Cyprus University, Cyprus       Nicosia University, Cyprus       University of Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia          The outworking of the research initiative has been outstanding in terms       of the objectives of the original project, which were regional, in that       the adaptation and proliferation of the constituent ideas of the project       have gone global.
The significance of the research and the difference it has made to the       beneficiaries can be seen from            The extent to which the research has been picked up and used on a         global plane.
The way in which it has contributed to and consolidated the discourse         around international development studies.
The manner in which the research is accepted within the field as of         global significance and the research of choice by development studies         departments in a number of countries.
The way in which issues were profiled in an assertive manner with         reference to the interface between academic reflection and development         practice &#8212; this has informed the study of the issues covered in the         initial research.
The manner in which the authors and editors were permitted to take on         roles as advisors in their respective fields to strategies and policies         relevant to international development.
The extent to which the discourse implicit to the research has been         brought to different audiences on a global plane.
