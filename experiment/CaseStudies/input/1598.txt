     a) Heat acclimation     Dr Sunderland's research has changed international protocols and       practices and so improved the       performance of a wide range of sportsmen and women ranging from       international hockey players       and elite athletes to school teams and individuals engaged in charity       events.
Throughout the REF period, GB Hockey have used Dr Sunderland's       acclimation process and       sought her advice in preparation for all tournaments in hot environments       including the 2008 Beijing       Olympic Games.
The Head Coach of the British Squad, has commented "We         have chosen to use         Nottingham Trent for our acclimatisation training because of Dr         Sunderland's expertise coupled         with the unparalleled facilities...such preparation can mean the         difference between winning and         losing.
We are pleased to be working with a university that offers us         the very best personnel and         state-of-the-art technology...Dr Sunderland is the leading authority on         how to prepare hockey         players for hot climates."
Members of the England and Wales Hockey squads also came to NTU to be       acclimatised by Dr       Sunderland prior to the Commonwealth Games in Delhi in 2010.
Throughout the REF period, others visiting NTU to acclimatise and/or       experience exercise in the       heat include athletes preparing for the Marathon des Sables and marathon       runners preparing to       race in hot environments.
As the Director of Racekit UK acknowledges, "Since         becoming aware of         Dr Sunderland's research and expertise I have changed not only the way I         prepare as an athlete to         perform in hot climates, but also the way I prepare my clients to do the         same.
Dr Sunderland's         acclimation sessions at Nottingham Trent University have become a vital         part of our preparation for         the Marathon des Sables"     Prior to the Netball World Championships (2011) international netball       players visited NTU to       experience Dr Sunderland's acclimation process.
As have a School hockey       team preparing to go to       Malaysia and a number of individuals preparing for charity runs and walks.
Australian sports scientists have adapted Dr Sunderland's research,       introducing an intermittent       acclimation protocol to the Australian cricket team.
The Scottish Institute of Sport first approached Dr Sunderland for advice       about how best to       acclimate their players ahead of the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games, and       have continued to       seek her advice since then.
This has resulted in elite hockey and cricket       players and athletes,       adopting her new protocol and improving their performance.
It also       resulted in The Scottish       Institute of Sport and GB hockey adopting the protocol and inviting Dr       Sunderland to share her       experience and expertise (by) working as their Heat Acclimation       Consultant.
b) Neck cooling     Because Dr Sunderland was the first to demonstrate that neck cooling       improves performance.
Her       work attracted both research and media attention worldwide.
The Field       Hockey Coach at Indiana       University highlights the value and impact of her work thus, "Our         pre-season is exceptionally hot.
By following Dr Sunderland's very specific recommendations regarding         neck cooling and the timing         of technique/skill and acclimation sessions, we were able to safely and         efficiently make the         greatest performance gains ever for the coming season."
Articles have appeared in The New York Times (http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/29/lessons-from-exercising-in-the-heat/), SHAPE       magazine and Women's Health magazines, bringing the       benefits of neck cooling to the recreational audience.
c) Improving hockey performance     Dr Sunderland's research changed and continues to influence the       performance of international       hockey players and umpires during competitions in hot climates (e.g.,       Beijing Olympics 2008).
The       maintenance of hydration status (euhydration rather than hypo- or       hyperhydration) is imperative to       both physical and skill performance improvement and therefore success.
As       a result of her work,       the monitoring and prescription of fluid specifically during tournaments       in hot conditions is now       integral at major competitions.
The Head Coach Wales Hockey stated, "Dr         Caroline Sunderland         provided us with highly effective strategies for training, recovery and         nutrition for playing at the         Delhi Commonwealth Games.
These strategies were essential for         maintaining our performance         throughout the tournament in such heat.'
Having been commissioned to assess the activity profile and therefore       physical demands of       hockey umpiring by England Hockey and by the International Hockey       Federation (FIH), Dr       Sunderland's research led to the SHAPE research group producing a training       manual in 2010,       which is now used by international umpires from around the World.
The       Officials Manager, The       International Hockey Federation, confirms, "The research undertaken by         Dr Caroline Sunderland         and her team at Nottingham Trent University into the distances, types         and intensities of running         that International Umpires perform in individual matches and at         Tournaments, led to the creation of         the first ever fitness training programme for Umpires.
This was drawn up         in December 2010 in the       form of an International Umpire Fitness Training Manual.
It is now         provided to all International         Umpires and is available on the FIH website for all Umpires' use, not         just those who perform at         elite level... the fitness training programme is a vital component of         the standard preparations for         Umpires in the run up to their appointments to major FIH World level         Tournaments and multi-sports         events such as the Olympic Games."
To summarise, Dr Sunderland's research has improved exercise performance       in the heat for both       elite and recreational athletes across a range of sports.
The Head Coach       Wales Hockey reflects       the value of her work when she states, "Dr Caroline Sunderland's         research has had significant         impact across many sports but particularly in elite international         hockey.
She is the world's leading         authority on acclimation for team sports."
