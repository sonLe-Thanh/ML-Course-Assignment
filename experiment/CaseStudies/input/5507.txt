     In recent years, few disciplines have captured the public imagination       more than Local History.
Leicester's Centre for English Local History has been at the forefront of       this development,       pioneering imaginative approaches to the communication of the subject,       both through its academic       publications and outreach activities (e.g.
: digital `Town Trails' in       partnership with local authority       services and a multi-media production company (Ai-iii), and the       establishment, in 2013, in       collaboration with the Victoria County History, of the community-centred,       HLF-funded Charnwood         Roots research project (Aiv).
Emblematic of the Centre's success in raising the profile of Local       History is Michael Wood's       popular six-part BBC documentary The Story of England (2010) which       looked at 2,000 years of       British history through the prism of the Leicestershire village of       Kibworth using many of the       methods developed during ELH's Whittlewood Project.
The choice of       location followed C. Howell's       influential 1983 book on Kibworth's medieval and early modern history,       which originated as a PhD       thesis undertaken at ELH.
The first show attracted an initial TV audience       of 438,000 and       conservative estimates of viewing figures for each episode following       global distribution and digital       downloads are well in excess of 2 million; the book of the series sold out       its hardback print run and       reprint of 35,000.
The Story of England series led directly to       another &#8212; The Great British Story &#8212; A         People's History (BBC2 in 2012, with viewing figures of 1-2 million       per episode) &#8212; which was tied       directly to an HLF small grant programme, `All Our Stories' which funded       local heritage projects       nationwide, many using archaeological and local history methods showcased       at Leicester.
Reflecting on the experience, Wood (Bi-ii).
paid particular tribute       to Leicester's outstanding       contribution to the study of Local History, which he said had "influenced         the writing of history in         Britain and much further afield".
He added that it has been: "the         inspiration behind a lot of my 100         or so films".
Wood's comments on the seminal impact of the       "Leicester Approach" to the       popularization of Local History are echoed by Penelope Lively, who has       observed that: `Today,         television programmes on the landscape and its past are ubiquitous, but         Hoskins was the pioneer.
He did a series of his own, back in the 70s, a magisterial figure by         then, presiding over local history         and landscape history studies from his professorial chair at Leicester         University' (Biii).
Central to the Leicester Approach to Local History is the recognition       that macro processes are       best studied in micro contexts and that knowledge should be taken out of       the academy and into       communities.
As a direct consequence of this, Leicester historians lead       the way in turning       hundreds of members of the public of all ages and socio-economic       backgrounds into enthusiastic       local history researchers.
This is highlighted by two specific examples       outlined below.
Jones' Digging the Peculiar (DtP) is an interdisciplinary       fieldwork programme (2011-present)       centred on Southwell, Nottinghamshire.
It deploys archaeological and       historical research methods       to investigate fundamental problems about the chronology and creation of       towns and villages in       England.
The local community has been involved in all its activities       including excavation,       geophysical survey, earthwork survey, building survey and       palaeoenvironmental sampling.
As a       result of training received, Southwell Community Archaeology Group is now       using the excavation       and recording techniques learnt on the DtP programme to conduct       independent research into the       historical development of their town.
Their activities have fed back into       DtP projects, research       design and results.
Encouraged by their involvement in the DtP       programme, in 2012 the Group       successfully applied for a small grant from a Heritage Lottery Fund scheme       `All Our Stories',       deploying the survey techniques to investigate research questions of their       own (Ci-ii).
In nearby Norwell, the Heritage Group is to produce new booklets on the       early history of the       village using findings from DtP fieldwork in 2013, including       artefacts found by local people in village       gardens.
The secretary of the Group noted: "For the inhabitants of this         village this project has         provided, and will continue to provide, an entirely new perspective of         their own environment.
It has         enabled an appreciation of links with the past ...In summary, a most         positive experience both         socially and archaeologically."
(Ciii).
The DtP project has also involved local schools.
For example,       more than 50 Year 8-11 students       from the Nottingham Samworth Academy worked on the site in June 2013.
The       Vice Principal said       that the experience was particularly valuable because, `it allows our         students to engage in activities         which enrich and extend the curriculum, showing them how their familiar         subjects combine in the         world outside school'.
It provided `unique educational experiences ...         to broaden the often limited         social and cultural experiences many of our pupils have had to date'       (Civ).
The role of local communities as `co-producers' of local historical       knowledge is illustrated by       Hyde's projects developed with Leicester's diverse migrant       communities, in partnership with local       government agencies and national funding bodies.
Leicestershire County       Council have noted `the         immense value' of EMOHA's outreach programme, enabling very many       local history projects to       use oral history techniques to capture local historical knowledge (Di).
In 2012-13 the HLF East       Midlands funded 147 local history projects, 58% using Oral History methods       and all these were       referred to EMOHA as a condition of funding; HLF consider EMOHA `a         powerful community         engagement tool' (Dii).
Since 2008 EMOHA has provided 115       training sessions attended by 1079       people.
Community participation of this sort underpinned Migration         Stories.
Hyde trained       volunteers drawn from communities in Leicestershire, Derbyshire,       Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire       and Nottinghamshire to use domestic camcorders and laptops to create their       own videos, which       were made available to the community via the project website (Diii).
Legacy of Partition (2008-9)       also involved extensive meetings with community groups in Leicester and       Leicestershire, leading       the way to the creation of a permanent oral history archive, with a       digital exhibition, curating       memories of the 1947 Partition of India.
This archive is one of the first       to curate oral testimonies of       this historical phenomenon, `such information is rare and hard to find'       and `these high quality         materials [are of] not only local but national and international         significance' (Div).
What is more, the       testimonies collected as part of the project opened up a dialogue between       Leicestershire's diverse       South Asian migrant communities about their troubled past, thereby `contributing         to feelings of         inclusion and common humanity and shared citizenship'.
The impact of       the project was particularly       felt in local schools.
The Deputy Director of Inclusion at Rushey Mead       School, Leicester, noted:       `The resources allowed the pupils to...interpret this event afresh as a         period of history from which         lessons can and must be learned rather than vendettas and scores         settled' (Dv).
Legacy of         Partition was cited as a case-study of good practice on       inter-generational learning in a National         Institute of Adult Continuing Education (NIACE) report to Government       (Dvi).
With these and many other projects, Leicester historians are proving to       local communities that       history is not remote, theoretical and academic, but local and relevant.
History borrows       everybody's shoes, and Leicester leads the way in helping local       communities discover how their       own footprints add to the continuing story.
