     Recent years have witnessed a resurgence of public interest in common       land, often (erroneously) thought to be land belonging to everyone, at a       time when the environmental value of traditional forms of land use is       increasingly appreciated.
The department's work on common land has       contributed to the growing public interest in commons by placing modern       perceptions in historical context.
Its significance and reach are       indicated by the AHRC's decision to select the Contested Common Land       project as one of four impact case studies from research grants made under       the Landscape &amp; Environment Programme and to use it to illustrate the       wider value of humanities research.
Writing in The Public Value of the         Humanities (ed.
Jonathan Bate, 2011), Stephen Daniels and Ben Cowell       described the research as having `helped reconstruct the collective memory       of common land ... As well as informing and improving the governance of       commons the project has enhanced wider scholarly understanding and public       awareness' (source 1).
As this suggests, the research has had       impact in two main areas: i) enhancing public awareness; ii)       informing contemporary debates on the governance of commons.
i).
Enhancing public awareness of the culture of common land in         England and Wales.
This impact has been achieved in the following       ways:             The Harvest of the Hills, nominated by readers of The           Guardian (30 July 2005) as a `great classic of British nature         writing', has served as an awareness-raising study, highlighting the         distinctive hill farming culture of northern England, as can be seen         from its citations in websites as diverse as those of Cross Fell         Commoners' Association, Moniaive Community Action Project, the Cumbria         Hill Farming website, Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority's `Out of         Oblivion' pages and English Heritage's `Introductions to Heritage         Assets' pages.
The Contested Common Land project website (http://commons.ncl.ac.uk/)         has become a valued national resource in its own right, praised by         Natural England: `the amateur with an interest in the history of the         local common ... will find much there to inspire and guide research' (source           2).
Talks to local history and archaeological societies since 2008, namely         Eskdale Local History Society, Ingleborough Archaeology Group, Middleham         &amp; Dales Local History Group, Caldbeck Local History Society         (audiences of c.30 at each), Upper Wharfedale Field Society (80) and         Hexham Local History Society (70), and to larger audiences of interested         public and other stakeholders at study days organised by the Centre for         North West Regional Studies (Lancaster, February 2009; attendance 82)         and Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority (Grassington, April 2010;         attendance c.180), have reached a total audience of over 500 (source           3).
These meetings were used to impart knowledge and share         experience concerning traditional land-use systems, thereby further         raising awareness of past and present practices.
In the Chilterns, Frances Kerner, a doctoral student, worked with the         Chiltern Conservation Board in 2012-13 to engage Year 4 primary school         children in studying the past and future of common land in West Wycombe,         Bucks.

As part of the Building Commons Knowledge project in 2012-13, the       department devised a dedicated online `toolkit' and ran a series of       workshops across England and Wales for commoners and other members of the       public, designed to encourage grassroots research into the history of       commons, particularly by capturing communal memory and oral testimony       throughout the 20th century.
The resulting `Commons Stories', the fruits       of this community-generated knowledge, are posted on the project website (http://commons.ncl.ac.uk/?page_id=597).
Local activity in capturing `Commons Stories' has fostered community       cohesion by involving different elements of the community in reclaiming a       sense of communal `ownership' of common land.
Pat Garside, chair of the       local history society at Bampton, Cumbria, confirmed that the `formulation       of the ... project and the provision of the 'toolkit' meant that farmers,       commoners and local historians could collaborate in a structured way ...       and together produce a greater understanding of the issues involved in the       use and management of common land.
... the Commons project has established       and reinforced social links in a very positive way'.
(sources 5 and       6)     The cumulative impact of all these activities has raised the public       awareness of the culture of common land in England and Wales, its       environmental value, and its importance in the cultural heritage,       particularly in the uplands.
ii) Stakeholder engagement, informing debates surrounding the 		governance of common land today.
By stressing local diversity in the       history of management systems, the research has highlighted the relevance       of past experience when devising current and future management strategies.
The Contested Common Land project not only informed the public of the       living heritage of traditional hill farming culture but demonstrated to       stakeholders its continuing relevance in managing common land.
For       example, the research analysed a set of byelaws from Eskdale, Cumbria,       dating from 1587, which continued to govern the use of the common until       the late 20th century.
Even after the Commons Registration Act 1965, one       of the first decisions of the newly- founded Eskdale Commoners'       Association was to obtain a copy of the 1587 byelaws.
As Daniels and       Cowell commented, `The project has effectively reintroduced this text to       the commoner community as a whole, as part of the initiative to restore       flexibility and local custom in the governance of Eskdale Common, and to       address the new requirements of environmental law; a sustainable text for       a sustainable landscape' (source 1).
This impact has been achieved through the following channels:            Two symposia held in Lancaster and Newcastle, bringing together         academics, policy makers and practitioners with c.20 invited         participants at each, including representatives of DEFRA, Natural         England, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Crofting Federation,         Association of Commons Registration Officers, and Federation of Cumbrian         Commoners.
Commenting on the symposia, Gwyn Jones of the European Forum         on Nature Conservation &amp; Pastoralism noted that `socio-economic and         policy discussions are rather emasculated without a strong feel for the         history of land management', while Graham Bathe of Natural England         described the Lancaster symposium as `a highly stimulating event ...         particularly inspiring that old and ancient systems can have lessons for         us today'.
(sources 7 and 8)       Four stakeholder workshops, attracting over 100 people in total, held         in each of the four `Contested Common Land' case study areas.
These         allowed direct engagement with local stakeholders, including commoners,         land managers, government agencies and voluntary organisations.
The value of the research to external users has been demonstrated by the       approach made by the Foundation for Common Land (the national body       representing commoners' associations in England and Wales) to the       department to assist in furthering its strategic objectives, including in       particular: a) increasing information exchange and discussion       between commoners in different parts of England and Wales through       structured channels; b) creating a reliable evidence base for       common land and c) developing new channels of communication to       disseminate information about common land to a wider public (source 9).
This approach led to the successful bid for a knowledge transfer grant,       `Building Commons Knowledge', awarded by the AHRC for 2012-13.
That       project culminated in a major national conference in July 2013 entitled       `Sustaining the Commons'.
Attended by over 70 delegates, the conference       was tailored to public bodies and stakeholders involved in the management       and protection of common land in England and Wales and provided an       opportunity for the department to present the findings of the `Commons       Stories' initiative, informing policy makers and practitioners how       changing land use and management practices have altered the face of common       land across the 20th century.
The impact of the department's research has       been to deepen an understanding of the processes of change in the past to       enable stakeholders to make informed decisions on sustainable management       for the future.
The significance and reach of the impact are illustrated by further       invitations to the researchers to engage with the work of external bodies       on the future management of common land.
Winchester has been invited to       serve as an `elder' in the Foundation for Common Land.
He and Straughton       have contributed to: Natural England's `Commons Toolkit' publication; a       Surrey County Council Countryside project (source 10); the Lake       District's World Heritage Site inscription process (round- table       discussion on ecosystem services in the Lake District); and a fact-finding       visit by 22 representatives of the Irish government and NGOs in 2012.
In       short, a significant and growing constituency now benefits from the       department's research as the national centre of excellence for the study       of the history of common land.
