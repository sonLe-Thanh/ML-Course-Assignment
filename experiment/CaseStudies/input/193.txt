     [text removed for publication],an [text removed for publication] SME       telecare product provider, has incorporated our research results from the       MEDICATE project relating to mobile-based medication management, for which       Ulster were project co-ordinators, into their flagship telecare product       [text removed for publication].
As a result, [text removed for       publication] have reported increases in revenue, the number of [text       removed for publication] users, and the number of R&amp;D staff they       employ to develop the product.
Based on the outcomes from the MEDICATE Project (2004) it was recommended       by the European Commission/ Review Panel of Experts that efforts should be       made to translate the project findings into commercial products [E1].
Based on this recommendation, CSRI and [text removed for publication]       worked together to build upon the findings from the research (2004-2007).
This led to the incorporation of research results on Internet- and       mobile-based care models [text removed for publication] into [text removed       for publication] product for a mobile phone-based service for medication       management and improved workflow management (stakeholder needs,       information flow between stakeholders, critical path analysis) for       patients, pharmacists, carers and GPs.
Incorporation of this new functionality into [text removed for       publication] during 2008 extended the services previously offered (vital       sign monitoring, agenda management, video-conferencing) [E2].
The       translation of our research results (mobile-based medication management       and workflow management) into the [text removed for publication] product       has been fully recognised and acknowledged by the company, along with the       resulting positive economic impact for [text removed for publication]       [E3].
Since incorporation of the new functionality into the [text removed       for publication] product in 2008, the company has reported:            securing [text removed for publication] contracts for the [text         removed for publication] product, yielding a total revenue of [text         removed for publication] [E3];       creating [text removed for publication] additional new posts for         research and development engineers to further develop the [text removed         for publication] product [E3];       use of the [text removed for publication] system by over 400 users         within the [text removed for publication] region managed by the [text         removed for publication] [E3].
From a healthcare perspective, General Practitioners have reported the       positive benefits of being able to monitor patients remotely using the       [text removed for publication] system without the need for home-based       visits [E4].
From the patients' perspective, positive feedback has been       provided about how [text removed for publication] provides a solution that       offers constant monitoring and communication with a doctor [E4].
The collaboration between CSRI and [text removed for publication] to       develop [text removed for publication] was extended further in 2012       through a Material Transfer Agreement and exclusive licensing option with       CSRI [E5] (which [text removed for publication] opted to progress in June       2013).
The agreement supported the incorporation into [text removed for       publication] of the know-how acquired by CSRI about reminding solutions       for persons with dementia.
This know-how involved the architecture for       video-based reminders being delivered via mobile phones, and the workflow       associated with medication non-compliance.
Prior to this, the [text       removed for publication] platform did not provide tailored solutions for       home-based support of persons with dementia.
A joint commercial venture       between CSRI and [text removed for publication] was established in       November 2012, [text removed for publication] [E6].
The aim of the joint       venture is to provide support for the [text removed for publication]       product within the UK, from both marketing and installation perspectives,       to promote the further uptake of [text removed for publication] within       Europe; [text removed for publication] will also continue to investigate       opportunities to extend the current levels of services that [text removed       for publication] offers.
During 2012 the Institute for Employment Studies were commissioned by the       Social Care Institute for Excellence to seek examples of how technology       had been used to enhance the lives of people with dementia.
The aim of the       work was to draw together all the current research literature within the       domain and to produce an up-to-date best practice guidance document that       would support care workers in their use of technology when working with       people with dementia.
In this process, the Institute for Employment       Studies highlighted the research being undertaken in CSRI relating to       assistive technologies, and Prof Nugent was invited to join an Expert       Panel with a brief to support the production of the best-practice guidance       document.
The outcome of the Expert Panel Workshop led to the production       of a guide for social care providers that is described as "a short       introduction to using information and communication technology (ICT) in       activities for people with dementia" [E7].
The guidance document has been       aimed at managers and staff in the care sector and providers of activities       for people with dementia.
Based also on a general appreciation for the expertise acquired by CSRI       [E8] from our research on technology-based solutions for persons with       dementia, Prof Nugent was also invited by the NI Health and Social Care       R&amp;D Division to join a priority setting exercise to help support the       agenda definition for research into dementia care in Northern Ireland       [E9].
A call for proposals was subsequently launched by the HSC R&amp;D       Office in June 2013, which included the recommendations to include       technology-based solutions as a thematic action line.
