     The research undertaken by MGM and PAB in Kosovo provided the evidence       base for the relocation of residents of the Osterode and Cesmin Lug       refugee camps to a new site at Roma Mahalla, and as a result, to sharp       reductions in blood lead levels and consequently to the eradication of       child and adult mortality from lead poisoning among the RAE refugee       community.
Recommendations from the commissioned research reports were       presented at meetings in Mitrovica (March 2010) attended by the British       Ambassador to Kosovo, the Mayor of Mitrovica, the Kosovan Minister for       Communities and Returns, the Chief Executive Officer of PTK, various NGOs,       the press and leaders from the Roma Mahalla, Osterode and Cesmin Lug       refugee camps.
The reports/presentations triggered widespread media coverage in Kosovo       (newspapers5.1,5.2, television and radio interviews) and the       research was also referred to in a question and answer exchange in the       House of Lords between Lord Avebury and Baroness Kinnock5.3.
The profile gained by such high-level political interest in the UK       provided the momentum for the British Embassy in the UK to press for our       recommendations to be implemented5.4: "In response to         Baroness Kinnock's letter ...... the Kosovo Emergency Medical Group told         UKAGW that they are pleased that the UK Embassy in Pristina has been         working hard to try and get matters moving, and the recent Fluvio lead         testing programme at the camps and Roma Mahalla is a testament both to         their efforts, and that of the scientists involved".
The published       recommendations led directly to the following quantifiable actions and       impacts:     1) In August 2010 construction began on the Roma Mahalla site and by       September 2011 the first phase of the development was complete5.5       &#8212; report recommendation 2.
The two air photographs in Figure 1       show the Roma Mahalla site before (March 2005) and after (September 2011)       housing construction.
2) By September 2010 the Pb-contaminated Cesmin Lug camp had been closed       and this was followed by the closure of Osterode in December 2012 &#8212; report         recommendation 1.
3) Improved knowledge and management of the risks posed by Pb in the       Mitrovica region.
In particular, Fluvio's research-informed recommendation       was to deep-plough and resurface the site to reduce near-surface Pb       levels.
Mercy Corps, the NGO responsible for liaison with the RAE       community, has confirmed that, "your recommendation to deep plough the         site was implemented before construction at a depth of 90 cm and gravel,         from outside Mitrovica, was laid on top of the newly tilled soil for the         123 row houses that were constructed"5.6 &#8212; report         recommendation 3.
4) Improved health and welfare outcomes, especially for children who are       disproportionately susceptible to Pb poisoning.
As reported by Mercy       Corps: "Shortly after their resettlement, more than 200 children, aged         0 to 6 years, had their blood lead levels tested at the local health         clinic working with Mercy Corps.
The results indicated that 82 percent         of these children had elevated blood lead levels above 10 micro-grammes       per decilitre.
Such elevated blood lead levels impair         neuropsychological functions and in particular, those of young children         whose brains are developing.
Treatments are available for the highest         lead levels and diet and hygiene play a role in mitigating         contamination.
However, moving to the lead safe area of Roma Mahalla was         the most important factor in reducing their blood lead level.
Children         resettled for 18 months or more had a median drop in blood lead levels         of 36 percent.
"5.6     5) Following the demonstrable impact of the Roma Mahalla study, Brewer       and Macklin were invited back to Kosovo by Mercy Corps to undertake a       second land contamination assessment.
The aim of this follow-up project       was to identify an environmentally safe site for the relocation of some       RAE families who, for ethnic reasons, could not move to the Roma Mahalla       site3.9.
MGM's and PAB's research was responsible for resolving in Mitrovica,       Kosovo, what has been described by Dorit Nitzan, head of the World Health       Organisation office in Belgrade, as "the worst ever Pb poisoning that we       know of in Europe"5.7.
Their scientific assessments and health       guidance resulted in the lives of more than 160 families, including over       400 children and adults, being saved and protected, and it represents a       benchmark study in the field of environmental toxicology.
