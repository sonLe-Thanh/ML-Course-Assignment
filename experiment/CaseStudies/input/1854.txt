     From da Vinci's The Vitruvian Man through to the experimental       writing of modernists such as Virginia Wolf and James Joyce, scientific       ideas have long informed artistic works.
The collaborative work of Berman       and Still with contemporary artists ensures this tradition survives today.
Collaborating with artists and informing their work     Research carried out at Queen Mary's Centre for Research in String Theory       (CRST) and in the Particle Physics Research Centre (PPRC) has proved a       rich source of inspiration for numerous artists including Grenville Davey,       Jordan Wolfson, Flow Motion, Nelly Ben Hayoun, Lyndall Phelps and       twenty-five artist-participants in Still's Jiggling Atoms       collaboration.
The artists worked directly with researchers and sought to       understand the latest developments in string theory and neutrino physics,       before going on to explore these ideas in a number of artworks.
These       collaborations between artists and CRST and PPRC researchers led to a       significant change in practice for the artists involved, and reached new       and diverse audiences at galleries and art and science fairs.
Secondary       impacts include widespread media coverage, encouraging greater public       discourse about contemporary physics and the latest developments in string       theory and particle physics.
Bringing an artist in residence to the CRST     In 2010, Berman initiated an innovative artist-in-residence post within       the CRST.
Grenville Davey (Turner Prize Winner in 1992 and exhibitor in       the Royal Academy's high-profile Modern British Sculpture exhibition in       2011) was supported by a grant from the Westfield Trust and the Henry       Moore Foundation with the purpose to produce work based on the research of       CRST.
Davey's work over a period of years had been concerned with       symmetries and families of related objects and as such he had a natural       interest in Berman's work on manifesting duality geometrically.
Commenting on his time at CRST and his sculptural responses to the work       on generalized geometry and the role of duality, Davey said: "The work         at Queen Mary on dualities and generalised geometry provides a new         challenging way of seeing...
This is the sort of thing artists search         for and are desperate to find in their work.
My art practice and indeed         specific sculptures have now been directly influenced through         interaction with Dr Berman and the idea of dualities made manifest"       [1].
These works have been shown or will appear at:            Testbed1 (a gallery linked with the Royal College of Art) as part of         the "Our autonomous nature" exhibition (May 2012) in the Chelsea fringe         festival, (with audiences of around 1,000);       Isaac Newton Institute exhibition at Cambridge University Library         (June 2012) as part of an art- science talk (audience of 100);       Financial Services Authority, Canary Wharf (summer 2012);       The Arts Club, a private members club in Mayfair, (October 2013);       Chelsea Space Gallery (April 2014) and Ruskin Gallery in Cambridge         (May 2014).
Award-winning collaboration with Jordan Wolfson at the Frieze Arts         Fair     In 2009, Berman collaborated with conceptual artist Jordan Wolfson to       produce a work for the Frieze Arts Fair, one of the world's leading art       events attracting over 60,000 visitors each year.
The resulting artwork       won that year's prestigious Cartier Award and consisted of several parts,       including a series of one-to-one tours of the fair by CRST string       theorists (Dr Berman, D Thompson, A Low, J Bedford, M McGaurie).
These       tours, described as "nomadic seminars on string theory", introduced over       300 influential artists, art journalists, curators and gallery owners to       the conceptual aspects of string theory research at the CRST.
A further       300 people watched the tours take place and the conversations were       recorded, edited and used by the artist as a script for a live       performance.
This led to a further commission (worth &#163;10,000) for Wolfson,       which led him to make "Your Napoleon: an intervention based on the string       theory of physics" [2,3].
The resulting impact on public discourse via media coverage     The project at the Frieze Arts Fair attracted attention not only from the       60,000 attendees but also in the widespread arts media coverage in the Guardian,       New York Times, Wired Magazine, and The Arts Magazine       [8].
The presence of science-inspired stories in the arts media (and of       arts-inspired stories in the lay-science media) clearly demonstrates the       impact the work has had in building an awareness of science/art       collaborations.
This awareness has manifested in an invited article about       the collaboration in New Scientist [9].
Berman's work with Davey       has also received attention internationally with an invited talk and       subsequent article about the collaboration for the Korean Institute for       Advanced Study (September 2012) and for the Japanese popular science       magazine Parity (autumn 2013).
A talk and exhibition of the Davey       collaboration at the private members club The Arts Club in London took       place in October 2013.
One of the Guardian's cultural critics Sam Wollaston wrote of his       experience at the Frieze Arts Fair: "Part of a project devised by US         artist Jordan Wolfson, the strolling chat with Dr Berman quickly gets         beyond three dimensions to four, which I'm just about OK with (the         fourth is time), but then he's suddenly talking about 10 of them.
Ten         dimensions!
It works mathematically, apparently.
And these dimensions         are really small and tightly rolled up - Berman demonstrates this with         my notebook....... it sounds beautiful."
(Guardian, 15       October 2009.)
Other CRST work with artists     CRST research on dualities has also influenced the sound artists Flow       Motion [4], who created a piece called "Exploring eleven dimensions".
This       artwork was produced in direct response to extensive discussions with Dr       Berman and Dr James Sparks (Oxford) regarding ideas in M-theory.
Performed       to audiences of 250 at the Science Museum's Dana Centre and at Queen Mary       in November 2011, it was funded by an EPSRC pathways to impact grant.
Dr       Berman has also given talks on his research, and its role in his       arts-collaborations, at the Institute for Contemporary Art, Tate Modern,       the Royal College of Art, and the Core Gallery, with audience numbers       being around 100 for each event.
After listening to one of Berman's talks       artist Lia Perjovski said: "M-theory does what art should do: it         challenges our view of the world and challenges what I mean [by] art."
Berman will be curating an exhibition at the Ruskin and Chelsea Space       Galleries in 2014, and has previously curated an exhibition at Clare Hall,       Cambridge in 2008.
Evelyn Wilson, Director, The Culture Capital Exchange, attested to the       value of the CRST working with artists: "It is the kind of         ground-breaking collaborations that are being fostered so carefully at         Queen Mary that is paving the way for so many more of us to think afresh         about world in which we live."
The CRST's arts engagement strategy       is on-going with plans to continue the artist-in- residency programme into       2014/15 accompanying the previously mentioned exhibitions scheduled for       2014.
PPRC work with artists     Dr Still has received two IoP awards for his collaborative work with       artists [11].
He worked with designer Nelly Ben Hayoun on the Super K         Sonic Booooum!
installation, an immersive mock-up of the T2K       neutrino experiment that was exhibited at a London nightclub in 2009 and       at the Manchester Science fair in 2010.
More than 1600 visitors       experienced an interactive boat ride through the installation accompanied       by a PPRC researcher who acted as a tour guide explaining the PPRC's       neutrino physics research.
An accompanying blog and website describing the       research behind the installation had more than 3000 unique visits over the       duration of the exhibit.
An STFC Science in Society grant (&#163;8.8K) funded       the collaboration.
Jiggling Atoms was a six-month collaboration       between Still and 25 artists that resulted in a strong impact on their       artistic practice and enhanced awareness of PPRC's particle physics       research [6].
Visual interpretations of complex neutrino physics concepts       were created in response to conversations and lectures about the PPRC's       research, including illustrations and sculptures depicting neutrino       oscillations.
These were exhibited at a week long physics festival hosted       by a London gallery during October 2012, that also included talks and       discussions by Still, and was attended by over 1000 visitors.
More recently, Still was chosen to pioneer the new IoP       artist-in-residence programme Superposition, in partnership with       contemporary artist Lyndall Phelps, which ran for a year from October       2012.
This culminated in a sculpture that symbolizes the detection of       neutrinos in the T2K experiment and the associated data analysis.
This was       exhibited at the London Canal Museum during September and October 2013       with over 1900 visitors.
An accompanying brochure contains essays by Still       and Tom Freshwater, the Contemporary Art Programme Manager at the National       Trust that discuss the scientific and artistic significance of the       sculpture       (http://ph.qmul.ac.uk/sites/default/files/REF/SUPERPOSITION_BOOKLET.pdf).
After working on the Superposition project Lyndall Phelps commented "...I         was hooked straight away, especially after seeing images of         Super-Kamiokande.
My pre-conception that physics might be a tad dry and         abstract was shattered, replaced by the promise of poetry and rich         sensory experiences" [5].
