     In line with the five strands outlined above, three types of impact have       emerged: the use of       frameworks and principles; the uptake and use of data       produced from the research; and the direct       use of findings to support decision making around policy and           practice.
Hitherto, serviceable       evidence in this field has been hard to access, and habitually tricky to       synthesise in a meaningful       manner.
This research effectively resolves this impasse via: Directed         stakeholder partnership         programmes (ASCCUE/SCORCHIO); Knowledge-transfer programmes       (GRaBS); and       Funders directly assisting policy and practice/or as direct users       (EcoCities/CCJV/CJ).
The       majority of beneficiaries are planning, development or environmental       management practitioners.
Significantly, whilst much of the impact concerns policy and practice in       climate adaptation, there is       strong evidence of pedagogical impact, principally around web-based       resources for schools,       awareness-raising and training [4].
As a whole, users fall into two broad       groups:             Partners in research or research-related knowledge transfer         activities (often formally         recognised in project proposals).
These groups demonstrate the most         extensive use of         findings, and assist in the shaping and dissemination of research.
For         instance, SCORCHIO         utilised a dedicated `stakeholder champion' in order to persuade the         Government of the need to         prioritise action on overheating in UK cities, with DCLG subsequently "investigating           evidence         and policy options around overheating and the built environment as a           priority" [2].
Second-wave adopters including many local authorities.
Whilst         not directly involved in the         research, these users are reached through subsequent targeted         dissemination and outreach         activities by researchers, funding bodies or third parties [1].
In Greater Manchester research uptake has significantly       influenced policy and practice.
The value       of UMTs was recognised by the Association of Greater Manchester       Authorities (AGMA), with       Manchester City Council (MCC) referring at length to ASCCUE's approach to       the consequences of       climate change, and formalising the strong partnership between MCC and UoM       within a       `Memorandum of Understanding' in 2009 [1].
The MCC collaboration has also       informed local       campaigns (e.g.
the `Call to Real Action' blog), with Ecocities and       SCORCHIO also referenced on       Salford City Council's local information portal, and in their 2010 climate       strategy [1].
Rochdale MBC       used SCORCHIO heat emissions and building-modelling work to guide energy       management       strategies for Rochdale town centre, with ASCCUE evidence supporting their       `green infrastructure'       emphasis [1].
Similarly, Wigan MBC have made extensive use of research       outputs from CCJV and       SCORCHIO, their Sustainability Manager noting that "this data... is an         invaluable resource for         considering the vulnerability issues of Wigan... we are revising our         climate change strategy and         action plan and will place a particular focus on climate change         adaptation.
The data will be integral         to how we develop this" [9].
Finally, consultants Scott Wilson used       ASCCUE materials (UMT data)       within their core Greater Manchester evidence base for AGMA [1], and       Community Forests North       West have produced a `Green Infrastructure' plan informed by UoM research       [4].
National impact: UoM research has inputted into the 2012       `UK Climate Change Risk Assessment'       [2], and the Adaptation Sub-committee's work on spatial indicators [3].
UMT data have been       provided to local authorities, consultants and groups including Natural       England and the       Environment Agency, via a UoM-approved data agreement.
Data have also been       used by local         authorities outside Greater Manchester, via research partnerships       (e.g.
London Borough of       Sutton), or independently (e.g.
Islington Council), where findings       are worked into bespoke       adaptation guides [1].
Such `independent users' are often made aware of       the research through       national advisory networks, such as the Planning Advisory Service       (PAS) who have effectively       summarised the research, linking directly to ASCCUE and SCORCHIO [3].
The       model developed       in Manchester is also gaining traction, with a consultancy report written       for the `Local and Regional       Adaptation Partnership Board' noting UHI work in Birmingham that is "building         on the University of         Manchester's ASCCUE project", extolling the close working       relationship between UoM and MCC       [1].
Other examples of the uptake of this research include the use of       ASCCUE by the Technology       Strategy Board [3], by Groundwork UK and by the Glasgow and Clyde Valley       Green Network       Partnership, as part of their parliamentary lobbying activities [4].
Regional impact: Extending the reach of the initial       research [A], JRF and four regional climate       change partnerships have sponsored engagement activities.
These have       provided a `fresh       perspective' on risk and vulnerability beyond a focus on hazard-exposure,       and explored the       `mainstreaming' of adaptation planning into existing activity [6].
Accordingly, the Leicestershire       Climate Ready Plan (Feb 2013) has a nominated lead, with a responsibility       to `map socio-spatial       vulnerability to climate change in Leicestershire' [10].
An independent       evaluation of JRF's `Climate       Change and Social Justice' programme identified [A] as one of its most       important pieces of       commissioned research, with "the maps of social vulnerability and         climate impacts... used by the         Chair of the [UK Government] Adaptation Sub Committee, Lord         Krebs, in public presentations" [6].
Practitioners also welcomed "tangible data not previously presented to         policy makers", with JRF's       Programme Manager citing a local authority testimonial: "I think it         could make a difference to how         services are delivered in the future for example through the relocation         of adult day care centres"       [6].
Following an invited presentation to the Scottish Government (May       2012), a follow-up to CCJV       was funded and will be used in shaping the forthcoming Scottish Climate       Change Adaptation       Programme [7].
The Welsh Government have also used CCJV vulnerability data       for engagement       purposes, a representative noting that [A] was "particularly useful as         this had a Welsh perspective         and looked at a number of different angles that I had not seen covered         elsewhere e.g.
deprivation         and access to services"[6].
UoM will contribute to two ministerial       events in Wales, later in 2013.     International impact: CLUVA has facilitated development of       UMT datasets for five African cities       (Addis Ababa, Dar es Salaam, Saint-Louis, Douala and Ouagadougou).
In       Addis Ababa, the       dataset is forming the backbone of a city `Master Plan' (May 2013), with       the City Planning Project       Office noting: "The green infrastructure plan being developed as part         of the Addis Ababa Master         plan is using the concept of Urban Morphology Types and the geographical         framework developed         through mapping corresponding UMT units for the city.
The decision to         use this framework has         come about because of the work published by Gill et al...
The UMT         framework has provided an         important geographical framework through which indicators of urban         ecosystem services and the         multi-functionality of green structures within Addis Ababa can be         expressed... providing an         evidence base for justifying green structure priorities for the city"       [8].
UoM is also working closely       with early adopters of ASCCUE outputs, the Mersey Forest (MF), to maximise       the international       impact of CLUVA ecosystem service assessment work; MF report: "an         exciting opportunity to take         the approaches we have been developing ....and apply them in a vastly         different context" [5].
Finally, the European Commission has commended ASCCUE, utilising       findings in their work on       vulnerabilities inherent in the `compact city' [5], and awarding GraBS       with the European       Commission's DG for Regional Policy `RegioStars Award' for the best       project in the Sustainable       Growth category (one of 5 awards from 107 entries).
The jury stated: "While         there are many         projects working on the environmental aspects of green and blue         infrastructure, this project goes         further in assessing the social and economic benefits..." [5].
As a       result of the co-creation of       adaptation responses, 11 European municipalities and regions &#8212; including       the Province of Genoa       and Nieuw-West in Amsterdam &#8212; now have evidence-based adaptation       strategies in place.
