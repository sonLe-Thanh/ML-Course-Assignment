     Impact 1.
Engaging with pharmaceutical companies to introduce new pain         therapeutic agents     Work relating to the first two papers referenced in section 3 [R1, 2] was       instrumental in the development of a new class of therapies that       significantly reduced the extent of gastrointestinal side effects evident       in other therapies for pain relief:     "At the time of the development of the new therapeutic agents &#8212; Cox II         inhibitors (coxibs) &#8212; for the management of chronic pain by the         pharmaceutical industry, little was known about the scope and health         economic impact of NSAID-related adverse experiences.
Dr Phillips' work         studying the clinical impact of these types of AEs (adverse effects) and         quantifying the healthcare resource utilization employed by clinical         practice was very important to help gain an understanding [of] the         economic impact of introducing coxibs to clinical practice.
Dr Phillips,         in collaboration with Dr Moore and Merck researchers, was instrumental         in the development of the first health economic analyses of the coxibs."
(Head of Economics and Statistics, Merck Corporation) [C1]     There were some 940,000 prescriptions for coxibs in England, Scotland and       Wales during 2012, which represents over 5% of total analgesic       prescribing.
The drugs are of major benefit to patients who previously had       major problems in securing pain relief due to the side effects associated       with the alternative therapies.
Impact 2.
Re-focusing patient management     Findings from the research programme on costs associated with chronic       pain [R3-4] led to Phillips contributing to the development of NICE       guidance for employers, NHS and other professionals and managers involved       in the management of long-term sickness absence and incapacity.
He has       also contributed to clinical update sessions for medical professionals,       including recent meetings at the Royal College of Anaesthetists and Royal       College of General Practitioners.
Further, a Welsh Government commissioned       evaluation of costs and benefits of an early physiotherapy intervention       [R6] which demonstrated significant improvements in clinical and quality       of life measures and sickness absence rates.
This work was a key component       in assessing the need for a national occupational health service for       Wales, and in informing the evidence base for Fit for Work pilots &#8212; a       major component of the UK government's policy of welfare reform:     "The impact of the Occupational Health and Physiotherapy Pilot       [i.e., R6] was fed in, following Dame Carol Black's Review, to support         the evidence base for the Department of Work and Pensions `Fit for Work'         pilots - 11 pilots were introduced, with 7 being extended."
(Head of       Workplace Settings, Welsh Government) [C2]     In addition, the impact of the research has been acknowledged by patient       groups:     "... vouch that his work has greatly impacted on elevating the status         of pain management within the UK and further afield from the patient         perspective.
Professor Phillips' work on the impact of pain is         recognised and valued within the EU pain community and has served to         increase awareness of pain at a political level to support the patients'         voice in getting a higher priority for the management of pain"       (Patient representative) [C2]     Impact 3.
Enhancing the status of pain and its management in the         development of health policy and practice     Research findings (R3-4) have also been widely used to influence policy       developments in UK and overseas.
For example, findings were used to inform       a chapter in the Chief Medical Officer of Health Annual Report 2008 -       entitled "Pain: breaking through the barrier."
"The research findings [i.e., R3] were influential in framing         the chapter on pain in the CMO Report and the data his work has produced         on costs and burden of pain provided a useful background to the chapter         and the need for concerted action to initiate evidence-based policies         and treatments to grapple with the problem.
His direct input discussing         the direction and content for the chapter and offering support and         suggesting refinements was greatly valued at the time.
His on-going         involvement in UK-wide discussions about public and health policy to         reduce the burden of ill health from chronic pain remains greatly         appreciated" (Senior Clinical Advisor to Chief Medical Officer,       England) [C3]     The opening section of the chapter &#8212; entitled Impact on Lives &#8212; was       largely drawn from the data synthesised in references R3 and R4.
Further,       the research helped to formulate policy development in Canada:     "We are just beginning discussions here in relation to a provincial         policy strategy for the management of chronic pain.....Your paper on         chronic pain burden [R3] will be very useful....please let us         know if we can share your document" (Head of Pain Management,       Calgary Health Region, Alberta, Canada ) [C3]     and was widely utilised in developing the Welsh Service Directive and       Commissioning Directive (2008) on chronic non-malignant pain &#8212; a key       strategic document in establishing and developing pain services in Welsh       hospitals.
Thus Phillips'     ".....contribution was invaluable in helping to ensure that we were         able to outline an approach for Wales which was evidence based taking         full account of both the clinical and cost effective impacts on         improving the management of this across Wales.
This was pioneering work         at the time with Wales the first country in the UK to produce such         policy guidance" [C3]     A written response to an Assembly question given by the Welsh Minister on       9th July 2013 indicated that Health Boards had achieved 87% compliance       with the actions within the above document to establish more robust       community pain services linked with secondary care to support more       effective pain management.
Impact 4.
Increasing the awareness within the political community of         the societal burden of pain     Research findings [R1-R6] have also been used to raise political       awareness of pain and its management.
Presentations at the Parliamentary       Health Group (House of Commons, 2003 and 2004) were instrumental in the       formation of the Chronic Pain Coalition &#8212; a forum established in 2006 to       unite patients, professionals and parliamentarians in a mission to develop       an improved strategy for the prevention, treatment and management of       chronic pain and its associated conditions.
"Through his research into the socio-economic impact of pain and its         treatment modalities, he is acknowledged nationally as the leading         health economist in our speciality area.
His detailed research work has         been instrumental in establishing pain as an important long term         condition, with profound impact on patients' quality of life, NHS         workload and costs, as well as wider societal costs through loss of         productivity and benefits/pensions" (Past President, British Pain       Society) [C4].
Phillips also presented sessions at a Europe against Pain Conference       (Brussels 2010) and Societal Impact of Pain Conference (Brussels 2011) -       to increase awareness among politicians and policy makers at a European       level of the impact of pain on society and the need for concerted action       to alleviate the impact on individuals and societies.
A testimonial to the       impact of the work from one of the main sponsors of the initiative is       provided below:     "The concept of `Societal Impact of Pain' can be traced to your         analysis, presentations and publications and led me to invite the         European Federation of IASP Chapters board to enter a dialogue in         Brussels with policy makers on the prioritization of pain management in         the health care system.
The roadmap for action on pain management that         emerged from the series of meetings in Brussels was inspired by your         publications and you have fuelled the discussion in a far wider sphere         of influence than the UK" (Head of Political Affairs, Gr&#252;nenthal       GmbH &#8212; major pharmaceutical company in pain management) [C4].
The methods developed in assessing the full range of costs and benefits       (including the adverse events) of pain management have been subsequently       applied, with funding from a number of sources, to other conditions and       healthcare interventions, including cancer, dentistry, multiple sclerosis,       public health and wound management, impacting on policy, practice and       therapeutic developments in each of these areas.
