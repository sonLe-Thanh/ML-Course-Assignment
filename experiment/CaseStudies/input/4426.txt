     The Suburban Birmingham: Spaces and Places, 1880-1960 project       helped improve the research skills of staff from the partner       organisations, shaped temporary displays at LoB and led to the redesign of       BMAG's new &#163;10m Birmingham History Galleries.
The displays enhanced wider       public engagement with Birmingham's understanding of the city's past,       further enriched by their installation of an AHRC-funded follow-on       project's multi-user, multi-touch interactives.
The new Suburban         Birmingham website also ensured that similar benefits reached a far       larger audience regionally, nationally, and internationally.
The initial AHRC Boulton network enabled curatorial and archival staff of       the partner cultural organisations to shape research outputs (notably,       Clay's exhibition at the Barber Institute and its catalogue to which a       BMAG curator contributed).
This formed the basis for the joint AHRC       application with BMAG and LoB on the history of Birmingham's south-western       suburbs between 1880 and 1960.
This was in tandem with a &#163;10m HLF bid for       funds for redevelopment of the Birmingham History Gallery of BMAG (see       source 1 below).
The Suburban Birmingham project led BMAG's       Interim Director, to say that `we have achieved a paradigm shift in our       collaborative working that will continue to deliver benefits for our       staff, our organisation and our visitors' (source 2).
The impact of the       project can be summarised as follows:     Professional Development     In the Birmingham Suburbs project's first year a curator (BMAG)       and an archivist (LoB) were bought out to serve as `Fellows' and conduct       research alongside the academic team for one week a month for each year of       the project.
By working closely with the academics the `Fellows' improved       their:            research skills (especially with regard to the use of visual evidence)       written communication of research findings in the form of scholarly         texts (published on the website and the multi-touch outputs of the new         Birmingham History galleries.
verbal communication of research findings in the form of presentations         given at: Project Continuity Days; the project's launch event in         February 2013 filmed by the AHRC for their website; scholarly         conferences after the project's completion       cross-institutional working that resulted from all `Fellows' making         use of all partner collections in their research          As the BMAG Head of Programming, notes, `The agenda was always to       encourage more cross-working between the museums and the partner       institutions.
It has really empowered our staff.
Usually you find a       curator is supporting academics at the University to broaden their       knowledge.
But this has given them greater knowledge and the skills to       expand it in terms of curating the collections here at the museum' (source       3).
For BMAG Interim Director, `The project has made a real impact and       delivered tangible benefits not least of which is [...] the continuing       professional development of partners' staff' (source 2).
Museums Practices and Policy     At the end of the first year of the Suburban Birmingham project,       the designs for the new &#163;10m HLF-funded Birmingham History Galleries       (opened October 2012) were redrawn to accommodate the research findings of       curators, specifically by creating more space dedicated to the history of       the suburbs.
As part of its Community Engagement strategy, BMAG also       conducted additional research in 2012 to complement the work of the Suburban         Birmingham project &#8212; commissioning 4 oral history interviews with       elder residents of the areas studied by the project.
Wider Public Engagement     Figures show that an average of 515 people visit the galleries each day       (sources 4 and 5).
As such, the project succeeded in its aim of meeting       the demand of the Birmingham public for a gallery that enhanced their       knowledge and understanding of suburban histories.
However, Suburban         Birmingham's major website also reaches a much wider audience,       promoting the city's collections, its scholarship and its heritage       expertise globally.
The project website includes 8 scholarly essays written by the research       team that can be read online or downloaded as illustrated PDF files.
It       also allows access to hundreds of objects that would otherwise remain       hidden in the partner collections' stories, offering 6 galleries of over       240 digitised artefacts from the partner collections 120 of which have       interpretative texts of c.500 words written about them.
Between July and       October 2012, the website attracted 400-500 new visitors each month, 11%       of hits were on mobile devices, 50% of which were by Ipad.
Hits came from:       UK, USA, Australia, India, Canada, Netherlands, China, Japan, New Zealand,       Switzerland, Thailand, Germany, Lithuania, Belgium, Brazil, and Malaysia.
Following the official launch of the website in February 2013, those       figures rose to 879 per month in March and averaging 627 April-June and       the global reach extended to include: Spain, Finland, Russia, Poland,       Hungary, Sweden, and Taiwan (source 6).
Visitor Experience     Supported by a &#163;32k AHRC Follow Up grant for Suburban Birmingham:         Hands On, a team made up of Clay, an SME graphic designer, a       computer coder and a Human Computer Interaction user tester from       University of Birmingham produced a multi-user, multi-touch version of the       website data so that visitors to the partners' collection space could       access by intuitive touch 120 objects and interpretative texts from the       website.
This innovative output is now running on 50-inch, multi-touch       interfaces in the BMAG Birmingham History Gallery, the &#163;192m Library of       Birmingham (opened September 2013), and the Cadbury Research Library.
As       BMAG's Head of IT, has noted, `The multi-touch solution is wonderful, it       is great to watch users discussing their memories and debating history       more broadly.
I think the ease of use is important in this, and of course       the content itself which is so rich.
The Suburbs screen and the touchtable       allow for so much greater interaction between users than most other       interactives, and as a result I feel it provides a greater experience,       both in terms of enjoyment and learning' (source 7).
BMAG's new gallery       exceeded its visitor target of 50,200 during its first 6 months, achieving       102,800 visitors, averaging 515 visits per day by July 2013 (sources 4 and       5).
Between 23 April and 19 August 2013, there were 31,238 interactions       made with the Hands On interactive in BMAG, i.e.
an average of 265       interactions per day with users accessing over 10,000 images that would       otherwise have been inaccessible in the gallery space (source 8).
Further Beneficiaries     Suburban Birmingham laid the foundations for a new culture of       collaborative research between the University of Birmingham and the city's       major cultural institutions &#8212; its impact has subsequently reached far       beyond the city.
The Library of Birmingham and BMAG were so impressed by the impact of Suburban         Birmingham and Suburban Birmingham: Hands On upon their       staff's professional development and on audience experiences that they       became partners on a &#163;2.4m ERDF project, The Digital Heritage         Demonstrator (DHD), led by Clay and Dr Chapman (Department of       Archaeology, University of Birmingham) that began in October 2011.
Their       support also helped bring in the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust (IGMT) and       the Worcestershire HIVE archive as partners.
The project enables academics to work with SMEs and the cultural partners       to produce multi-touch solutions that enrich visitor experiences in the       partners' display spaces by enabling intuitive access to collections and       interpretative materials.
To date, multi-touch software has been completed       for Birmingham History Galleries at BMAG, the new LoB, the HIVE       (shortlisted for the 2013 Museum and Heritage national award for       innovation), with outputs in preparation for IGMT.
As the Interim Director       of BMAG has noted, the Suburban Birmingham project has enabled a       `blossoming relationship with UB &#8212; not least the ERDF project' (source 2).
The project has had a significant impact internationally.
Clay and       Grosvenor were invited to serve as consultants on the City of Chicago         Cultural Plan 2012 (source 9 &#8212; the only other international HEI       consulted was University of Toronto) and along with Hemsoll have now       submitted a &#163;1.9m AHRC `Care for the Future' bid focused on the histories       of the home with partners in Chicago including: The Smart Museum, The       Oriental Institute, the National Public Housing Museum, Hull House Museum,       the Electronic Visualisation Lab, and the Art Institute of Chicago), BMAG,       LoB and the National Trust.
As the British Consul General, has noted,       `University of Birmingham has had a rapid and tangible impact in the       Midwest [...].
UB's vision of Triple Helix collaboration between the       cultural sector, businesses, and universities has helped to shape the City         of Chicago Cultural Plan 2012.
It is wonderful to hear that the       `Birmingham model' of partnership working is now leading to the       development of a major grant application in partnership with the       University of Chicago, the city's museums, University of Birmingham and       Birmingham's own library and its Museum Trust' (source 10).
The       foundations of such international, cross-sector collaboration were       established by the Suburban Birmingham project.
As an AHRC national case study for social impact, the project and its       follow-on also featured on the cover of the AHRC's Impact of AHRC         Research report to DCMS in 2011 and were discussed under two       separate headings over 2 pages (source 11).
