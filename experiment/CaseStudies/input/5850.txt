     NIP has been committed to developing channels that lead its research       projects to benefit non- academic partners.
This process is overseen by       the NIP Outreach and Knowledge and Transfer Officer (Luzzi), who is       primarily responsible for creating partnerships with non-academic       organizations and for research dissemination.
The process is clearly       collaborative, with members of the research teams contributing their       research expertise, their presentational and discussion- facilitation       skills and suggestions of ways their research can achieve impact.
The main       aim of these activities is not simply to disseminate research by exposing       non-academic groups to cutting-edge research issues in philosophy; it is       also&#8212;and crucially&#8212;to involve such groups in the NIP-inspired practice of       collaborative discussion, where views are put forward, revised and       sharpened in the light of friendly criticism in order to reach a deeper       understanding of genuinely puzzling issues.
This attitude encompasses the       methodology underpinning our Caf&#233; Philosophique programme, our       Philosophy courses run in schools, in prison (HMP Aberdeen) and with       unemployed persons and ex-drug abusers (AberdeenFoyer).
NIP Public       activities to date have engaged roughly 400 individuals and can be divided       broadly into four streams: social partnerships, public         engagement, teacher training and school collaborations.
Social partnerships take the shape of a series of weekly group       discussions on Philosophy research themes with prisoners (HMP Aberdeen)       and young unemployed, homeless or ex-drug abusers (AberdeenFoyer).
In the       period 2012-2013, Luzzi ran three six-week courses with       AberdeenFoyer involving a total of 26 participants and one three-week and       one six-week course with HMP Aberdeen involving 11 prisoners overall.
A       prison-based social worker said:     `I think it was great for the guys to have access to learning that         wasn't dumbed down and that was outside the box, but relevant.
Professionally I think being involved with your group enabled me to         think about the guys' lives in a different way and enabled me to develop         my working relationships and touched on my own professional reformist         beliefs'     The Caf&#233; Philosophique public engagement programme was       launched in Spring 2012 and the second series took place in Spring 2013.
In these events, researchers present their recent research to the public       in an accessible way and, in those led by Aberdeen researchers, small       tutorial-style discussion on research themes with the public       (facilitated by a faculty member) take place.
Caf&#233; Philosophique       comprised five events led by Aberdeen researchers: Baker/Plakias       (`When Should We Tolerate Moral Disagreement?
'), McGlynn (`How Do We Know       Ourselves?
'), Jezzi (`What Are Our Moral Obligations to the Global       Poor?
'), Torre (`Is Time Travel Possible'), Berto (`What       Can Paradoxes Teach Us?
'); and two NIP Public Lectures delivered by Prof.       David Chalmers (NYU/ANU) on `The Matrix As Metaphysics' and Prof Jennifer       Saul (Sheffield) on `Implicit Bias Against Women').
Roughly 210 people       attended the events led by Aberdeen researchers overall, while a total of       230 attended the Public Lectures.
The sessions led by Aberdeen staff were       particularly well-received.
Testimonials from the public on these sessions       (available at http://tinyurl.com/kglphd8)       include:     `Thought-provoking discussion.'
`The group discussion was very interesting.
It was also well-moderated.
This allowed a range of views to be expressed.'
`Excellent initiative&#8212;organisers should be congratulated.
Overall I         thought it went extremely well, a great example of innovative public         engagement.'
`The theories well-introduced in a lively, open and accessible way.
Very appealing for non- academic philosophers to get involved.'
`A very lively, informative evening of hearing and sharing thoughts and         views on Philosophy.'
`I really liked the informal, friendly atmosphere and how others at         the talk shared their views.'
For the teacher training stream of NIP public, Luzzi       designed and twice taught the one-day Continual Professional Development       course `Philosophy in the Classroom' (Nov 2012 and May 2013).
The aim of       the course was to introduce primary and secondary schoolteachers to the       benefits of using the collaborative group discussion model of NIP in a       classroom setting.
Both courses were fully booked, with a total of 38       educators in attendance.
Evaluation sheets from participants (available at       http://www.abdn.ac.uk/nip/page?id=47)       provided evidence of impact:     Evaluation Question: `Attending this course will         probably have effects on my teaching/work' (Possible answers from 1 =         strongly disagree to 10 = strongly agree).
Answers: one 6, one 7, two 8s, three 9s, eleven 10s.
Further comments indicate that the course proved valuable for       participants:     `...raring to go and work with my class on this!'
`I enjoyed learning about the process of how to run a Philosophy with         Children inquiry and would use this model in a primary classroom.'
`I found the inquiry sessions to be excellent both for engaging in         discussion but also to look at how to manage philosophical discussions.'
`All areas very good but Inquiry sessions were very helpful as they         gave practical ideas of how to go about this.'
The school collaborations stream includes several partnerships       with local primary and secondary schools.
Since January 2012 Luzzi       has run twenty-eight hour-long Philosophy group discussions with pupils       from St Peter's Primary School.
From January to July 2012 he worked with a       P5 class while from January to March 2013 he worked with a P3 and a P6       class.
A total of 60 pupils were involved.
Since 2011, NIP has obtained funding from the Royal Institute of       Philosophy to run Philosophy courses of 15 contact hours in local       secondary schools.
The courses' topics are taken from areas of strong       research expertise and the NIP model of collaborative group discussion is       typically implemented in these sessions.
Collaborations have taken place       with Dyce Academy (Luzzi, Spring 2011, 60 pupils), Albyn School (Melis       (PhD student), Spring 2012, 70 pupils; Spring 2013, 70 pupils), and Robert       Gordon's College (Luzzi, Spring 2011, 50 pupils; Melis,       Spring 2012, 35 pupils).
The NIP research model of collaborative discussion of central       philosophical questions encompasses all four streams.
The specific       research outputs mentioned in section 3 were used as foundations in the       development and refinement of lesson plans with accompanying activities       and stimuli for group discussion that were used in three of the streams:       social partnerships, school collaborations and public engagement.
For       example, in the wake of research activity on the "Basic Knowledge"       project, NIP developed a lesson plan centered on the topic of so-called       `lottery' scepticism for use in non-academic settings.
Initially, this was       tested as one of the Philosophy sessions of five five-session mini-courses       running at Robert Gordon's College (22, 23 and 24 March 2011) and two       five-session mini-courses at Dyce Academy (23, 25 March 2011).
On the       basis of this experience, the lesson plan was revised and adjusted for use       as part of five five-week Philosophy courses at Albyn School (March 2012);       as part of three five-week Philosophy courses at Robert Gordon's College       (March 2012); as part of two six-week Philosophy courses on the Lifeshapers       programme for young unemployed persons and ex-drug abusers run by the       charity AberdeenFoyer (25 June 2012, 05 Sep 2012); as part of a three-week       Philosophy course for prisoners at HM Prison Aberdeen Grampian (6 July       2012); for an Aberdeen Skeptics in the Pub public engagement       session (22 November 2012, Cellar 32 pub, audience of 23).
