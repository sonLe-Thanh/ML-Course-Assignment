     There are 3 impacts from our new AFTER intervention research, namely:     (1) A new readily attainable measure of fear of recurrence.
(2) The delivery of training and implementation of the AFTER intervention       into clinical practice.
(3) Improvement in quality of patient care.
In the enhancement of the AFTER intervention, Humphris and Ozakinci       designed a new readily       attainable fear of recurrence measure developed at St Andrews in 2007.
It       has good psychometric       qualities, is brief and is being used in a major case-control study (NIHR)       known as the H&amp;N5000       study which Humphris acted as a consultant.
Over 1000 cases have been       collected &#8212; the largest       cancer patient sample with this assessment.S6The identification       of high FoR patients is vital to       enable efficient referral for important support services of which AFTER is       the only dedicated       intervention currently available for targeting this major clinical issue.
A Clinical Service is provided by Humphris (Consultant Clinical       Psychologist) and Ozakinci       (Cognitive Behaviour Therapist) who use the AFTER intervention in the       internationally renowned       NHS Lothian Edinburgh Cancer Centre for out-patients referred by clinical       specialists.
This case       series has been applied (2009 to present) so that approximately a sixth of       patients referred to the       service will benefit from the therapeutic elements contained in the AFTER       intervention.
The       success of this application has prompted the Head of Psychological Service       at the Edinburgh       Cancer Centre to report: "I have seen at first hand the benefit of         their innovative research on         AFTER with patients referred to my service."
S1     The intervention has generated both recognition and invitations to run       training events for the North       of England Cancer Network.
Training workshops were conducted on the AFTER       intervention with     UK Cancer Units:            North East of England Regional Clinical Psychology Services (18th         Feb 2013)       North of England Cancer Network (18th Mar 2013) for cancer         service `roll-out' in North of         England.S7           Approximately 25-30 delegates attended each one-day workshop, run by       Humphris, to: (i) translate       the research, (ii) explain the intervention manual, and (iii) enable       health professionals attending       (psychologists, counsellors and specialist cancer nurses) to deploy the       intervention.
The Head of       Cumbria Psychological Services' Consultant Clinical Psychologist has       employed a staff member       (May 2013) specifically for AFTER intervention application has stated: "We         are therefore able to         use this work of the Health Psychology team at the University of St         Andrews to deliver         improvements in Health care in routine practice"S2Furthermore,       the Consultant Clinical     Psychologist from the Northern Centre for Cancer Care provides additional       support by saying: "All         of us ... are aware what a significant issue Fear of Recurrence is for         our patients and their carers.
Your work provides a very useful framework for enabling practitioners to         address this with patients,         in order to facilitate enhanced coping and reduce psychological         distress" S3     On the strength of these events, other European and International         Cancer Centres are adopting       the AFTER for use in the EU and North America for example:            The Centre de Psycho-oncologie, Brussels, Belgium (6th May         2013) the only centre of its kind         in Belgium, invited Humphris to train their 15 psychologists and         specialist cancer nurses in the         practice of using AFTER.
This attracted 30 delegates and was strongly         positively rated.
The         Head of the Unit of Psychosomatic and Psycho-oncology Research states         that "this           intervention will have an impact on the care of cancer patients and           reduce the distress many of           them experience during recovery from treatment"S4        A similar event was held in McGill University, Montreal (5th         April 2013), Canada.
Within         Quebec the internationally recognised Psycho-oncologist has stated         recently that: " ...the           AFTER intervention has made a great contribution to our efforts to           attempt to assist cancer           patients with high levels of fear of recurrence" S5        It has recently (2013) received independent support in a major         randomised controlled trial         conducted in the Netherlands.S6           These training activities across key centres has attracted a 12 month       Innovation Grant Award in       April 2013 from NHS Fife R&amp;D (&#163;20k) to develop further implementation       of the AFTER intervention       into cancer services.
The grant includes resources for training workshops,       and staff supervision to       build a targeted service for NHS patients.
These workshops were run       locally (August-October       2013) and engaged multi-disciplinary staff.
Currently, the intervention is       being applied routinely in       the breast cancer services under supervision from Humphris.
License       preparation is in final stages       for health service users to receive downloadable copies of the AFTER       manual for a small       consideration to cover production costs and receive email supervision of       use of material with       oncology patients.
Finally, the Throat Cancer Foundation has endorsed the manual and       provides support for this       approach to be adopted in Cancer Units.
