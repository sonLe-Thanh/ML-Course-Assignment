     Practitioner empathy involves an ability to understand the patient's       situation, perspective and feelings, the capability to communicate and       confirm this with the patient, and subsequently apply this understanding       in a therapeutic manner.
Before 2000 there were no validated measures to       assess empathy that were suitable for use in routine healthcare across a       range of settings.
Research at University of Glasgow has developed the       first validated patient-rated questionnaire in a primary care setting that       measures patient perceptions of healthcare professionals' empathy and       quality of care for general practice.
The CARE Measure is freely available to download from the University of       Glasgow website.a The image to the right illustrates the       questions involved in the measure.
Since 2004, the CARE Measure has formed       an integral component of professional bodies and government initiatives       (details of which are provided below):            RCGP professional training standards, to facilitate assessment,         appraisal and revalidation       Scottish Government policy on Healthcare Quality       Chartered Society of Physiotherapy patient experience reporting      	   	   	       In addition, funding was provided by the Scottish Government to establish       a website in 2012 as part of the validation work in Allied Health       Professionals, led by Duncan in collaboration with Mercer.b       This website facilitates the collection and use of CARE Measure data from       medical, Nursing and Allied Health Professional practitioners, allowing       registered users to compare their data with that of their peers, to       identify any potential areas of improvement.
Between going live in       September 2012 and 31st July 2013, there were 1180 registered       users, primarily doctors.c     Incorporation of the CARE Measure in RCGP professional training           standards to facilitate assessment, appraisal and revalidation     The MRCGP exam is a compulsory assessment system that complies with the       standards set by the UK's GMC.
It confirms a doctor's competence in the       speciality of General Practice and ability to practice independently in       the UK.
Completion of the MRCGP is a pre-requisite for the certificate of       completion of training (CCT) and full RCGP membership.
Since August 2007,       the CARE Measure (renamed Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ) by the       RCGPd) has been used as a compulsory evidence-based tool in the       Workplace-Based Assessment component of the MRCGP Exame.
In       this capacity, the PSQ allows patient feedback to be gathered on empathy       and relationship-building with each GP trainee.
Two cycles of the PSQ are       used during the training period: once in GP placement in Speciality       Training year 1 or year 2 and once in Speciality Training year 3.e       The RCGP estimates that with approximately 3,000 GP trainees each year, an       average of 33,000 cycles of PSQ were completed by trainees between 1st       Jan 2008 and 31st July 2013.e The decision by RCGP       to adopt the CARE Measure was based on its proven ability to effectively       discriminate between doctors [references 3 and 4, above].
iMAP is the process whereby independent practitioners on the GP register       may become members of the RCGP.
Assessment for membership on this basis       requires the completion of fifteen compulsory modules, one of which       specifically addresses the PSQ.
The PSQ was initially the only tool to       facilitate this when iMAP was launched in 2007.f It is now one       of seven tools approved; encouraging its uptake, it is the only tool       available free of charge.g The RCGP estimates that since 2007,       approximately 30% of applicants to iMAP used the PSQ.f The       decision by RCGP to adopt the CARE Measure was based on its proven ability       to effectively discriminate between doctors [references 3 and 4, above].
Revalidation is the process by which all 60,000 licensed doctors must       demonstrate to the GMC that they are up to date and fit to practice; this       ensures compliance with the relevant professional standards, and is thus       compulsory to maintain a license to practice.
To determine its suitability       for use in revalidation, the CARE Measure has twice been comprehensively       reviewed by the RCGP; in 2009 it was one of nine patient feedback tools       reviewed,h and in 2010 it was one of ten reviewed.h       Subsequently, the CARE Measure has been fully endorsed by RCGP as a `fit       for purpose' patient survey for use in the revalidation process.h,i       The CARE Measure is used by GPs in Scotland as both a patient satisfaction       survey and for appraisal and revalidation; it is listed in the Scottish       Online Appraisal Resource (the key online information point for GP       Appraisal).j,k Since 2004, it has been accredited for use in       appraisal of all GPs in Scotland.l The decision by the GMC to       adopt the CARE Measure was based on its proven ability to effectively       discriminate between doctors [references 3-6, above].
Implementation of the CARE Measure into government policy     In Scotland, the CARE Measure is detailed in the Government's Quality       Strategy (2010).m The Quality Strategy aims to allow those       involved in Scotland's healthcare &#8212; namely all healthcare professionals       (numbering 100,000), partners and the public &#8212; to work towards achieving       three Quality Ambitions of Safe, Person-Centred and Effective healthcare.
The Quality Strategy specifies the use of the CARE Measure as a tool to       capture patients' assessments of their relationships with healthcare       professionals, allowing an understanding of health outcomes and patient       experience to be determined, and for improvement to be informed where       required.m Inclusion of the CARE Measure has made Scotland the       first country in the world to include staff empathy as a component of       healthcare quality.
The decision by the Government to adopt the CARE       Measure was based on its proven ability to effectively discriminate       between practitioners [references 3-6, above], and by a series of       high-level meetings and discussion between Mercer and the Scottish       Government between 2009-2010, including the Chief Executive of NHS       Scotland at the time (Dr Derek Feeley) and the then Cabinet Secretary and       Minister for Health, Nicola Sturgeon.
Implementation of the CARE Measure as a validated Patient           Reported Experience Measure     Since 2012, the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy has recommended the       CARE Measure to their 52,000 members (98% of UK physiotherapists).n       In this context, the CARE Measure is being used by the Chartered Society       of Physiotherapy as the primary validated Patient Reported Experience       Measure, to assess and improve Physiotherapy services along with the       overall patient journey.n The CARE Measure became a       recommendation after a 2009 Scottish pilot study (collaboration between       University of Glasgow and University of Stirling) associated with       Physiotherapy training and person centred care, which subsequently led to       involvement in validation work in Allied Health Professionals.
