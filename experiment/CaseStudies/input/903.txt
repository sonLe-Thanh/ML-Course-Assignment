     Context     Prior to the KTP, which completed in January 2010, CGI International Ltd       was a commodity product manufacturer and supplier, operating without an       R&amp;D function with product improvements achieved empirically by       tweaking the manufacturing process on a "trial and error" basis [A].
It       was this lack of technical capability combined with external pressures and       trends, in particular more stringent European fire standards, competition       from toughened glass products, a sales plateau in The Netherlands and       market demands for larger sizes of flame resistant (FR) glass, that led to       CGI undertaking the KTP with the University of Leeds [B].
Research at the       University of Leeds into the fire performance of glass laminates with       resin interlayers provided CGI with the ability to model and accurately       predict the performance of its Pyroguard product in full-scale fire tests       using data from the cone calorimeter.
The KTP project achieved the highest       grade of `Outstanding' and was shortlisted along with seven others (out of       approximately 800 KTP projects) for the Best Partnership Award 2012 [C,       D].
Impact     The commercial adoption by CGI of this new technical knowledge had a wide       range of significant impacts on the Company, and also benefited users of       its products.
Impact on CGI     During the eligible period CGI has:     &#8212; Developed and launched three new high performance products     &#8212; Generated &#163;5m of new business in a shrinking market thereby       increasing market share     &#8212; Reduced product development time by 50% and fire test costs by       &#163;20,000 pa     &#8212; Created a new R&amp;D function, recruiting 4 staff and investing       &#163;120,000 in equipment     &#8212; Moved from being a commodity manufacturer to a technically-led solution       provider     Development and commercialisation of new products       Formulation improvements to the resin interlayer have been incorporated in       all products manufactured in-house by CGI.
This includes three new premium       Pyroguard products with improved fire and impact performance (EW 30       Impact, Maxi 30 and FD 60).
EW 30 Impact was launched in September 2012       and represented the most significant innovative step, it being "the         first cut-to-size FR product in the market to achieve a 2B2 impact         rating at 7mm (pane thickness)".
[B]     Increased sales and market share in a shrinking market       CGI has derived significant commercial benefit from these new products at       the same time as the construction market, to which the performance of the       FR glazing market is tied, has shrunk by 18.9% since the first quarter of       2008.
[E] The addition of &#163;5m of new business from sales of EW 30 Impact       means that in effect CGI has increased its market share [B].
The higher       margin premium products have increased the Company's profitability.
Reduction in development costs and shorter time-to-market       Accurate prediction of fire performance has enabled CGI to significantly       reduce fire test costs, estimated at &#163;20,000 pa, and shorten product       development time by approximately 50%.
[B]     Creation and resourcing of a brand new R&amp;D function       In January 2010 CGI established a new R&amp;D function, employing Dr Crook       (the KTP associate) as Head of R&amp;D and followed this with the       recruitment of three additional staff.
Investment in equipment, including       a cone calorimeter, and facilities over the eligible period totalled       &#163;120,000.
"Having an R&amp;D capability enables us to get closer to         the market, identify trends and capture customer needs to ensure that we         continue to innovate."
[B].
CGI has invested in two more KTPs with       Leeds during the eligible period [B, D].
The topics of these were process       improvement and the development of new product to replace the third party       product representing 15% (and growing) of CGI sales.
Implementation of the       results of the first of these KTPs, which completed in March 2012, are at       planning stage; the second, finishing in March 2013, has resulted in a new       product specification that CGI will manufacture at its newly acquired       French manufacturing facility.
[B]     Fundamental change in culture and strategic direction       According to CGI, as a result of the KTP: "A fundamental change in         company culture has occurred, from a commodity manufacturer and supplier         to a technically-led provider of innovative solutions for fire         engineering problems in the construction industry."
[A]     Impact on users       The innovations underpinned by research from Leeds have also had an impact       on CGI's customer base of glazing installation companies.
The availability       of an EW 30 product with a 2B2 rating at 7mm as opposed to 11mm thickness       means that installers can cut-to-size on site.
"At 7mm thick we are         able to process and cut Pyroguard ourselves, which saves a significant         amount of time when fulfilling orders against short lead times."
[F]     Sustainable impact       Leeds' research is applicable in other thermally reactive fire protection       systems such as intumescent paints for the protection of steel structures       and industrial plant.
