     There are two main impacts arising from this body of research.
Firstly,       it has influenced the training of LIS practitioners internationally in       relation to how to engage in user research within LIS.
Secondly, it has       helped learners and pupils in secondary schools dealing with complex       information environments to change how they access, assess and interact       with web-based information.
It has also assisted educators in UK secondary       school to understand better these behaviours and thus to be better       informed about how to support users.
Impact on training LIS practitioners: The book "         Research methods in information" by Pickard was a major output from       the work on research methodology explained in Section 2.
It was the first       "handbook" of research methods developed specifically for LIS and was a       Facet best-seller in 2008, with two print runs totalling over 10,000       copies sold.
Now in its second edition (2013) it has also been translated       into Italian (Source 1).
The book is being used as a core LIS text in over       24 countries by educators and their students who are studying to be       practitioners, and as a tool by established LIS practitioners       internationally who engage in user/LIS research, and has been adopted in       other disciplines such as computing, journalism and communication.
"Pickard's         even-handed approach provides a safe haven for exploration and thinking.
Regardless of a student's orientation, the text tours diverse approaches         and promotes thinking about research.
The handbook also emboldens         faculty who wish to provide creative options for students, in lieu of         steering them toward a predetermined path" (Source 2).
LIS students       have identified specific impact of the book on their work: "particularly         for students on University College Dublin's MLIS programme undertaking         Assignment 1 (Evaluation of published LIS research).
If I had to choose         between Creswell and Pickard, I would choose Pickard because it has a         better logical flow, contains information not in Creswell... and overall         has better detail...Creswell's description seems out of date (or         immature) compared to Pickard's" (Source 3).
More recent impact has       come from a new chapter in the second edition which has: "had a         successful and measurable impact on our Simmons College [USA] students'         successful grades/marks on the qualitative case analyses that they were         assigned last month" -"the students really found your materials         helpful and I know our librarian community here will as well"       (Source 3)     Impact on user behaviour of learners/pupils and educators:       Output from the JUBILEE project, in the form of an online toolkit, was       made openly available via the JISC InfoNET infrastructure.
In her review       of the project for JISC, Professor Jenny Rowley considered that the       JUBILEE toolkit was: "far more ambitious and sophisticated than any         work attempted elsewhere...
The EIS [Electronic Information Systems]         maturity tool-kit offers a valuable tool for HE managers" (Source       4).
School Learning Resource centres responded swiftly to the findings of       the AHRC PhD study (Pickard) and CPD training on the introduction and       delivery of online information services was developed and delivered to       school librarians across the country.
The findings of the CETL-funded       research have produced a model for information literacy mentoring which       continues to be used and is being developed in secondary schools       nationally.
The iTrust research (2010) received a similarly favourable review: "The         results were extremely interesting...
The report deserves wider         dissemination than normal LIS channels as there are implications for all         stages of education" (Source 5).
The iTrust model developed from the       research has been used as the basis for developing a new approach to       digital awareness involving personal models of information evaluation       which has application within the education sector and more generally to       all citizens.
The model, and the understanding it brings of user       behaviour, has been used by Pickard to deliver CPD training to Public       Library staff in the region (15 Senior Library and Information Officers       (LIO) and over 40 LIO's, 2008-09) in preparation for the national Go ON UK       Project.
This involved preparing library staff for new ways of working       including the delivery of training to "silver surfers", young people and       the unemployed to make use of online services; developing collaborative       ways of working and understanding community cohesion.
Anne Turnbull,       Trainee Library and Information Officer, Newcastle Libraries, said of the       CPD: "ICM staff designed a brilliant, hands-on programme which         covered topics from Web 2.0, community engagement, presentation and         management skills to reader development... the most valued and practical         lesson that we all took away from the programme was the importance of         reflective practice and the opportunity to share good practice and learn         from more challenging situations... as a team, we've gone from being         localised and out of touch to being leaders, innovators and         opportunists!"
(Source 6).
This training led to a request to carry       out research on behalf of housing associations to discover the extent of       residents' online information literacy in preparation for Government plans       to digitise the entire state benefit system.
Based on our most recent investigation into the evaluation practices of       Key Stage 4 and 5 pupils (13-16 years) Pickard and Shenton have developed       a framework to assist in improving the evaluation and critical thinking       skills of young learners in their information interactions on the web.
Our       Evaluation Framework tool for meta-evaluation of web-based resources for       secondary education has now been published in "Creative Teaching and         Learning" (V3 (2), 2012, pp22-28) and on the British Computer       Society Digital Literacy for Life programme website (Reports and thought       leadership, http://dlfl.bcs.org/category/17628),       extending the work beyond LIS and into IT and teacher education.
A request       from a teacher led to the framework being tested with 6th form pupils       preparing research case studies for the A-Level awards (Source 7).
Evidence from this case study suggests that use of the Framework       significantly increased levels of self-efficacy in the use of digital       resources and increased awareness of the evaluation process.
Evidence of       assimilation of knowledge, accommodation and transference were noted when       the intervention was applied across other subjects.
One pupil said that       the framework had been: "just as useful in my history coursework as it         has been here, I feel like I'm more in control now".
Another claimed       that: "I used it all of the time, now I'm doing this stuff...         evaluating, without always thinking" (Source 8).
As a result of this       research Pickard and Shenton submitted a proposal to the UK Literacy       Association to write a minibook for their series about the Evaluation       Framework and practical approaches to its use within the classroom.
The       UKLA responded very positively inviting them to contribute, saying: "there         is an urgent need for more information on how to support children and         young people in assessing the value and relevance of the information         they are accessing from a variety of sources.
This issue is becoming         particularly more pressing of course, the further we enter into the         internet age, as young people have exposure to so much information in         electronic and digital forms" and " felt [they] have an         important contribution to make within the context of this minibook         series" (Source 9).
There has been significant interest nationally       and internationally in using the Framework in Secondary and Higher       Education (Source 10).
All of this research contributed to the preparation of a successful       collaborative EU Tempus programme bid in 2012, which supports the       modernisation of HE in partner countries in Europe and Central Asia.
The       &#163;700,000 "IMPRESS" project is concerned with knowledge transfer across       Ukrainian universities, focusing on digital literacy and other related       skills and aiming to provide a framework for the Ukrainian Ministry of       Education across their national HE sector.
Northumbria University is the       lead partner (Strachan and Pickard, 2012-15).
