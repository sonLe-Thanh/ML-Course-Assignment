     The research described above convinced UK government departments to       invest in multiple editions of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) and       the Health Poverty Index (HPI).
These have had considerable impact:     [1] changing where the government (national and local) allocates funding       &#8212; leading to investment in areas of genuine need,     [2] being the main point of reference for parliamentary debates on the       geographical distribution of deprivation across the UK &#8212; impacting policy       in UK,     [3] used extensively in the media in articles about geographical       inequalities across the UK &#8212; and therefore have influenced the public       understanding of patterns of need,     [4] as a way children are taught about patterns of `need',     [5] has been adopted by a number of countries across the world.
The IMD "have had a huge impact in terms of both reach and         significance.
The impact has been so great that it is almost hard to         remember what life was like before they existed ..the SIMD [IMD in         Scotland] are certainly the standard which are extremely widely used by         a very wide range of users....
The benefits of this have been huge."
(Senior manager, National Records of Scotland) [S1].
(1) In resource allocation and policy decision making across the UK     "The Indices of Multiple Deprivation and its component indices are         probably the main mechanisms used in government at the moment to         distinguish between small areas for the purposes of analysing area         change, monitoring performance, setting targets and allocating funding."
[S6]     "The Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) are used extensively to         analyse patterns of deprivation and inform the identification of areas         by local and central government that would benefit from special         initiatives or programmes and as a tool to determine eligibility for         specific funding."
[S7]     About 1% of all government spending per year is allocated using       the IMD - ~&#163; 7 billion per year (author's calculation).
The IMD       when first used led to considerable change in where resources were being       allocated across the UK, in particular it saw resources moving from some       parts of London to deprived parts of the North East and North West of       England (The Association of London Government calculated this change at       &#163;265 million leaving London per year).
The fact that the IMD is accepted       as an accurate measure of need, despite these large changes in where       funding was allocated, is strong evidence that it is redirecting resources       to areas of real need.
The IMD is also used extensively in local government [S2-S5].
For example       for Falkirk Council, it "is of major significance to us.
We use         it to target resources, e.g.
young people who would be eligible for         employment training programmes.
We use it to identify areas of need.
It         has on occasion been a factor in defining service delivery areas to         ensure that our areas of deprivation are not concentrated in one         particular service delivery area" (Senior manage Falkirk Council).
[S5]     The Improvement and Development Agency argue that the HPI is a "web         based tool covering all local authority districts in England... Rather         than being a tool for monitoring inequalities and evaluating the         effectiveness of interventions, [it is] an essential summary at the         start of the decision-making process as part of assessing needs and         facilitating discussion within local partnerships on local priorities."
[S8]     (2) In the way politicians discuss the geographical patterns of `need'         across the UK            The IMD has consistently been central to debates at a national level &#8212;         a search of Hansard reveals 402 occasions in the last 10         years when it has been part of debates or parliamentary questions &#8212; this         level of reference has been consistent in the period since 2008.
It is used in evidence for select committees, e.g.
House of Commons         2011 Communities and Local Government Committee Regeneration, 2011 the         House of Lords Select Committee on HIV and AIDS in the United Kingdom.
[S9]          James Wharton MP, for example, when questioning civil servants during the       Public Accounts Committee 2010 review of health inequalities uses       statistics based on the IMD to "find that 52% of the deprived areas are         not within the Spearheaded areas, so it seems not only that where we are         or have been targeting we have picked up some areas that are perhaps not         in as desperate a need as others, but then you are missing out a huge         chunk of deprived areas which could benefit from this."
[S10]     The IMD is a tool for political accountability.
David Walker (former         director of communications at the Audit Commission) writes that the       public should "laud a decision to go ahead with the publication of the         latest IMD figures &#8212; because they redirect           attention to the huge disparity of resources and social conditions           between England's local areas....Rich boroughs might,         privately, aspire to get rid of their poor residents, and housing         benefit changes may help achieve that.
But the IMD shows councils         cannot, for the foreseeable future, escape their fate as instruments of         social justice."
[S11].
(3) In the way journalists describe geographical patterns of `need'         across the UK            A search of the BBC website reveals its use in 131         articles referencing it and on the Guardian website 61 times         in the last ten years.
A search using Google reveals 1,000+ references to it on local         government reports, websites, newspaper articles etc.
Of these 1,000,         about 500 were referenced in published books, reports.
For example an article in the Guardian, 14 November 2012 "Analysis         of the data by the Guardian reveals that in the 50 worst councils         affected by the government's decision to slash local authority budgets         from 2010, the average cut was &#163;160 per head.
This group included the         poorest populations in Britain &#8212; such as the most deprived council in         the country, Hackney, and struggling urban areas of the north such as         Liverpool, Rochdale and South Tyneside."
[S12] is typical of the way       debate and discussion is framed using the IMD.
(4) As a way children are taught about patterns of `need' across the         UK     The IMD is used in A level geography teaching.
For example, the IMD is       part of the Edexcel AS geography syllabus.
Edexcel, one of the five main       UK exam boards, uses it to enable children to explore the theme of places       needing to `rebrand themselves' Field Studies Council).
Therefore       impacting how children understand the world around them.
(5) The IMD and Health Poverty Index methodology is now being adopted         by other countries around the world            A number of versions have been produced for the Department for Social         Development in South Africa 2010 [3].
The IMD methodology has also been adopted by Namibia and Oman.
The             Health Poverty Index methodology was adopted by the Irish         Public health Observatory in 2008.
