     Professor Herbert's research has decisively influenced professional and       amateur musicians, the heritage industry, and print and broadcast media       around the world.
It has provided a more sophisticated and nuanced       understanding of the conventions of historical performance of brass       instruments than previously existed, and that knowledge continues to       inspire new forms of artistic expression in modern performance.
Herbert's long and distinguished career as a performer at the highest       level of the music profession has provided him with an intimacy with the       practical problems that performers face in interpreting musical texts and       a familiarity with many of the world's leading players and ensembles.
A       great deal of the advice he provides is to individual performers: for       example, he has advised members of the Welsh National Opera, the Royal       Opera House and Glyndebourne Opera on the instruments that should be used       for the performance of nineteenth-century Italian opera &#8212; particularly the       type of instruments that should be used: valve or slide instruments; wide       or narrow bore instruments and the type of instrument that should be       properly deployed for the bass parts labelled `cimbasso'.
He has also       advised museums, including the National Museum of Wales, on the provenance       and description of instruments.
His advice is seen as important because it       is known to be based on a forensic examination of a wide range of primary       sources [5.10].
The depth of influence on the international music community of Professor       Herbert's portfolio of research and its relevance to musical practice is       perhaps best demonstrated in the continued success of Music in Words:         A Guide to Researching and Writing About Music.
This was       commissioned by the ABRSM (the world's largest music performance examining       body) and first published in 2001.
It is the default text for teachers of       music performance and performance students, and is aimed at creating a       strong synergy between research method and musical practice.
Published in two editions (2001 and 2012) with associated websites, Music         in Words has been reprinted six times with 14,429 copies sold in       Europe and Commonwealth countries.
In 2010 it was adapted to American       style and published in the USA by Oxford University Press (US sales data       not available).
Music in Words is praised by industry experts as       `the standard reference work for all serious writers about music' (The         Trombonist), `an accessible and thorough source of guidance' (Ensemble),       and `an invaluable reference tool' (The Strad) [5.1, 5.2).
Herbert's research has also contributed significantly to the most widely       consulted reference sources in the world, which are commonly used as the       initial reference points not just for academics but for the creative       industries globally.
These include Oxford Bibliographies Online       (2011), The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales (2008), the New         Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (continuously updated since       2000), American Grove and the New Grove Dictionary of Musical         Instruments (both 2012).
Research findings have directly informed       these publications, replacing longer established major entries with       entirely new explanations of many of the fundamental search terms relating       to brass instruments.
From 2010 to 2013, annual hits on these brass       instrument entries in Grove Music Online exceed 3000.
Beyond the international music community, TV and radio programmes,       commercial DVDs and heritage exhibitions have introduced Herbert's       research to a wider public audience.
These include major roles in radio       series such as the American Public Radio Network Programme British         Brass Bands: A Working class Tradition (2013) and the documentary       DVD History of Brass Bands: The Golden Period (2011).
Permanent exhibitions for which Herbert has provided the explanatory       texts and expert advice include the popular music culture exhibit at the       National Waterfront Museum of Wales and the permanent exhibition at the       Cyfarthfa Castle Museum, which typically attracts 70k-75k visitors each       year (72,686 in 2012).
This exhibit tells the story of the Cyfarthfa Band       through a sequence of explanatory captions relating to instruments, music       manuscripts, pictures and ephemera.
It has in turn been the focus for       several TV and radio programmes, including The People's Museum       (BBC2, 2008).
