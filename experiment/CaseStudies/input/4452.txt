     Macrory's research has led directly to new laws, regulations and a new       Environment Tribunal.
Legislative change: The Government accepted the core       recommendations in Macrory's 2006 Report [c], and legislated in the Regulatory         Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008 [1] for fixed monetary penalties       and discretionary requirements including:            variable monetary penalties;       compliance notices;       restoration notices;       variable monetary penalties with voluntary undertakings;       stop notices;       enforcement undertakings.
The published guidance to the Act explicitly refers to the Macrory Report       and the fact that the Act directly implements Macrory's recommendations       [2, pp.6, 17, 28, 43].
Creation of a new Environment Tribunal: Macrory's 2003 Report [a]       was the first to advocate a specific model for an environmental tribunal,       and it has been extensively referred to in discussions and literature       since then.
His 2006 Report [c] then advocated a regulatory appeals       tribunal where civil sanctions were introduced.
Following the introduction of sanctions in the environmental field in         2010, the First Tier (Environment) Tribunal was set up in line with         Macrory's recommendations and was the first such specialist         environmental court of its kind in the United Kingdom.
[17]       The core recommendations of Macrory's 2011 Report [d] &#8212; that more         environmental appeals be transferred to the Tribunal and that there be a         more coherent approach &#8212; have also been accepted in principle by the UK         Government.
[15]       Many more environmental appeals have now been transferred to the         Tribunal, including nitrate and emissions trading in 2012, the first         appeal was handled by the new tribunal in 2012 and proposals to transfer         further appeals were announced in 2013.
[15]          Defra Legal Advisor, explained that "Before Macrory wrote Consistency         and Effectiveness [d] few here had had the opportunity to step         back and consider the most effective way to use the First Tier         (Environment) Tribunal for environmental appeals.
The work prompted us         to consider the issue in the round, and has influenced thinking in         government.
As and when the opportunity arises, appeals are being         transferred if appropriate to the new tribunal in line with Macrory's         recommendation" [15].
Creating a civil sanctions regime for environmental offences: For       a range of environmental offences committed after 2009, the UK       Environmental Agency has acquired civil sanction powers in Part III of the       Regulatory Enforcement &amp; Sanctions Act 2008 [2], the legislation       implementing Macrory's recommendations [b, c].
In its most recent       published Enforcement and Sanctions Policy (4/1/2011) the Agency states       that "when considering the appropriate course of action to address         offending and to ensure compliance, we aim to follow the penalty         principles set out in the Macrory Review" [3, p. 4].
In 2011, a       proposal by Oliver Letwin, Minister of State at the Cabinet Office, to       scrap the civil sanctions regime sparked debate amongst legal and       environmental professionals [17].
The Minister's main concern was the       possible impact on small businesses [11].
Opposition from Letwin and       others led to a cross-government review.
This decided to keep the       sanctions regime recommended by Macrory in place: in future civil       sanctions would generally only be available in respect of companies with       250 plus employees, but offender Enforceable Undertakings (EUs) would be       available for everyone [18].
Impact on industry, NGOs and communities: The impact of civil       sanctions on industry, non- governmental organisations (NGOs) and       communities has been direct and far-reaching:            The Environment Agency reports that, in the period from January 2012 &#8212;         July 2013, 67 offender Enforcement Undertakings (EUs) were accepted by         the Agency [4].
Under previous regimes, these industries would have been prosecuted         even where no intention to breach regulations was involved.
The         significance for industry now is that no formal admission of criminal         guilt is required (which can be a crucial factor for industry in terms         of reputation and insurability).
The Agency reports that approximately a third of breaches of         regulations are now self-reported by industry.
Compliant industries         appreciate that no competitive gain is made since any economic gains         made by non-compliance, even inadvertently, are taken away in the form         of donations to third party charities.
The EUs also benefit charities and local communities.
Over &#163;500,000         has been donated to charities under EUs since January 2012.
This         includes large groups such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), but also         many local environmental groups such as Cheshire Wildlife Trust and         Young People's Trust for the Environment.
Sums range from hundreds to         tens of thousands of pounds, and for some smaller charities these are         substantial and crucial to their survival [4,5].
Impact beyond the environment field: As an indication of the reach       of the impact of Macrory's work in this area, the terms Macrory           principles and Macrory characteristics have       become embedded in much of the contemporary institutional language of       regulatory sanctions, and are used by other regulatory institutions such       as the Food Standards Agency [6], Office of Fair Trading [7, 1.2, 2.8],       Office of Water Regulation [8 pp.1, 3, 4, 10] and Civil Aviation Authority       [9, Annex C, para.
3, 5, 11].
The National Audit Office, for instance,       states that "The purpose of this programme of `Hampton Implementation         Reviews' is to provide regulators with a structured check on performance         against the Hampton principles and the Macrory characteristics."
[10, p.1]     Impact beyond England and Wales: While the 2006 Macrory Report       and proposals were focused on England and Wales, many of the underlying       principles and ideas have influenced policy development in other parts of       the UK where devolved governments have been considering the introduction       of civil sanctions.
The Scottish Executive's 2012 Consultation         Document on Integrated Framework for Environmental Regulation relies       on the Macrory Report in its proposals for enforcement.
It proposes to       create "a range of flexible and proportionate enforcement options for         SEPA [Scottish Environmental Protection Agency]" and supported this       recommendation by stating that Macrory's "research suggests that a         flexible, proportionate, risk-based approach which utilises a range of         direct measures by SEPA is the most effective way of enforcing         legislation" [12 at 3.5.3].
In August 2012 Professor Macrory led a       special seminar on policy development for SEPA and senior Scottish       government officials.
The Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Bill, introduced to       the Scottish Parliament on 27 March 2013, proposes a new integrated       regulatory framework and a broader range of enforcement based on the       Macrory approach [19].
Similarly in Northern Ireland (NI), the Department of the Environment       published a White Paper in 2011, Environmental Better Regulation,       proposing new administrative penalties and a reform of criminal sanctions.
It concluded, "The proposed changes are also in keeping with the         Hampton recommendations on risk-based inspection and the Macrory         review's recommendations on flexible penalties" [13 p. 23].
In 2012       Professor Macrory was invited to discuss his proposals with the Minister       for the Environment and key legal officials in Northern Ireland.
In 2013       the NI Department of the Environment announced Government proposals for       new Environmental Offences primary legislation that will include the       introduction of administrative penalties [14 at para.
90].
In 2011       Professor Macrory was also invited by the Israeli Ministry of Justice to       lead on his report [c] at a seminar to discuss developing a system of       administrative penalties for business regulation in Israel.
The Ministry's       Senior Director of Criminal Law explained the influence of the Macrory       Report saying: "For many of the legal arrangements reached by us we         relied on your report, which served as an important basic document for         these arrangements" [16].
