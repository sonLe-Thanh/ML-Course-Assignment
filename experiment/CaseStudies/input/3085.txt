     The University of Nottingham Institute for Enterprise and Innovation       (UNIEI) within the Business School has worked closely with the       Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council BBSRC) since 1995       to manage and deliver Biotechnology YES.
In response to the challenge of       growing the scheme, Simon Mosey and Tracey Hassall Jones (UNIEI) worked       with Simon Cutler (Senior Innovation and Skills Manager, BBSRC) to develop       and deliver the Biotechnology YES growth plan in 2005 that introduced       content and pedagogical additions based upon UNIEI research.
This allowed       for the scheme to grow and yet retain the rich learning experience enjoyed       through small cohorts.
The scheme pioneered the use of opportunity       identification training [2], introduced peer reviewed investment pitches       for all participants [6] and provided interaction on a large scale with       industrialists and equity financiers as mentors and judges across the       whole cohort [3, 4].
As a result, participation in the scheme grew from under 200 in 2005 to       more than 400 in 2011.
In total, more than 2500 academic researchers took       part between 2005 and 2011 [A, page 7].
Expansion into other academic       disciplines ensued with a variant for environmental scientists initiated       in 2006 (with the Natural Environment Research Council) and two further       schemes launched in 2009 to bring this unique delivery model to the       engineering and sustainability research communities (with the Engineering       and Physical Sciences Research Council).
This growth was further accelerated through wider (industry)       partnerships: a bespoke competition was held for microbial and plant       scientists at Syngenta's Jealotts Hill research site in 2011 [A, page 12].
Similarly, a competition for biomedical scientists was launched at       GlaxoSmithKline's Bio incubator in Stevenage in 2012, together with the       Medical Research Council and Wellcome Trust.
The CEO of the Bio incubator       explained the added value hosting the competition on industrial sites:     "I've seen many times the value and benefit young entrepreneurs can         derive from being exposed to an incubator and seeing for themselves what         can be achieved away from academic research.
It is a highly networked         atmosphere they are not traditionally exposed to early in their careers         &#8212; a space where early start-ups develop and grow.
It's a whole new world         which provides a real-life focus."
Martino Picardo, CEO of GSK Bio Incubator, 2012 [B, page 2]     This continued expansion has been highly endorsed by the UK Government:     `I would like to congratulate all the participants of the         Biotechnology and Environment YES competitions on their success.
Scientists who are able to combine their expertise with an understanding         of business are a very precious resource.
By learning how to translate         research into wider successes, they can help ensure their work delivers         the maximum benefits to society and the economy.
I am impressed that the         participants are taking the opportunity to develop their skills and         knowledge at this early stage of their careers &#8212; it suggests a bright         future for the commercialisation of UK research.'
David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science, 2011 [A, page         1]     In 2010, an independent review of the scheme, commissioned by the BBSRC       reported [C] that:     i.
Biotechnology YES participants were found to develop a different set       of skills than those developed through taking a PhD.
Specifically       commercialisation knowledge, financial awareness and the ability to       communicate in a commercial setting were all increased as illustrated       below:        ii.
Biotechnology YES was found to have a significant impact upon the       career aspirations of participants by developing a greater awareness of       employment opportunities outside academia and enhancing the propensity to       set up their own business.
iii.
A higher proportion of participants were employed within industry       than those researchers that did not participate.
iv.
Biotechnology YES had a strong fit with entrepreneurship and       innovation policy regionally, nationally and internationally.
The evaluation also found that case studies of former participants       highlighted substantial impact from business start-ups or enhanced careers       attributed partly to YES.
These ranged from salary uplifts of up to 25%       and 5-60% of business success being attributed to YES.
The financial       benefits ranged from &#163;5k p.a.
of self-employed turnover to &#163;200k of       investment funding and, from one business alone, potential licensing       income of &#163;3M.
[C, page 62]     From the participant feedback on completion of the programme, a common       consensus emerged regarding their view of skills developed as a result of       participation.
They stated that they developed skills in financial       awareness, team working, management, verbal communication, and time       management within a commercial context [C].
For example:     "I thought the YES experience was excellent.
Perhaps my opinion of the         course is slightly biased because our team performed well in the         competition, but I have taken many varied skills away from the course.
The commercial aspect of science is still one that is poorly understood         within my faculty and this course gives a great insight into the         business world for an emerging scientist/manager/entrepreneur."
Participant, 2009 [C, page 37]     Resources invested by the scheme partners (research councils, industry       and regional development agency) have demonstrated a deep, ongoing       commitment to YES and realisation of the value of the scheme.
Between 2008       and 2012, a total of &#163;938 000 was committed by these partners and       sponsors, both in terms of cash and staff time, recognising the benefits       they saw in nurturing creating academic researchers with the skills to       identify new commercial opportunities and exploit these fully:     "Biotechnology YES offers research scientists opportunities outside of         academia and shows them the skills needed to move their science forward,         including marketing, finance, IP etc."
Regional Development Agency         Representative [C, page 28]     Finally, the knowledge generated from managing this growth has been       widely shared with a range of policy-makers and key sector organisations.
Martin Binks and Simon Mosey have communicated the pedagogical       implications through presentations, workshops and publications to       institutions such as Science in Parliament, the Institute of Directors,       the Design Council, the NHS and the Royal Academy of Engineering [D].
