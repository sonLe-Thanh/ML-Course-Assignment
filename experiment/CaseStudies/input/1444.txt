     The primary beneficiaries of the research were participants in and       audiences of the 3RO performance.
Extensive touring, inclusion in       theatre festivals, the development of an accompanying installation in       2011, and up to eight performances a day allowed the project to reach a       significant audience, without compromising the research-led decision to       keep each audience small: 12 spectators per performance.
The performance toured the UK in May-July 2010, travelling to five       locations: Norwich, Cambridge, Ipswich, Newcastle and London (89       performances, attendance 1394; participants in workshops and discussions       334).
The receipt of additional funding to further develop the project       from organisations including the National Theatre Studio and the Arts       Council (itself indicative of the theatre sector's perception of the       project's significance) enabled it to be presented in 2011 at the Watford       Imagine Festival and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival (80 performances,       attendance 680; additional participants in the `strategy' cell 395).
Audiences included theatre professionals, the general public and school       children at St Bede's secondary school, Cambridge; Flegg High School,       Norfolk; and New Vic College, London.
Both the creation of the performance and the subsequent performances       involved participation by the public.
Impact on participants/audiences'       cultural life was direct, enriching their imaginations and         sensibilities and improving public discourse around issues       of climate-change and their capacity to address the issue.
Evaluations       also showed wider education benefits in schools.
Svendsen has       presented the research in the context of sustainability policy development       including Suffolk Coast Futures and the Cambridge University Centre for       Science and Policy; and in the context of arts development including the       University of East Anglia, Norwich Arts and Business.
The research was       presented at the Association of Performing Arts Presenters 2013, a New       York annual conference for theatre producers, at which a UK panel       presented a selection of European projects addressing climate change as       examples of best practice.
The British Council provided funding and       administrative support to share the findings of the project with artists       and producers in Berlin, and to travel to Beijing and Shanghai to discuss       the project with artists, producers and environmental NGOs and journalists       in 2010 and 2011.
[1]     3RO has had an impact on cultural life, as witnessed by audience       figures for live performances (see above) and visitors to the web-site       (peaking at 700 per day in June 2010).
It has been well received within       the sector: Fascinating and chilling show &#8212; the real power lay in the         accumulation of very convincing detail and the brilliant multimedia         layering up of it.
[2]     It is this ability to engage and provoke that was of particular benefit:     Third Ring Out stands out for me as high point of the year, and not         just the theatrical year!
It was a really engaging, stimulating         immersion in a possible future world; so fast-moving and requiring all         faculties to be constantly engaged that it was a real shock at the end         to discover how long we had been immersed in the operations room,         focussed on saving Newcastle!
I would highly recommend it to any town or         city wanting to engage its citizens in some real thinking about their         role in planning for a climate change future.
[3]     It has been compared favourably with other performances:     The play was engaging, and was also effective in provoking questions         and reactions from the audience about effective strategies for coping         with the effects of climate change.
By involving the audience in         decisions, it avoided the overly descriptive accounts of climate science         or policy that have characterised other more traditional theatrical         engagements with climate change; and its hyper-local focus, with the         outside world shut out but brought inside in the form of a familiar         local map, suggested the local, not just global, nature of the problem.
[4]     Similarly the performance received positive reviews from audiences, again       because it improved understanding and provoked thought about difficult       issues:     Brilliantly conceived.
I couldn't recommend this highly enough &#8212; it         was thought provoking and serious.
[and]       This performance gave excellent insight into our future and caused the         audience to dwell, and even act on, the thoughts it provoked.
This         performance has the power to change cultures' ways of thinking...         intelligent, engaging and thought provoking.
[5]     This emphasis on improving understanding and provoking thought through       engagement with the performance or its development is clearly evident       among school audiences already familiar with the concepts and techniques       of `gaming'.
As one student at St Bede's School, Cambridge put it:     [3rd Ring Out] shows you the effects &#8212;         because they've been saying like don't do this, don't do that because of         climate change, but no one's actually said: because this will happen &#8212;         you're just left to guess it by yourself and so [3rd       Ring Out] really showed you what could happen.
[6]     And another said:     Doing the Workshop and having the chance to hear her [Zoe Svendsen]         talk about the play made me realise just how much you need to think         about things and prepare your research before you start to act.
It has         made me change the way I now go about my acting' [7]     An evaluation of the Metis Arts' Residency at Flegg High School Norfolk [8],       where the performance was developed, showed that all of the 19 students       who completed questionnaires agreed that working with Metis had `helped me       understand the challenges we all face as a result of climate change' and       `would think more about [their] own impact on the planet and what [they]       could do to help'.
A recent general evaluation of theatrical work on       climate change singled out the impact of 3rd Ring         Out.
