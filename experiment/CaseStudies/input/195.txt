     Policy and Planning     1.
Influencing InvestNI Digital Content Strategy     In 2008, Colm Murphy was asked to make a presentation to Northern       Ireland's economic development agency, InvestNI and to review their draft       Digital Content Strategy.
Central to his submission was the argument that       a successful strategy should be based on intellectual property targets,       rather than simply job targets.
This was accepted in the InvestNI report,       Digital Contents Strategy for Northern Ireland subsequently       published in 2008.
The impact of the submission can be seen in that the       first draft of this report was still based on job creation targets but the       final report was amended in line with Murphy's suggestion.

Maximising the Potential of the Creative Industries in Northern         Ireland &#8212; CMR Public Policy Paper No.
7:     The Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee of the Northern Ireland Executive       set up an inquiry on Maximising the Potential of the Creative Industries       and Murphy wrote a paper for the inquiry (subsequently published as a CMR       Policy Document).
Murphy was then invited to make two further (oral)       submissions to the Inquiry on policies for digital media development in       other countries (these oral submissions can be found in the Hansard       transcript of the Inquiry proceedings).
This report Maximising the         Potential of the Creative Industries draws extensively on the CMR       submission (paragraph 34, page 14; paragraph 44, page 16; paragraph 98,       page 26, passim).
The Report acknowledges the impact that Media       Studies research has had: `The Committee noted examples provided         during the course of the Inquiry, which suggested a degree of successful         collaboration and co-ordination between the industry and aspects of         academia.
The Committee noted that this may be in part due to the         efforts of the University of Ulster ...'     3.
&#163;3.6m INTERREG EU Creative Futures programme - 2013-2015     The tender for this project, led by Murphy and Sarah Edge,       was won based on existing research conducted by CMR staff on how to       develop digital creative industries and on knowledge gleaned from research       on what has worked in other jurisdictions.
The Project, now called       `Honeycomb Creative Works' was launched in September 2013 and is,       therefore an `impact' project already, designed to take research already       disseminated into the stage of skills development and acquisition.
The       Special EU Programmes Body noted in welcoming the initiative, "This is a       truly innovative initiative which will build upon the wealth of natural       home-grown talent and expertise that exists within the region's creative       industries sector.
It will help generate new employment opportunities,       safeguard existing businesses in the digital content marketplace and       encourage strong economic links, on a cross-border basis."

Digital Causeway Strategy 2008     The CMR/School of Media, working with the University's School of       Computing, has helped Coleraine Borough Council formulate a Digital       Causeway strategy and marketing plan for foreign direct investment.
As a       result Coleraine is being marketed internationally by InvestNI as a hub       for cloud computing and media-related digital investments.
This is on       target to generate over &#163;20m in new high tech inward investment into       Coleraine in 2014.       http://www.digitalcauseway.com/            Digital Apps and Gaming                  History Space and Titanic Rediscovered are two mobile         application research outputs that have been developed by Helen           Jackson from her earlier explorations of the potential of         location-based and augmented reality technologies to provide innovations         in interpretation.
These augmented reality methods have had a         significant impact on both tourism stakeholders and creative media         industries nationally and offer substantial opportunities for         international applications.
(a) The NITB is currently seeking to license the technology system       developed by the CMR for the History Space project.
The license will be to       support the delivery of an NITB/HBO Game of Thrones location-based       mobile application, emphasizing the considerable international       potential of the software.
(b) History Space and Titanic RediscOvered have also       informed digital strategies in local government agencies.
The Mourne         Heritage Trust in conjunction with Newry and Mourne Council,       have used these mobile applications to inform digital interpretation       policy at local council level.
Specifically, the software has directed the       interpretive technology for one of the their key heritage centres, the Annalong         Cornmill.
MYNI is a game designed by Alan Hook and commissioned         for the NITB (available at www.myni2013.com).
It was designed to promote civic pride and internal tourism while         exploring new crowdsourcing models of data and asset acquisition for         companies.
The impacts were significant.
During the game's first run,         from 28th March to 9th May 2013, over 1800 players completed         photography-based tasks providing valuable data for the Tourist Board as         well as providing over 1700 photographs that are now owned by         the Board.
These will be used for both print and web advertising with a         projected value in excess of &#163;51,000.
The game obtained good         media coverage with the website, at its peak, seeing traffic of 2915           visitors, sending 23,000 page views in 24 hours and over 17,000           site visits over the duration of the project, a significant         increase in public engagement.
Alan Hook developed a series of collaborations with a range of         cultural organisations to promote engagement with the arts among the         general public, constructing a body of work that has had substantial         cultural and economic impact.
This body of work is made up of the pieces         The Foursquare Mayor Chair, with its 3 installations in The Void         Gallery, The Crescent Arts Centre and The Queens Film Theatre; the         Hackday This is Our Playground, the conference presentation This           is Our Playground: Recognising Students as Innovators, and the         symposium Engaging Visitors Through Play.
The whole is an         ongoing mix of action research and practice-driven investigation in         innovation in the Museums and Galleries sector.
