     The calibration-free pH measurement system invented by the Compton group       is a truly innovative       technology which represents a landmark in the field of pH sensing.
It has       led directly to the       commercial success of Senova Systems Inc, [text removed for publication].
In September 2008 Isis Innovation Ltd. exclusively licensed the patent       for calibration-free pH       sensing to San Francisco-based Senova Systems Inc [6].
The company was       founded in 2007 with       the sole aim of developing a commercial pH meter based on the Compton       research; Professor       Compton sits on Senova's advisory board.
Based on the potential of the       technology and the high       value of the IP, Senova secured initial seed funding of $ 3M and raised a       further $ 6.7M in Series B       financing by January 2012 [7].
During the three years between licensing       and finalising funding, the       company developed a smart sensor platform capable of being produced on a       commercial scale.
In       the first instance Senova designed a prototype hand-held pH sensor &#8212; the       pHit Scanner &#8212; which       offered a number of significant advantages over current standard glass       electrodes: it requires no       calibration, is temperature stable, does not suffer signal drift, can be       stored dry with no need for       electrolyte solution, can be sterilised, is physically robust and is       inexpensive to mass produce.
The scanner was previewed at Pittcon 2012, the world's largest annual       conference and expo for       laboratory science [8], and in September 2012 won the Frost &amp; Sullivan       2012 North American New       Product Innovation Award [9].
In March 2013, the pHit Scanner was       recognized with the Pittcon       Editors' Gold Award for the best new product at Pittcon 2013 [10].
Feedback from an early adoption programme (EAP) evaluating the hand-held       meter has confirmed       the effectiveness of the technology and enabled Senova to embark on the       development of a larger-       scale meter aimed at the high-tech market, which will be more profitable       than the hand-held meter       [11].

Additional venture capital       funding (from Phoenix Venture       Partners and Harris &amp; Harris Group Inc) for Senova is ongoing [12];       the continued investment       underlines the potential the technology has to revolutionise this field,       and the expectation that       Senova's products will be a commercial success.
As a result of the collaborative research between Oxford University and       Schlumberger described in       Section 2, Schlumberger filed a similar patent at roughly the same time as       [4].
This has led to a       mutually beneficial situation in which each party has rights on each       other's patent.
