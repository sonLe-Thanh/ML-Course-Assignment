     The most tangible impact has come from two strands that reach across the       UK.
The first has been significant improvement in practitioner knowledge       and confidence from training and knowledge exchange.
With Action for       Children, Daniel won a bid to the DfE for &#163;182,951.20 to develop training       materials building on the SCRI research for use by all Local Safeguarding       Children Boards in England (completed 10/7/12)1.
The Scottish       Government commissioned a version not tied to English policy, (completed       May 2013).
The materials are embedded in a DfE funded training initiative       in England led by `Child and Family Training'2.
Over 100 participating agencies have access to an e-learning module on       neglect developed by Research in Practice (RiP) which includes the       findings and a podcast by Daniel3.
It is RiP's most popular       module and between Mar '12 - Oct `13 had already been used by 439 people.
Of 107 who provided feedback 64% reported increased knowledge and 83% said       they would use the information with comments such as `Enable me to         make more informed decisions whilst working with children in care.
'; `i         will draw upon the research when dealing with possible neglect in         families'; `Yes all future work and earlier identif[i]cation of         neglect.'
All clinical staff in NHSScotland have access to the NHS       Education for Scotland Child Protection on-line Learning Resource which       includes the findings and a podcast by Daniel4.
A follow-on ESRC knowledge exchange award was obtained in 2012 for       &#163;88,493.52.
Action on Neglect used co-production to work over a       year with multi-disciplinary groups of 37 practitioners in three       participating authorities, 9 parents and 4 young people who developed       specific ways to improve `pathways to help' for neglected children at a       local level that were developed into national guidance for policy and       practice.
84 representatives from the UK attended the national launch.
161       practitioners attended final practice development events held in each       participating authority in Spring 2013, examples of feedback are `What         I will take away with me from this experience is to always remain child         focus[ed]' (Stockport); `I am planning to roll out your pack to         our college teaching team' (Barnet); `I have had so many people         compliment the event and how much the content had and will inform their         practice'; `the resource packs are beautiful and I love the positive         images of children' (BathNES).
Several authorities are drawing on       the work for service development.
The second and most significant impact strand has been policy influence.
The findings of the first review were reported to the Chair of the House       of Commons Education Committee inquiry on child protection that       subsequently moved to a new focus on responses to neglected children.
The       report cites the research and makes specific recommendations on training,       early intervention and timely responses (2012)5.
At the UK       launch of the 1st review on 24/1/12 at the House of Commons the       Children's Minister and Shadow Minister emphasised the importance of early       intervention and commitment to implement some of the recommendations.
There was an audience reach of 97,470,367 for the coverage and by March       2012 over 1,000 people had accessed information from the Action for       Children website6.
A Senior Policy Advisor said `...more MPs         wrote to Ministers here on that issue than anything else.'
The       Minister's responses to two Westminster Parliamentary Questions mentioning       the reviews (30.1.12, 19.3.12) note a consultation on children's       safeguarding performance information `this includes additional         information on neglect'; changes to social work training and changes       to statutory guidance: `Our aim is to free social workers and other         professionals from unnecessary bureaucracy...'7.
The       revised Working Together guidance on multi-professional working       includes attention to the provision of `early help'8.
The       second review was launched at the all-party Child Protection Group in       Westminster 6.2.13 where the Children's minister announced that Ofsted       would undertake a thematic review of neglect as recommended (to report in       Autumn 2013).
All the research has impacted on Scotland and the impending Children         and Young People (Scotland) Bill.
Of the Scottish report, one child       protection lead officer commented: `I have circulated it widely within         [LA] asking everyone to study the work, as I feel it should become one         of those seminal documents that very clearly and directly informs policy         in Scotland.'
(25.7.12).
Children in Scotland (the national agency       for those working with children and their families in Scotland) hosted       seminar attended by Scottish Government policy makers to explore ways in       which the body of research can continue to shape developments.
Daniel gave evidence to, and is quoted in the report of the Parliamentary       Inquiry into Children Taken into Care10.
