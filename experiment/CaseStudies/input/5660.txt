     GENIE projections of long-term global warming contributed to the Stern       Review (2006) on the economics of climate change, and GENIE users       contributed large ensembles of climate simulations to the       Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth and Fifth       Assessment Reports (2007 and 2013).
These reports are important reference       documents for policy makers.
The Environment Agency also commissioned and       has subsequently used the GENIE team's projections of millennial timescale       sea level rise [3.3] to inform planning for future coastal flood       risk and long-term waste management.
The stark implications of this research, that cutting emissions may not       be enough to avoid dangerous climate change, led to the initiation and       chairing by Shepherd of the Royal Society working group on geoengineering.
According to Richard Heap, former RS Senior Policy Adviser [5.1] "A         number of geoengineering strategies were beginning to emerge, but there         was a clear gap in knowledge about their viability and potential         impacts.
The proposal led by John Shepherd highlighted the need to         address this gap and the significant risks this posed, particularly in         the political arena."
The Royal Society (RS) report (2009) [5.2],       which objectively and authoritatively assesses geoengineering strategies       and their associated effects, has become the global standard reference for       policy-makers, opinion formers and potential investors.
In the words of       Professor David MacKay, Chief Scientific Advisor for Department of Energy       &amp; Climate Change (DECC) "It has influenced research, stimulated and         informed discussion and influenced governments and policy-makers         worldwide" [5.3].
An example is the Scoping Report Large-Scale         Intentional Interventions into the Climate System?
Assessing the Climate         Engineering Debate produced by the Kiel Earth Institute for the       German Government which cites the RS Report heavily and credits it with "attracting         attention beyond academic circles".
The Royal Society report's       publication prompted extensive media coverage (Independent, Times,       Financial Times, Guardian, Economist, Observer, New Scientist, BBC, 2009,       2010, 2011 [5.4]), and briefings for DECC Secretaries of State Ed       Miliband (20 July 2009) and Chris Huhne with Minister of State Greg Barker       (29 November 2010).
Figure 2: Geoengineering Strategies &#8212; Affordability and Effectiveness,         from [5.2]           The report's emphasis on the need for international governance of       geoengineering led to Shepherd being invited to testify to a hearing by       the US House of Representatives' Committee on Science and Technology on 5       November 2009 to examine geoengineering [5.5].
In March 2010 the       House of Commons Science and Technology Committee also published the       report of an enquiry, The Regulation of Geoengineering, which       repeatedly cites the Royal Society report as evidence [5.6].
On 3       October 2011 the US Bipartisan Policy Committee (an NGO serving both       Houses of Congress and all political parties) published the report of a       study (to which Shepherd had been the sole foreign contributor) building       on the Royal Society report and recommending a major US research programme       in the area [5.7].
The UK government now has an interdepartmental       committee on geoengineering and an official position that follows the RS       report closely [5.8].
In addition, the IPCC also subsequently held       a special Joint Expert Meeting on Geoengineering in Peru in June 2011, and       referred extensively to the Royal Society report [5.9].
The Royal Society report asserted that public attitudes towards       geoengineering should be a critical factor in considering the future of       geoengineering &#8212; specifically whether (and if so how) the public think       that these technologies should be taken forward.
This led NERC to invest       &#163;155,000 in the Ipsos MORI geoengineering public dialogue exercise, Experiment         Earth, in spring 2010 [5.10].
This gave 90 members of the       public, recruited at three centres around the UK, the chance to inform       future NERC decision-making on geoengineering.
Each recruit attended 2       daylong workshops, with a subset attending a further event at Southampton       where Professors Damon Teagle and Richard Lampitt (NERC-NOCS) gave       presentations on potential geoengineering projects.
The report of this       study presents a number of recommendations; for NERC and other research       funders and decision makers, for future public engagement on       geoengineering research and for communicating climate science.
Shepherd regularly engages with the public through popular science       articles (for example the Guardian 2011 Geoengineering: we need more         evidence before we cast our vote) or through frequently accepting       invitations to speak to a wide range of audiences who want to be informed       about geoengineering issues, in the UK and abroad.
Venues include the       Royal Society, Oxford University, National Theatre, village halls and       Museum of Madrid (Fundacion Banco Santander public lecture), several of       these lectures are freely available online [5.10].
Since its publication the Royal Society report has been an important       reference in numerous public information documents produced by Governments       and International Organisations [5.10], for example in Australia (Geoengineering,       Occasional Paper Series, Issue 1.
Office of the Chief Scientist, Canberra       2012) and UNESCO (Policy Briefs Series.
Engineering the climate:         Research questions and policy implications, November 2011).
In       addition the Solar Radiation Management Governance Initiative (SRMGI), an       international NGO-driven project was launched in March 2010 in response to       the 2009 Royal Society report.
With John Shepherd on the steering group,       SRMGI is especially focused on engaging with a wide range of stakeholders       from the developing world and emerging economies and has held workshops in       China, India, Pakistan, and Africa (Senegal, South Africa &amp; Ethiopia)       [5.10].
