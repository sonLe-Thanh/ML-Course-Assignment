     The output of grant 1, which was the conceptual design of a       nearshore wave power farm comprising bottom hinged flaps directly       connected to the sea bed with hydraulic power take off led directly to the       creation of Aquamarine Power, source 1.
The company was       specifically formed to develop this technology and continues to do so       today.
Owing to the track record of the Queen's team in conceiving device       concepts, undertaking the basic research and taking them to prototype       demonstration, as was demonstrated by the 75kW and LIMPET devices on the       Isle of Islay, private investors backed the new company initially with &#163;3       million and the Oyster project was born leading to the first prototype.
The company's website clearly states the role of the Queen's team and       Professor Whittaker in the birth of the company.
The following is a direct       quote from the Aquamarine Power website &#8212;     "Our story first started in 2001 when Professor Trevor Whittaker's         research and development team at Queen's University, Belfast began to         research flap-type wave power devices with a view to reducing the cost         of energy.
The R&amp;D team's research ultimately led to the development         of the Oyster wave energy device.
The innovative design of the Oyster         wave energy converter attracted the interest of Allan Thomson, the         retired founder of WaveGen, the UK's first ever wave power company.
Allan went on to co-fund further R&amp;D into the Oyster wave power         device.
In 2005, Allan set up Aquamarine Power to bring Oyster wave         power technology to the commercial market.
"In 2008 we completed our senior management team and our company         rapidly expanded as we went from four employees to a team of 15 in only         three months.
We continue to grow rapidly.
We now employ over 60 staff         who are all working towards our vision of making marine renewable energy         mainstream.
SSE remains a major shareholder in Aquamarine Power.
In         2010, we also secured major investment from ABB, one of the world's         largest power and automation companies."
To date the total funds raised from both private finance and public       grants are in excess of &#163;60 million.
Two prototypes have been deployed at       sea.
Oyster 1 was commissioned at the European Marine Test site on Orkney       in 2009 and Oyster 800 was commissioned spring 2013.
The research team at Queen's continues to support the development of       Oyster from hydrodynamic modelling in our two wave tanks, shown in sources           2 and 3, to numerical simulation of both the hydrodynamics and       projected electrical production.
The third and fourth generations of the       Oyster machines are currently under development by Aquamarine with support       from the Queen's team.
This complements the fundamental research being       conducted under grants 3, 4 and 5.
In addition the team is supporting wave       and tidal power research throughout Europe through MARINET which is funded       by the European Union under framework 7 and enables trans-national access       to both our wave tank and tidal test facilities (source 4).
The success of the team in attracting grant income for fundamental       research in combination with the industrial exploitation of technology       developed at Queen's is testament to the standing of the group and the       impact it has had on the marine renewable energy industry.
European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) Ltd (www.emec.org.uk) is the world's       only accredited testing laboratory for the performance assessments of wave       and tidal facilities.
Its endorsement (source 5) perhaps       best summarises the impact of this research by Queen's team:     ...Oyster is based on the original oscillating wave surge convertor         developed at Queens University by Professor Trevor Whittaker.
The wave energy industry is still in it infancy, however even at this         early stage the benefits generated from the development, installation,         commissioning and performance testing of the different machines are         apparent.
Both EMEC and Orkney have benefited from these early stage         activities and expect to benefit still further as the industry develops...
In my opinion the fledgling industry and the associated economic         activity results directly from the long established, high quality         academic work undertaken at Queens University Belfast and other         universities over many years.
In the case of Oyster I see this as a         direct result of the research undertaken by Professor Whittaker and his         team.
A further impact has been the expansion of the Queen's marine renewable       team and the inward investment in both academic staff and facilities.
In       2009 Dr Elsaesser with extensive experience of numerical modelling coastal       processes was employed as a senior lecturer and in 2012 Dr O'Driscoll, an       oceanographer was employed as a lecturer.
They have expanded the       capabilities of the group by interfacing numerical modelling with marine       biological science to quantify the impact of marine renewable structures       as well manmade pollutants in the seas and oceans.
In 2009 a &#163;1 million investment in facilities at Queen's was completed.
This included a 600 m2 building housing a 16m &#215; 18m coastal       wave basin with variable bathymetry, 24 computer controlled wave       generators and multi directional current generation.
The investment also       financed equipment to measure waves and tidal currents at sea.
This has       led to the development of a 1/10th scale tidal stream test site       in Strangford narrows which is being used by device developers from across       Europe under the PF7 funded MARINET project.
To date the tidal work has       generated &#163;1.1 million of research income.
The international standing of       the group is demonstrated by the staff profile with researchers from USA,       New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Germany, France and Italy.
