     Impact through outreach has been an integral part of all the seals       projects, with cutting-edge       academic research being targeted at as many and diverse audiences as       possible.
The recording       and analysis of a substantial new corpus of data has enabled the project       team to share exciting       new discoveries far beyond the academy, and all the SiMeW and ExOMS talks,       events and       exhibition have been underpinned by the material recorded, analysed and       interpreted by the       research.
Through knowledge transfer and a deliberate policy of public       engagement, the team has       managed to engage with the following impact types:     Impact on Practitioners and Professional Services:       The seals project has created and interpreted cultural capital, through       the team's work in gathering       material in relation to medieval seals and disseminating the same.
Major       beneficiaries of       knowledge transfer have been archivists, conservators and museum and other       heritage       professionals through continuing professional development (CPD) events       which included an ICON       / British Library conservation workshop; ExOMS CPD workshops at National       Records of Scotland       (NRS); Ruthin (Denbighshire Record Office); Cambridge (Trinity Hall);       Cardiff (Glamorgan       Archives).
Responses to this work demonstrate that the awareness of a       variety of beneficiaries and       their engagement with this material and their understanding and       appreciation of it has been       enhanced [5.4]: `Archivist: we will think about how we store &amp;       protect seals... this course has       certainly given us more knowledge &amp; ideas on how this can be done';       `Will help to inform my       conservation work'; `I would like to incorporate them [seals] in       exhibitions'; `Will think about grant       application for improved storage'.
Following ExOMS dissemination events,       heritage professionals       are, by their own acknowledgement [5.2, 5.4, 5.7, 5.8] now       better-equipped to preserve and       interpret seals as valuable heritage assets.
In some cases this is leading       to a change in policy and       procedure within institutions and groups of heritage professionals.
In       other instances, repositories       are adopting significant elements of the SiMeW / SiLC recording template       for their own collections.
For example, the NRS have acknowledged the importance of the SiMeW / SiLC       hierarchical       classification system and are considering adopting this as the template       for the systematic recording       of sealed documents across Scotland (NRS Head of Medieval Records:       `A[berystwyth] U[niversity]       model for recording seals will clearly be beneficial, as exchange of       information between       archive/library institutions...can be accomplished more readily with a       common format for data       entry', SIP placement Completion Report; [5.9]).
Following a       meeting with the project team and       Portable Antiquities Scheme England, adjustments in the PAS template /       procedures for recording       seals are being considered.
Staff from Powys Archives who had attended the       Ruthin event       contacted the project team for advice when considering the purchase of a       medieval deed because       they had been made aware that seals can help identify and authenticate       such items [5.7, 5.8].
The       deed was acquired through public donations and the role the seal played in       verifying authenticity       was highlighted by the media [5.14].
Cultural life:       The seals projects team have also engaged with much broader audiences       through, among other       things, exhibitions, public talks and media (broadcast and print).
Through       all these activities there       has been an emphasis on enabling members of the general public better to       understand and       appreciate their cultural heritage.
In particular, Seals in Context: Medieval Wales and the Welsh Marches       was a major exhibition,       (21/04/2012 - 29/09/2012) curated by the SiMeW team and held in Hengwrt       Gallery at the National       Library of Wales.
This emerged directly from the team's research, with 42       of the 47 items on       display newly recorded by SiMeW, while the analytical and interpretative       work of the project       facilitated the selection and interpretation of the items (interpretation       made available to broad       audiences through bilingual display panels).
According to data from NLW,       5008 people visited the       exhibition, comparing favourably with other recent exhibitions at NLW       (e.g.
c.4,500 visitors to the       Clive Hicks-Jenkins exhibition in the Hengwrt Gallery in spring-summer       2011).
Comments in the       Visitor Book were overwhelmingly positive, and repeat visits and further       investigation of seals       prompted by the exhibition were indicated in several cases [5.1]:       `lovely to see and learn' (visitor       from Utrecht); `will definitely come back' (visitor from Wales).
The       exhibition was accompanied by a       complementary publication with extended commentary on exhibition items and       thematic       introductory essays contextualising the material, designed for a wide       audience (Seals in Context:         Medieval Wales and the Welsh Marches, ISBN ISBN 978-1-84521-486-9).
Special interest groups have also benefited from ExOMS       knowledge-transfer; local and family       history societies, amateur archaeologists, metal-detectorists [5.5].
The seals projects team have       delivered a number of talks and workshops, drawing upon the SiMeW data-set       and interpretative       work.
Particular attention has been paid to tailoring presentations and       activities to individual groups       and local areas (e.g.
drawing on material from north Wales for the Ruthin       event), so that       participants can benefit from a closer engagement with their particular       locale and area of special       interest.
In this way individuals and groups have been able better to       appreciate and engage with       their cultural heritage (`Abandoned Communities' local history group       member: `talk has given me       much useful information' [5.5]).
A series of public talks, workshops and a Q&amp;A session at the National       Eisteddfod 2012 have all       drawn extensively upon the new data and findings of the seals projects and       have facilitated the       release of the cultural potential offered by seals, especially in Wales       and the English border       counties.
Events have included a National Museum Wales Origins       lunchtime talk; NLW Drwm talk       (`best lunchtime talk ever', [5.3]); public talks at Ruthin,       Cambridge and Cardiff (feedback includes       `A fascinating insight into... how important this is as a historical       resource &#8212; particularly social       history'; `will now examine them [seals] more closely and it will help in       [my] future study'; `I am       going to do more reading on the subject'; [5.5]); Tewkesbury       Medieval Festival 2013 stand in the       education tent.
One visitor emailed `I am developing my wax seal       re-enactment display and have       made a lot of progress and gathered a lot of new ideas since reading your       book [Seals in Context]       and meeting you'; [5.6]).
Media engagement has drawn extensively upon SiMeW / SiLC findings and       reached a diverse       range of beneficiaries.
This has included invited participation in Wyneb         Glynd&#373;r, S4C, 2010       (broadcast March 2011; 15th ranked programme on S4C during week       of broadcast; repeated on       two further occasions, Section [5.13]); Welsh History Month essay,       Western Mail [5.11].
Education:       At HEI level, students from a range of universities have benefited from       training workshops,       including: 4/02/10: American International University in London; 10/01/11:       Royal Holloway,       University of London; 22/02/12: University of Lincoln [5.10]     The project's commitment to education and cultural engagement remains of       central importance to       the team's work.
An important feature of this is that data and the       interpretative results of the seals       projects are being made available through the Exploring Medieval Seals       website [5.12].
