     Georgakopoulou's influence on language education in Greece has its roots       in her and Goutsos' Text and Communication (3.5), originally       published in 1999, whose impact continues to the present day.
This was the       first handbook of discourse studies written in Greek, and achieved a wide       readership beyond academe &#8212; it was singled out by the national newspaper To         Vima as an `essential read for the friends of language and       linguistics' in its `Best books of the Year 1999-2000'.
The book has gone       through nine impressions, and publishers competed to produce the       substantially revised second edition of 2011; it has sold around 25,000       copies, a striking number for the Greek market (5.1).
The book created a       terminology accessible to, and applicable in practice by, teachers in       primary and secondary education.
Since 1999 it has become increasingly       influential on educational theory, instruction and practice in Greece.
It       is currently a prescribed textbook for undergraduate and postgraduate       programmes in Linguistics, Media and Communication Studies, and       Translation, at universities including Athens, Thessaloniki, Patras,       Aegean, and Ionian (5.2), and thus has been and continues to be studied by       the many philology and education graduates who become primary and       secondary schoolteachers.
Since 2008 the book has been included on the       list issued by the Ministry of Education as `Guides for the Teacher' for       the teaching of Greek in schools (5.3), and it now serves, especially       through its `Tasks' section, as a resource for Greek teachers of language       skills in primary and secondary schools, particularly those with pupils       whose native language is not Greek (see feedback below).
Because of her high academic profile in discourse analysis, and her       proven ability through Text and Communication to make her own and       others' sociolinguistic research accessible and useful to teachers,       Georgakopoulou with Goutsos and Styliani were commissioned to write Greek         as a Foreign Language (3.6) by the Greek Ministry of Education as       part of the Programme for the Education of Muslim Minority Children in       Greece, funded by the EU with 17M euros for its first phase 1998- 2007,       and another 9M euros for the current second phase (5.4).
The programme was       aimed at the production of material suitable for the needs of ethnic       minority children for whom Greek is their second or a foreign language, a       group which has grown considerably in the last fifteen years (almost 2,000       secondary schools in Thrace together have some 25,000 Muslim pupils), and       for the training of primary and secondary teachers working in schools with       a substantial percentage of ethnic minority children.
Given the political       sensitivities in western Thrace, where Muslim students are a majority but       `minority' schools have no formal status, this material has had to be       directed at teachers through their post-qualification training.
With the       economic crisis since 2010 and consequent growth in anti-immigrant       sentiment, practical support for educational integration of these children       has taken on an unexpected urgency.
Georgakopoulou's own chapter in Greek         as a Foreign Language is inspired and informed by her small stories       research, and presents her results to be useful for teachers and to have       an impact in the classroom.
She promotes pupil agency, particularly       important for minority children whose voices were often ignored in the       traditional teacher-centred classrooms.
From 2004 on it has thus       contributed to enhancement of the teaching of many thousands of children       in Greek primary and secondary schools, especially those having to learn       Greek.
Individual responses from professionals in teacher training and       teaching in Greece indicate that teachers' attention to the place of       small-story-telling in their lives helps these children build self-esteem       and improve their Greek-language acquisition.
`Departments of Education with a special interest in the needs of ethnic       minority children make extensive use of this book', writes one Professor       of Sociolinguistics (Patras); `In my MA courses where I teach the       narrative construction of identities, I constantly refer to her books and       articles, including the most recent ones, where Georgakopoulou introduces       the analytical model for small stories.
.
.
[and, of his own work] In the       teaching proposals that we put forward, Georgakopoulou's work was more       than valuable.
This can also be verified/confirmed by school teachers who       exploit her work in the preparation of their educational material'.
Another Professor of Education (Athens) comments, `Let me explain the       problem a bit: there weren't and still are no official minority high       schools .
.
[so] there was also no official and non-conflictual way to       have alternative educational material .
.
.
Alexandra's study [sc.
3.6]       has been very successful and influential, precisely because it stresses       the availability of or "alternative" materials and media.
.
.
Even today       there is only a handful of studies concentrating on learners.'
An       experienced high school teacher with ethnic minority pupils reports how       she implements strategies suggested in Georgakopoulou's works: `Teaching       them essay writing, quite often I ask them to write past stories with       memories from their homeland as well as future stories on how they would       like to be in Greece, i.e.
their host country .
.
.
I quite often ask my       students to exchange their stories via e-mail or facebook messages.
Thus,       I discuss and analyse in class both my students' stories as well as their       responses to the stories they receive from their class-mates .
.
.
the       writing of personal narratives motivates students and is particularly       suitable for promoting inter-cultural communication via enabling students       to express their cultural identities.'
(5.5)     In the wider world too, Georgakopoulou's small stories research has begun       to have an impact in language teaching and learning, and also psychology.
Particularly in the field of TESOL (`Teaching English to speakers of other       languages'), attention to the sorts of communicative activities that are       the focus of small stories research is being promoted over the traditional       content analysis of autobiographical interviews as a means for learners       and teachers to reflect on their pedagogical experiences and identities,       and thus to help pupils become more confident and effective learners       (5.6).
The insights of small stories research are also being drawn on in       life-stance counselling to help psychologists develop flexible `on the go'       models of therapy that can address the needs of specific populations which       for medical or social reasons cannot produce coherent `meaningful'       narrative accounts of their lives, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's       patients, the homeless, and young immigrants in youth centres (5.7).
Georgakopoulou's small stories research was intended to produce an       analytical apparatus for academic sociolinguistics.
Its usefulness for &#8212;       and impact on &#8212; teaching practices (especially in second-language       contexts) was unforeseen.
However, it has since been proactively developed       and promoted by Georgakopoulou through publications aimed at teachers, and       is ongoing and sustainable, with her direct involvement: the Greek       Ministry of Education has appointed her to the committee of the Hellenic       Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education which is currently (late       2013) evaluating the teaching and research practices of Education and       Philology Departments in HEIs in Greece.
The potential of the small       stories approach for clinical psychology is now to be explored further by       Georgakopoulou and Ridsdale (Institute of Psychiatry, King's) as co-investigators 	  in an ERC-funded project for 2014-19, based in English       (King's), on `Egomedia.
The Impact of New Media on Forms and Practices of       Self-Presentation'.
