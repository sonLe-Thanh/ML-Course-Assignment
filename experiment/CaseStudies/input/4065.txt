     Our research has informed the damage-tolerant design and lifing of       aircraft structures in the       presence of residual stresses and a recently-identified source of fatigue       initiation caused during       airframe maintenance.
We have developed the contour method of residual stress measurement,       since 2002, into a       validated industrial tool for measuring residual stresses in complex       engineering components, and       integrated it with non-destructive stress measurement techniques capable       of resolving fine spatial       detail.
We have applied our comprehensive toolkit of stress analysis       techniques to aircraft       structures in collaboration with the MoD, the US Air Force Research       Laboratory, Airbus, BAE       Systems, Bombardier, and Alcoa.
In 2013 we set up a business unit at the       OU providing a contour       method measurement service for industry.
Our research into the development, application and validation of the       contour method is now       enabling its uptake in industry:     `The OU had the unique capability to measure large field residual         stresses with the accuracy and         repeatability required for safety critical structures.
We were convinced         by the validation evidence         provided by their research that the contour technology was at a stage         suitable for transfer into         our work on airframes and associated components.
... As a direct result         of collaboration with         Professor Fitzpatrick and his staff, along with focused training and         technical support provided by         the research team at the OU, AFRL/RQ now has an organic means by which         to evaluate the         stress state of laser peened test coupons and structures.
... We are         currently using our on-site         contouring for several internal research programs and also to support         collaborative research with         both NASA and the US Navy.'

Our research has also demonstrated accurate prediction of fatigue crack       growth for damage       tolerant design of integral forged structures that do not have the natural       crack arrest characteristics       of conventionally riveted designs.
In particular, our research into the       design of bonded crack       retarders since 2005 through various projects for life enhancement of new       and existing aircraft       structures has enabled Alcoa to:     `[establish] collaborations with producers of advanced fibers and         adhesive systems to evaluate         and develop material systems to further improve the design concepts         evaluated in past and         current collaborations with The Open University ... the results from the         bonded crack retarder         projects [have been implemented] in several United States Air Force         Research Laboratory         funded projects to evaluate selectively reinforced and hybrid laminate         aerospace structural         concepts for wing and fuselage application' [5.2].
`Research in two key areas has resulted in an improved understanding         of the mechanisms by         which adhesively bonded selective reinforcement may be exploited ...         Aided by The Open         University's contributions, Airbus has achieved TRL3 [Technology       Readiness Level 3] for         bonded crack retarders applied to wing structures, and expects to         achieve TRL4 in mid-2014.
This represents a sizable investment to date, and has firmly established         selective reinforcement         as a candidate for aircraft wings.'

Following the discovery of unanticipated fatigue cracks from       maintenance-induced scribe marks in       some airframes from the 1990s onwards, and an instruction from the       regulator to investigate the       problem, we developed a new method from 2006-9 to determine residual       stress at a very small       length-scale.
`The OU group was able to supply us with detailed mapping of the         residual stress and hardening         associated with different types of scratch damage.
Their work was a         significant advance in the         methodology that was available to us, and was distinctive because         although the determination of         the residual stress around such small-scale features is extremely         challenging, they provided         cross-validation of their measurements by developing the nanoindentation         method to determine         the scratch residual stresses, and compare the results with synchrotron         X-ray data.
The overall         work programme revealed the complexity of the interaction of the         hardening from the tool and         the residual stress generated.
... A key outcome was that this work         informed the conclusion by         the regulator to base the accept-or-repair decision on scratch depth         criteria.'
[5.4].
The scribe marks work led to the investigation from 2008 of laser shock       peening as a possible       repair strategy (now patented by Airbus) which has now broadened to a       programme looking at       laser peening for life enhancement and improved damage tolerance.
`We funded the OU to study residual stress generation from laser shock         peening as a candidate         technique [for repair].
An early result caused us to change the         direction of the programme         rapidly.
The OU mapping of the laser peen stress field at much higher         spatial resolution than we         had ever seen previously led us to investigate different peen methods         from different providers.
Again, the OU's use of multiple, cross-validated techniques, was vital,         particularly when the data         generated contradicted that provided by the OEMs!
The OU's work on the         contour method of         stress measurement, and the research to extend the method to new         capability for measuring         near-surface stresses, was very important to underpin this work.
`A key outcome to-date of this work is that the laser peen technology         has formally progressed         through the Airbus Technology Readiness Level review system, with the OU         making a direct         input to that process.'
