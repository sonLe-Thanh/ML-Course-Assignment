     By providing key data to the World Health Organization, national       governments, world leaders, and the general public, the University of       Oxford's MPHD has made a significant contribution to the global fight       against malaria.
MPHD's research has led to:     The Malaria Atlas Project     The Malaria Atlas Project is an interactive and globally accessible       online mapping tool, which publishes MPHD's epidemiological, geographic       and demographic data.
The Malaria Atlas Project receives an average of       70,000 hits from around 216 nations every year (including all malaria       endemic countries in the world).
MPHD work in collaboration with national       governments in Africa to develop Malaria Atlas Project maps specific to       the needs of each nation.
A recent Malaria Programme Review conducted in       Namibia relied on the Malaria Atlas Project's "Malaria Risk in Namibia,       2009" map7 to provide updated data on transmission risk in       Namibia8.
Malaria Atlas Project maps4,5 have also       been used by African nations to seek funding for malaria aid and       interventions, including Kenya and Somalia's successful proposals to the       Global Fund in August 20109,10.
Changes in WHO Policy and Practice       The research on the distribution of impregnated nets carried out by MPHD       in Kenya3 led directly to changes in WHO policy.
Following new       guidance released in 2007, the WHO now recommends that insecticidal nets       be distributed free, or highly subsidised, to all members of affected       communities11.
In a press release distributed by the WHO, Arata       Kochi, head of the WHO's Global Malaria Programme made the following       statement regarding MPHD's research: "This data from Kenya ends the         debate about how to deliver long-lasting insecticidal nets.
No longer         should the safety and well-being of your family be based upon whether         you are rich or poor.
When insecticide treated mosquito nets are easily         available for every person, young or old, malaria is reduced"11.
This policy change, leading to the scaled-up delivery of insecticide       treated bed nets, has significantly reduced malaria-related child       mortality among African communities12.
A study from the World       Health Organization, published in 2011, showed that the rapid increase in       the use of ITNs in Zanzibar led to a reduction in mortality of 75% within       5 years of scaled-up intervention12.
This paper showed that       intensified malaria control (as recommended by MPHD) has, and will,       significantly contribute to the success of the WHO's Millennium         Development Goal 4 target, to reduce mortality in children under the       age of five by two-thirds between 1990 and 201512.
Improved Global Resource Allocation and Funding       By providing new estimates showing the global burden of malaria, research       undertaken by MPHD has been critical for funding and international       planning of resources required for malaria control.
MPHD's epidemiological       studies and maps have been used by the UK Department for International       Development13, the World Bank14, and the       WHO Roll Back Malaria Partnership15.
The following statement       from Alastair Robb, the UK Department for International Development's       Senior Health Adviser and Regional Malaria Adviser for Africa,       encapsulates the broad impact of MPHD's work on funding, national       planning, policy and risk reduction in Africa13: "The work         of Snow and the Malaria Public Health and Epidemiology Group has been         very influential.
It has had an impact on decisions of donors, national         programmes and other researchers.
They have highlighted the importance         of knowing more about malaria epidemiology, so that national policies         are based on evidence.
Their work is already being used to help target         money so that it will achieve maximal benefit.
This is coming at an         important time in malaria control.
DFID has been influenced by the         approach taken by Snow and his team.
Recent conversations with WHO, RBM,         US PMI, Gates, CDC and Swiss Tropical Institute have all referenced the         work of Snow's team in helping them refine their thinking from a blue         print approach to malaria to a more nuanced approach"13.
Resources provided by the WHO's Roll Back Malaria Partnership have also       been guided by MPHD's data.
The following `Letter Of Recommendation' from       Dr Thomas Teuscher, Executive Director for the WHO Roll Back Malaria       Partnership, emphasises the importance of MPHD's research in this field15.
"The KEMRI-University of Oxford-Wellcome Trust Collaborative Program         under your leadership has been one of the principal providers of         scientific evidence that operationally guides the malaria control         community.
Your recent work has supported the targeting of international         aid in support of malaria control to regions where level of endemicity,         population at risk and domestic income produce maximum value for money.
Your continued work on the epidemiology of malaria provides partners         like RBM with essential guidance on global resource allocation for         malaria control"15.
