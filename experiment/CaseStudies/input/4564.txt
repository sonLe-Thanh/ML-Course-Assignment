     During the impact period, UAL researchers have curated and/or designed       numerous exhibitions that exploit their innovative approach to curatorial       practice and exhibition making.
The articulation of theoretical concepts       in fashion exhibitions has played a part in the successful extension of       the audience for fashion history and theory.
In an area where the       commercial interests of the fashion industry have to be recognised,       academic fashion research is prized for its neutrality, helping public       engagement to become more meaningful.
Indicators of the significance and       reach of impact are demonstrated by the range and quality of the venues at       which work is shown, visitor feedback, high-profile partnerships and       commissions, attendance figures, and extensive media coverage.
Examples       include:             SHOWstudio: fashion revolution (2009), Somerset House.
Co-curated by Alistair O'Neill (with Claire Catterall and Professor         Penny Martin) utilised innovative forms of communicating with the         audience such as interactive co-design and new media interventions.
Attracted nearly 25,000 visitors.
The Land Girls:             Cinderellas of the Soil, (2009), Brighton Museum         &amp; Art Gallery.
Curated by de la Haye.
The Director of the Royal         Pavilion and Head of Museums credited the `innovative and imaginative           approach that the exhibition took' resulting `in a show of           appeal and interest to a wide range of visitors'.
Ninety per cent         of visitors rating it highly and 70 per cent felt inspired by the         exhibition.
More than 1100 school children participated in the related         education programme and over 2600 people attended adult and family         special events.
Attracted over 45,000 visitors.
The Concise Dictionary of Dress (2010) curated by Clark in         collaboration with Adam Phillips, commissioned by Artangel `the           doyens of site-specific work' (The Observer), with the V&amp;A.
The first time Artangel had worked with a curator as opposed to an arts         practitioner.
The installation was described as a `spellbinding           adventure' (Frieze) and as lighting up `unexpected places with           allure' (The Observer).
Chlo&#233;.

The Fashion in Film festivals (three since 2008) have been         hosted by major cultural institutions including Tate Modern, BFI         Southbank, Barbican, Institute of Contemporary Arts, Institut Fran&#231;ais         and Museum of the Moving Image/Tribeca Grand (New York).

The festival has been described as `curating a selection           of films that are rare and just as rich in terms of inspiration' (Dazed           and Confused 2010); `supremely dazzling and unique' (Steve         Leggett, Program Coordinator National Film Preservation Board, Library         of Congress 2008); having `a brilliant inclusivity [...] the           treatment is rightly academic but the subject matter is fascinating to           all with an interest in clothing and cinema' (GQ 2008); and         bringing `forgotten wonders to the screens of London' (Amelia           Magazine 2010).
Evans co- curated the fourth Fashion in Film         festival in 2013 with Uhlirov&#225;.
Research disseminated by publications has reached an audience outside of       academia.
Fashion at the Edge has never been out of print since it       was first published in 2003 and is now in its fourth printing.
A review       for Evans's recent Yale publication The Mechanical Smile: Modernism         and the First Fashion Shows in France and America, 1900-1929       (2013), describes Evans as `a rare academic in that she can actually         write in a way that the rest of us, who are not academics, can         understand and appreciate' and Fashion at the Edge as `an         instant classic of modern criticism, commentary and elucidation'       (Business of Fashion, 2013).
De la Haye's writing for V&amp;A publications       include Lucile Ltd: London, Paris, New York and Chicago 1890s-1930s       (2009); Chanel: Couture and Industry (2011) the A           to Z of Style (2011); and Clara           Button and the Magical Hat Day (2011) illustrated by Emily       Sutton.
Lucile Ltd was described by The New York Times as `a         book for true fashion geeks'.
De la Haye and co-author Valerie       Mendes were interviewed on Radio 4's Women's Hour in relation to the       publication, reaching an estimated audience of 3.8 million.
Clara         Button and the Magical Hat Day (2011) was the first ever children's       fiction book published by the V&amp;A.
Based on the V&amp;A collections       and drawing on de la Haye's research on the narrative of objects as       holders of memory it has been described as a `beautifully illustrated,         imaginative story' (Jacqueline Wilson).
In seven weeks the print run       sold out and was reprinted and a paperback version and French and Italian       versions have been published.
A second book in the series Clara Button         and the Wedding Day Surprise was commissioned by the V&amp;A       (published October 2013).
A Clara Button App produced by the V&amp;A and       narrated by de la Haye launched in July 2012, and featured in The 50         best children's apps for smartphones and tablets (The Guardian) and       20 best iPhone and iPad apps for kids (Apps Playground).
The representation and communication of fashion by the industry has       changed in recent years.
Rather than simply being about the garment       itself, it now encompasses fashion as image mediated through the media,       exhibitions, fashion films, blogging, online publishing and magazines.
Here UAL researchers have demonstrated that fashion history and theory       have relevance.
Evans, O'Neill and de la Haye participated in live panel       discussion during London Fashion Week 2012 and Paris Fashion Week 2013 for       the influential SHOWstudio.com.
O'Neill was consultant on British         Style Genius, five hour-long programmes on BBC 2 (2008) with YouTube       clips from the series being viewed over 200,000 times.
Evans was the       second individual to be covered in the My Career series in Elle       (2012), and was interviewed by Donatien Grau in AnOther Magazine       (2012) in a series that asks prominent thinkers and practitioners about       fashion and its connections to contemporary creativity.
For Chlo&#233;.
Attitudes a series of digital films were created for Chlo&#233;.com       to which Clark contributed the brief and featured in three of them.
Other       examples of impact reaching into the fashion industry include emerging       designer Phoebe English interviewing Evans for ideas on how to stage her       2013 London Fashion Week show, and commissioned extensions of Chlo&#233;.
Attitudes being designed by Clark for Selfridges Concept       store/window; Isetan, Tokyo; and Barneys, NYC.
