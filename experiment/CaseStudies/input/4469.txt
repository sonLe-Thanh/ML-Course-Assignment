     The research has helped to raise the profile of children and young people       with caring       responsibilities in families affected by HIV.
By identifying the factors       that influence involvement and       outcomes in young care-giving, the research has led to an increased       recognition of young people's       and families' needs, enhancing awareness among professionals and helping       them develop       appropriate support services.
The research has involved and been       communicated to audiences       both in the UK and internationally (Eastern and Southern Africa and       beyond).
New policy and support services       Prior to this research, there was very little recognition in international       development policy of       children's caring roles in families affected by HIV and virtually no       specific support for this       marginalised group.
Through engagement with professional networks and       practitioners (such as       UNICEF Better Care Network; the Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Inter       Agency Task Team       on Children, and OVCSupport.net), the research findings have led to new       developments in policy       and practice for care-giving children and have been used to secure new       support services in East       Africa.
After workshops in Kampala highlighted the priorities of children living       in child- and youth-headed       households, the National Community of Women living with HIV and AIDS in       Uganda (NACWOLA)       developed a grant proposal to support this group in East Africa.
In       collaboration with Healthlink       Worldwide and Tanzanian and Kenyan NGOs, NACWOLA secured funding (&#163;       166,588 over three       years reaching a total of 1800 beneficiaries from four districts in       Uganda) from the UK Department       for International Development's Civil Society Challenge Fund for a       `Children's Rights in Africa:       Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya' project in 2009.
Publications            Dr Evans was consulted on the development of an international         programme manual for working         with young carers and their families, Supporting Young Carers         (REPSSI, 2012), drawing on her         expertise on sibling caregiving and children caring for parents with         HIV.
Evans' book with Saul Becker, completed after she joined the         University of Reading, has         attracted positive feedback, as evidenced in the following testimonial:          "Special thanks to Ruth Evans and Saul Becker for their excellent and       comprehensive book       published in 2009 &#8212; Children Caring for Parents with HIV and AIDS:         Global Issues and Policy         Responses, Policy Press.
These guidelines drew heavily on this       particular publication" (REPSSI,       2012, p.4).
Evans co-authored a case study on dealing with distress in interviews         with children for the         UNICEF (2013) publication and web resource, Ethical Research           Involving Children.
Evans contributed to two national guidance brochures (published by The         Children's Society         and the National Children's Bureau in 2008) aiming to improve practice         and support for young         carers and families affected by HIV among professionals.
These brochures         have been widely         disseminated to young carers support workers and health and social care         professionals in the         UK through capacity-building workshops and conferences and through         online open access.
Research reports and a news article about the findings are available         on the University of         Reading website.
The findings have also been presented at two public         seminars in the UK (at         the University of Reading in December 2010 and Birkbeck College,         University of London, in         June 2011).
This has raised awareness about the needs of young carers         and families affected         by HIV among members of the public.
Development of CPRC research       The project's identification of the desire among young people to tackle       inheritance disputes and the       stigmatisation of orphaned children led directly to policy-oriented       research on asset inheritance       commissioned by the CPRC.
Evans presented the policy-oriented paper and       young people's video-recorded       dramas about property grabbing at the CPRC/Overseas Development Institute       Roundtable on `Inheritance and the Intergenerational Transmission of       Poverty' in London in       October 2010, and at public seminars.
The peer-reviewed open-access paper       was published on       the CPRC website, and the findings have been published in academic       journals, including those       aimed at practitioners working in Africa, such as the 2012 special issue       of the African Journal of         AIDS Research on 'Resilience and Coping Strategies of HIV-affected       Children in Sub-Saharan       Africa'.
This paper and the children's video were presented at an       international seminar at the       Resource Centre for International Development, University of Bergen,       Norway in November 2012       and reviewed by OVCSupport.net in the What's new in research?
November 2012 newsletter.
Capacity-building       The research enhanced the knowledge of professionals and enabled       organisations such as The       Children's Society and Africa Advocacy Foundation (AAF) to secure       significant funding to develop       capacity-building activities and new support programmes for young carers       in the UK.
In April 2010,       AAF commented that the research `enabled us to gain better understanding       of the positive and       negative impact of caring and the level of appropriateness of roles       undertaken by our       beneficiaries'.
Furthermore, Dr Evans was asked to write a reference in       support of a new AAF       Young Carers project in London, which was funded by Comic Relief through       The Carers Trust in       2010 (&#163;73,433, over three years, with &#163;5000 in additional small grants).
The project has reached       137 young carers and 164 parents and over 500 families affected by HIV in       London.
The AAF       young carers project also contributed to the development of a       family-specific peer support       programme within AAF adult HIV services, training of multi-agency       professionals, training of 30       young carers as young champions and peer mentors and raising issues of       concern with MPs in       Parliament.
Dr Evans directly contributed to the development of new support services,       training and capacity-building       of professionals working with children and families affected by HIV in the       UK through her       participation in the National Steering Group of The Children's Society       Young Carers Affected by       HIV/AIDS Project, funded by the Elton John AIDS Foundation (&#163;190,625,       2009-12), and through       the presentations she gave at three national capacity-building events for       multi-agency       professionals organised by The Children's Society in London, in May and       July 2010, and       Manchester, in March 2011.
Presentations and other public appearances       Presentations given by Dr Evans at policy workshops have enhanced the       knowledge of       international development professionals about young people's caring       responsibilities in the context       of HIV.
They include `Getting Caregiving Children on the Agenda', given at       the London School of       Economics and Political Science, University of London, in 2011, and a       presentation made at a       Panos/Healthlink Worldwide seminar on orphans and vulnerable children in       2008.
She was the       plenary speaker at the following events for policymakers and       practitioners:            National Children's Bureau Conference on Children affected by HIV,         London, November 2007       Princess Royal Trust for Carers Annual Young Carers Workers'         Conference, March 2008       `1Young Carers and their Families International Roundtable Seminar',         organised by The         Children's Society, London, 9 November 2012       `Involving children and young people affected by HIV/AIDS in shaping         up services in the Eastof England' Conference, organised by the Centre         For All Families Positive Health, Luton, 1 July         2011          She facilitated the `Young carers living with HIV in refugee families'       workshop at a Children's       Society seminar in London, March 2009.
Dr Evans was invited to a Reading HIV Multi-Agency Stakeholder Meeting in       May 2009.
Following       this, she was invited to become a Patron of Thames Valley Positive       Support, a third-sector       organisation supporting people living with HIV in Berkshire &#8212; a role she       continues to hold today.
