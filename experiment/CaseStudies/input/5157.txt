     Parkinson's disease is the second commonest neurodegenerative disease,       now with a lifetime risk in the UK of 4%.
Approximately 200,000 people       suffer from PD in the UK (prevalence ~1/300).
The treatment of PD is       currently directed to improving the motor symptoms caused by dopamine       deficiency.
This is effective in the early stages of the disease, but with       progression, non-motor, non-dopaminergic features such as cognitive,       autonomic and psychiatric disturbances dominate and cause a significant       deterioration of quality of life.
Before our work in this area, there was       little recognition of these non-motor features and no means to assess       their prevalence, importance or measure their response to treatment.
Physicians/neurologists in the clinic had no means to evaluate the extent       and severity of this important aspect of PD, and patients had no way to       communicate easily the type, severity and frequency of their non-motor       problems.
The scales that we have developed have provided clinicians with       the tools to assess non-motor symptoms and our questionnaires have given       the patient the method to convey the severity of the impact of their       non-motor features on their life.
These aspects are crucial in delivering       improved treatment and care to both the patient and more useful       information to the care-giver.
Our scales have now been widely incorporated into clinical practice.
For       example, the National Parkinson's Audit Report 2011 noted that many       services were using our questionnaire in preference to one of those       recommended in the Occupational Therapy Best Practice Guidelines [a].
Use of the questionnaire is recommended by Parkinson's UK who have made it       available in print and on their website.
They recommend that: "This is         a questionnaire for people with Parkinson's to complete to help health         professionals assess their non-motor Parkinson's symptoms.
It should be         completed before visiting your doctor or Parkinson's nurse" [b].
The scale was incorporated into the Department of Health's 18-week       commissioning pathway for Tremor (Parkinson's Disease) which recommended       it as a quality of life outcome measure [c].
It is recommended in       Scottish Guidelines on Diagnosis and pharmacological management of         Parkinson's disease (SIGN 113) [d].
Services treating PD require the questionnaire to be completed in       advance, for example King's College Hospital: "What is required before       referring a patient: For Parkinson's NMSQuest to be completed as per       Department of Health 18-week pathway for Parkinson's (tremor)" [e].
Our clinical services for PD patients at both the Royal Free and UCLH now       routinely use the non-motor questionnaire and scale as part of the       holistic clinical evaluation of Parkinson's disease patients as a means to       design therapeutic strategies at a personal patient level, and to evaluate       the effect of the strategy.
We are now working with the Chief Executive of       Parkinson's UK and his team to develop the model for the UK's first `UK       Centre of Excellence' for the management pathway of Parkinson's disease to       include non-motor assessment [f].
This model will then be rolled       out across the UK.
The scales and questionnaires have been adopted by a number of societies       and are widely recommended in guidelines.
The International Parkinson and       Movement Disorder Society (an international professional society of       healthcare professionals) provides our questionnaire on their website [g].
The Parkinson Society of Canada has also produced two guides (one for       patients and one for clinicians) which are based on the NMS questionnaire       [h].
The Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of       Neurology reported that: "The NMS Quest study established a valid and         reliable questionnaire to identify nonmotor symptoms in PD" [i].
The scale is also recommended by the European Parkinson's Disease       Association who say that: "This 30-point questionnaire recognises that         non-movement difficulties often occur in Parkinson's and that it is         important for a doctor to be aware of their extent and the impact they         have on life so that treatment takes these into account.
Areas covered         include sleep, Constipation, vision, smell, sexual problems and memory.
The inclusion of such topics in the questionnaire has been found helpful         in opening a dialogue on subjects that might otherwise be ignored or may         be considered to be embarrassing" [j].
The US Parkinson's       Disease Non-Motor Group also provide the questionnaire [k].
The       questionnaire has also been validated for use in other populations and       translated accordingly.
It is in use in Japan, North America and many       countries in Europe.
The non-motor questionnaire and scale have recently been incorporated as       secondary endpoints into international Phase II/III clinical trials for       symptomatic treatment in Parkinson disease [l].
