     Swansea's research in membrane optimisation processes has delivered       international economic, societal, environmental and health impacts through       the novel application of membranes and AFM to food processing, water       treatment and medicine.
Close engagement with industry has informed the       research throughout the period, ensuring the development, implementation       and adoption of new technologies by industrial organisations in the UK,       Europe and Middle East.
The unit's record of active industrial engagement       is evidenced by its recognition as a Centre of Excellence for Technology       and Industrial Collaboration and subsequently a Knowledge Transfer Centre.
In the food processing industry, our membrane optimisation       technology has been exploited through the development of ab initio       modelling techniques, novel processes and systems [R1, R5].
An example of       a novel industrial process arising from the research is the separation of       lactose from whey by Volac, a leader in the application of dairy       nutrition, manufacturing and supplying performance nutrition products       globally.
In 2008, with reference to our membrane and process systems,       Volac used this membrane separation as a process innovation and invested         &#163;8 million into its plant, establishing a new lactose refining and       drying system said to be "the only kit of its kind in Europe".
[Group Technical Manager, Processing &amp; Technology, Lampeter UK]     In 2009, First Milk were able to base an audit on their current       processing stream on our membrane process optimisation research [R1, R5].
As a result, they replaced evaporators with reverse osmosis membrane       technology, with an investment of &#163;3 million in new whey       processing equipment, which has delivered more than &#163;500,000 of energy       savings at the site in Haverfordwest each subsequent year, as well as       improving the quality of whey produced at the creamery.
These process       improvements impact on an international scale as First Milk supply milk,       cheese and ingredients to an international market.
"In total, the membrane optimisation procedure at First Milk has         induced an investment of &#163;3m, with a net saving of over &#163;2m       since 2009" (Site Manager First Milk Cheese Co Ltd) 	Alongside commercial impacts, our research is delivering societal and environmental       impacts through the production of novel membranes and processes to improve         water and waste water treatment with respect to the environmental       impact of industry.
For example, our research on membrane fouling combined       with novel membrane modification was used to improve nanofiltration for       production of clean water [R4].
A membrane modification technique based on       UV-initiated graft polymerisation was used by Water Nano to produce a new       series of membrane systems for desalination and household water in the       Gulf.
"the membrane research at Swansea University, in particular the         development of the membrane modification technique based on UV-initiated         graft polymerisation, led to the creation of 9 jobs at Water           Nano and sales of the small scale unit were in the order of 1.2M US$."
(Managing Director, Advanced Water Nano Ltd, Saudi Arabia)     Health impact is evidenced in the development of novel antibacterial         alginate therapeutics.
The development of AFM methods to study the       mechanical properties of cells and biofilms is being exploited in the       development of the next generation of antibacterial agents [R6].
Research       on the disruption of bacterial biofilms associated with cystic fibrosis by       alginate particles used AFM techniques in conjunction with microbiology,       rheology, particle characterisation and structural modelling, and was used       by the Norwegian company AlgiPharma to support the case for clinical       trials across Europe.
This led to further investment both from industry       and government for the development by AlgiPharma of a novel polymer         therapeutic (Oligo G) for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and chronic         obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
"The visualisation of OligoG on membrane surfaces has provided (and         will continue to provide) valuable evidence in support of the product         development, characterization, and funding for OligoG in human disease         [...] and in applications for biomedical device coatings.
OligoG is         currently in Phase IIa clinical trials for cystic fibrosis.
We currently         estimate that this research has facilitated the investment for further         research in AlgiPharma from the Norwegian Research Council and the UK         Technology Strategy Board in the region of &#163;7m"       (Research and Development Director, Sandvika, Norway.)
Membrane optimisation by surface characterisation was also exploited to       identify novel membranes for the process industries [R2, R3]       [RG3].
The novel membranes and their characterisation were used by PCI       Membrane Systems, now part of Xylem Inc. Xylem are a global supplier of       fluid technology and equipment for fluid processing, including water       management.
The membranes developed included two that have been supplied       globally on a large scale to the process industries since 1999.
Xylem Inc       have identified that the volume of sales continues with sales in the REF       period totalling &#163;500K for each membrane [Technical Manager Xylem Water       Services Ltd, Basingstoke, UK].
The emerging process of nanofiltration       reached a global market size of $310.5 million by 2012, contributing to a       market of established ultrafiltration technology that is in the US alone       currently worth $635 million.
