     Professor Joni Lovenduski and Dr Rosie Campbell are members of       influential networks of political       scientists of gender (including the Political Studies Association (PSA       UK), Women and Politics       Group and the ECPR Standing Group on Gender and Politics), where their       research, since first       publication in 1995, has had a significant, long-standing and far-reaching       impact on knowledge,       ideas and practices relating to women's party political representation and       voting behaviour.
(Sources 1,4,7,10) Working in collaboration with party officials and       activists who sought to increase       the representation of women in UK politics, their research has contributed       to a process which       resulted in the main political parties changing their policies on       candidate selection (e.g.
introduction       of All Women Shortlists, equality auditing of candidate selection       processes, training of selectors       and candidates) and attitudes to women voters (Sources 2,7,10).
The impact       has extended beyond       the UK to the EU, Italy, Poland, Estonia (Source 11) and beyond       policymakers, through the media,       to the general public.
Lovenduski and Campbell are regularly called upon       to contribute to policy       and advocacy discussions, public debates and media events in the UK, the       rest of Europe and       North America.
(Sources 6,12)     UK political parties and advocacy groups     Lovenduski's and Campbell's research is used by political parties and       parliament.
Fiona       Mactaggart MP wrote of Lovenduski `From the debates about that bill, where       her work was       referenced in the House of Commons Research Paper 2001 on Sex       Discrimination (Election       Candidates) Bill to more recent debates on parliamentary representation on       the floor of the House       of Commons on 12 Jan 2012 her work has underpinned many of the positive       changes we have       seen.
I was a member of the Speakers' conference on representation which       again depended       substantially on Joni's work, nearly all the major parties' submissions to       that body included       reference to her publications.'
(Source 5)     The utility of the research is exemplified by a number of recent       invitations.
In 2011 Lovenduski was       asked by the Policy Unit at 10 Downing Street to advise on sex equality       strategies and invited to       participate in the exchange of views on best practices for promoting       gender equality in political       parties at the Council of Europe in Paris.
In 2012 Campbell was invited to       join the Independent       Parliamentary Standards Authority's experts panel in its consultation on       MPs' pay and pensions.
On 17 December 2012 both advised the Liberal Democrat policy working group       on Political and       Constitutional Reform.
They were cited in the Speaker's conference report       on Political       Representation and Hansard.
Campbell and Lovenduski presented their       British Academy funded       research on MPs' roles at a House of Commons Library seminar on 16 May       2013.
In 2012,       Lovenduski was invited to make a keynote presentation on her research at       the International       Parliamentary Conference on Gender and Politics.
Jointly hosted by the       Commonwealth       Parliamentary Association UK and the British Group Inter-Parliamentary       Union, the       conference took place in the Houses of Parliament 6-8 November 2012, and       was attended by 60       international parliamentarians.
(Source 7)     Advocacy organisations and think-tanks have also used their research:            The Centre for Women and Democracy used it to identify and develop         practical strategies to         engage more women in politics and to substantiate their campaign work.
(Source 1)       The Vice-President of Rand Europe indicates that Lovenduski's work has         both shaped         research by the organisation and influenced her leadership role in it.
(Source 2)       The Fabian Women's Network (FWN) has used Lovenduski's and Campbell's         research to         inform their support and training programmes for women entering         political life.
They helped to         design FWN's innovative training and evaluation programme (2011-2013).
(Sources 3 and 9)       The Director of the Hansard Society writes, `Their work provides us         with the necessary         evidence base to address often widely help misconceptions and         misunderstandings about         women's political recruitment and representation, including among party         staff and the media,         and is something that we consequently turn to regularly in our political         and media engagement         work.
... Their work and support has therefore made a real difference to         the coalition's         approach.'
(Source 4)       The Fawcett Society published a short report (June 2013) on the         findings of Campbell's         research on gender and voting behaviour and has consulted her in its         pre-election strategy         meetings (2010 and 2015).
(Source 8)       Other organisations using their research include Equality and Human         Rights Commission and         Electoral Reform Society.
European impact     Lovenduski's and Campbell's research has acquired a reputation among       practitioners throughout       Europe generating frequent invitations for them to participate in policy       seminars and write reports.
Most recently,            Lovenduski was asked to advise on equality of representation policy by         the Council of Europe         Committee on Equality between women and men (December 2011), the EU         Social Affairs         directorate (2009) and L'Assemblea delle Donne per lo Sviluppo e la         Lotta all'Esclusione         (ASDO) programme in Italy (2008).
Lovenduski's work is cited and recommended in UN, International         Institute for Democracy and         Electoral Advantage (IDEA) and the IPU (InterParliamentary Union)         publications and on their         websites.
(Source 10)       In 2012, Lovenduski advised the Organisation for Security and         Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)         on candidate selection mechanisms and the impact of quotas.
She was         assessor of the         forthcoming OSCE Handbook, `Promoting Women's Leadership in Elected         Office'.
She was         also invited to speak at the International Parliamentary Conference on         Gender and Politics         hosted by the UK Parliament.
The OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights report, Gender           Equality in           Elected Office a Six Step Action Plan (2012) makes extensive         reference to Lovenduski's and         Campbell's work.
Impact on public discourse     Continuing from the early impact of Lovenduski's landmark research on       sexism in the House of       Commons, public debate on the behaviour of MPs remains active.
OpenDemocracy.net       commented, `Research by Joni Lovenduski bears out the notion that women's       presence connects       to policies that address women's concerns.
Lovenduski said that the `huge       debate' about sexual       abuse and violence against women could not have taken place without an       increase in women's       representation, along with the new policy focus on childcare, work/life       balance, single mothers or       improved equality legislation' (November 13, 2011).
In May 2013, the       Sheila McKechnie       Foundation, an influential charity connecting, informing and supporting       political campaigners,       invited Campbell to present her work.
Her presentation was podcast.
(Source 11)     There are frequent references to their research and requests for       interviews and advice by the       broadcast and news media.
Their work has been cited in papers such as The         Times, the Daily         Mail, The Economist and The Guardian, and they have       been interviewed on several editions of       Radio 4's Woman's Hour, Westminster Hour and Beyond         Westminster, as well as on national       television.
Campbell's work on attitudes and behaviour was used for       example in a special Analysis       programme on for BBC Radio 4 (Why Do Men and Women Vote Differently?
8/03 &amp; 14/03/2010).
