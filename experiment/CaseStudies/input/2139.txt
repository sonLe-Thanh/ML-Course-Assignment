     The research made eight key recommendations, which were developed       directly from the research       insights:            It is necessary to develop a non-pathological understanding of trauma         to manage         environmental disasters effectively.
Health, social care and voluntary organisations need to jointly review         what qualifies as a         disaster and how this is recognized, and develop ways of sharing         `intelligence' about needs.
Enhanced outreach working initiatives in rural areas would help         alleviate some of the ongoing         problems resulting from poor access during the disaster.
Agencies that employed front-line workers should make a record of         skills and expertise         acquired, and ensure ways to access this in future.
Positive regular mental health promotion for workforces should have         higher priority within the         larger organisations, and be available also for sub-contractors.
There should be a greater emphasis on guided de-briefing models and         peer support, rather         than stigmatising or pathologising approaches.
There should be greater community involvement in disposal site         management and contingency         planning more widely.
Post disaster regeneration support needs to be simplified, made more         accessible and have         less stringent/punitive eligibility criteria.
Through considerable dissemination of the research findings and the       recommendations made for       handling environmental disaster, there has been an impact both on the       efficacy of the management       of such crises (e.g.
through studies of subsequent crises) and on the       understanding at national and       international level of disaster management.
The latter includes direct       influence on the UK policy       framework for disaster management, and on the training provided to       relevant professionals.
The 2008 book has been a key element of international reach, with strong       hard copy sales for this       type of output (UK: 75; Export (ex N America): 50; and N America: 75).
The       book is also available       as an e-book via Palgrave Connect and e-book libraries.
A review in Environment         and Planning       (Vicente Rodriguez) concluded that the book was '...a valuable         contribution to the literature on         disasters'.
This is reflected in the fact that the book is held in       the Cabinet Office Library, and is       used as a training resource at the Emergency Planning College, a       governmental institution which is       part of the Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS) of the Cabinet Office.
Specifically, the book is       recommended reading on courses related to disaster planning, which train       private and public       sector workers from the UK and abroad on crisis management.
During the project Dr Convery gave briefings at DEFRA and the Department       of Health in London,       and on-going dissemination and contact with policy makers has led to       further influence, such as       the research informing the 2011 FMD Control Strategy (www.defra.gov.uk/publications/files/fmd-control-strategy111128.pdf).
The       research contributed directly to the understanding of social and       psychological factors and response capabilities through a "gradual         recognition and adaptation         taking a broader focus to control reflecting the complexity and with         positive improvements in our         approach that address some of the issues in [the FMD] research",       and "since the last major         outbreak in 2001 (and supported by your work) government recognises that         there are social and         economic impacts arising from any disease incidence...We are much more         aware of the social         impacts and the need to work through those trusted rural intermediaries         to provide support to reach         those farmers affected" (quoted from an acknowledgement from DEFRA       in an email from a Social       Researcher, Food and Farming Group, and member of the Advisory Group at       Defra, in an email to       Maggie Mort (May 2012).
The FMD research has also had influence at European level through the       CapHaz-Net Project       (http://caphaz-net.org/), a major EU       Framework Programme 7 research project in which       Lancaster University were a partner.
The project mapped and analysed       research with regard to       developing a better understanding of the social dimensions of `natural'       hazards and disasters.
The underpinning research helped to shape the initial project, and helped       frame the project as       assessing the social aspects of disaster management.
Dr Convery       contributed directly to the       project, through participation in the Social Capacity Building and Risk       Governance work package       workshop held at Lancaster University in 2009.
Cap-Haz has produced a       series of policy briefs in       relation to social capacity building in the management of natural hazards       in Europe.
There was also collaboration with The Institute of Rural Health in Wales       during 2002-2004 in       terms of arranging community conferences and meetings.
The research also       generated media       coverage: in early October 2005, coinciding with the publication of a       paper in the British Medical         Journal; there was intense media interest in the FMD research       (including online, radio, television       and newspaper coverage, national and international).
As an example, Dr       Convery was       interviewed by Radio Cumbria, Radio Wales, Nicky Campbell breakfast show       Radio 5 Live, ITV       Central and Border TV (all 7/10/05).
This aspect of dissemination has       helped to raise public       awareness of the social effects of such disasters.
The relevance of the research in terms of minimising and mitigating the       effects of such disasters is       shown in wider media interest and dissemination of the work.
Examples       include Dr Convery       participating in conference in Nova Scotia which specifically addressed       the issue of animal disease       in the North Atlantic region of Canada as an invited speaker (Convery,         I., (2007).
Animal Disease         and human trauma at the North Atlantic Biorenaissance Group, Nova       Scotia Agricultural College,       Canada, November 2007).
Dr Convery has also been interviewed on a number       of occasions by       local news organisations as an expert on disaster issues.
Most recently he       was interviewed by ITV       News (Borders) for their early evening news programme regarding the 2010       earthquake in Haiti.
The FMD research was also the subject of a Chinese State TV documentary in       2011, with both       researchers and participants interviewed for the film.
There are currently       plans for the 2008 book       (Convery et al.)
to be translated into Chinese and Korean.
The deposit of the research within the ESDS/UK data archive is seen as       highly successful, having       been reused and influencing training and seen as best practice in       collection and management of       data, including use by the UK Data Archive Data Management Team in       training (including       workshops and a forthcoming publication).The research approach has also       informed subsequent       disasters research, including a major Economic and Social Research       Council, Engineering and       Physical Sciences Research Council and Environment Agency funded research       project at       Lancaster University to investigate the 2007 Hull Floods (Whittle et         al.
(2010) After the Rain &#8212;         learning the lessons from flood recovery in Hull, final project       report for "Flood, Vulnerability and       Urban Resilience: a real-time study of local recovery following the floods       of June 2007 in Hull",       Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK) directly cites that the methodology       was derived from and       adapted the diary based approach from the FMD study.
This report included       recommendations to       include local consultation in flood management decisions in its response       to a related government       consultation, which resulted in the Flood and Water Management Act 2010,       and which includes       provision for Regional Flood and Coastal Committees to agree and enact       regional strategies.
The Hull Floods research, through the community approach which was based       on the FMD study,       has had a significant impact on UK policy for the management of       non-flooding disasters.
For       example, a member of the research team sits on the Community Resilience       Programme Steering       Group (active since 2009), thus enabling the project's findings to be fed       into the development of       the draft Strategic National Framework for Community Resilience and       research staff have       presented at the Cabinet Office Recovery Capability Board.
In this way the       FMD work was an       important first step in legitimizing participatory research approaches in       disaster management and       planning, and the uptake of community led approaches to management which       acknowledge the       social and emotional impacts of such events as key elements of recovery,       in addition to operational       and economic aspects.
