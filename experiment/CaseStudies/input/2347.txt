     Impact has been achieved through an iterative process informing and       informed by the policies and       practices of international institutions, national and sub-national       governments and individual       universities.
It has addressed the drivers:     (i) from regions seeking to mobilise universities in support of their       development goals; and     (ii) from within higher education for universities to engage with their       local communities.
It has also revealed the barriers to collaboration operating       within both domains and ways of       overcoming them, for example building more specific links between national       higher education,       science and territorial development policies.
In terms of reach, the OECD programme of reviews of Higher Education         in City and Regional         Development (2005-12) shaped by Goddard has involved university and       regional partnerships from       across the globe and embraced cities such as Berlin and Amsterdam, states       such as Victoria in       Australia, the Atlantic Province in Canada and Catalonia in Spain,       administrative regions in       centralised countries like the North East of England and Jyvaskyla in       Finland and less urbanised       regions such as V&#228;rmland in Sweden.
Individual regions and universities       have taken specific action       in response to the reviews.
For example V&#228;rmland notes:     "The conclusions and recommendations produced by the [OCED review]         have had great         significance for policy development of the triple helix collaboration in         V&#228;rmland...The         development of research collaboration between Region V&#228;rmland and         Karlstad University         is a direct result of the OECD project" (IMP1).
In terms of the significance, the reviews revealed barriers to fostering       collaboration within the       separate spheres of higher education and regional development policy.
Further, the work for the       OECD has influenced the European Commission such that the revised       guidelines for regional       policy are now more sensitive to the contribution that universities can       make to the Europe 2020       agenda of `smart, sustainable and inclusive growth'.
To underpin the role       of universities in a       process of regional smart specialisation (through which regions focus on       identifying and mobilising       their distinctive assets viewed in a global context), Goddard and Kempton       were commissioned to       prepare a practical guide Connecting Universities to Regional Growth       which has been endorsed by       Commissioners for both Education and Regional Policy (IMP2, IMP3).
National higher education agencies are already using this guidance.
For       example in a submission       on the revision of structural funds to the Welsh Assembly Enterprise and       Business Committee,       Higher Education Wales notes: "This shift [to a focus on interventions         which will have long term         and beneficial outcomes for the Welsh economy] is explicitly recommended         by the European         Commission itself in its landmark report `Connecting Universities to         Regional Growth" (IMP4).
Within England the CURDS team has facilitated the establishment of a       leadership group within the       Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to guide the design and       implementation of a       national smart specialisation strategy which includes strong       representation from higher education       (see Witty Review) (IMP5).
The Guide has also had an impact       outside of the EU having been       translated into Arabic and used to influence the establishment of 11 new       universities in Saudi       Arabia (IMP6).
In recognition of the fact that effective regional engagement will       require change within universities       the agenda has also been taken forward by the European Commission's       Directorate for Education       and Culture as part of its policy on `Modernising European Universities'.
The background policy       paper draws on the language of the Guide to note:     "...higher education institutions [should] become key partners for the         regional authorities in         formulating and implementing their smart specialisation strategies.
They         can contribute to         rigorous assessment of the region's knowledge assets, capabilities and         competencies,         including those embedded in the institution's own departments, as well         as local businesses,         with a view to identifying the most promising areas of specialisation         for a region, but also         the weaknesses that hamper innovation" (IMP7, IMP8).
To help embed this aspiration into practise the CURDS team has       facilitated a partnership between       the European Universities Association, which represents 850 universities,       and the Smart       Specialisation Platform established in the EU's Joint Research Centre to       support regions in       preparing and implementing their smart strategies (see information       at http://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/universities).
The partnership involves a network of universities       and regions working together to share best practice (IMP9).
The impact of the work has been further enhanced through the Commission's       annual Regio-Stars       award through which regions are invited to compete for recognition of       innovative regional projects.
In 2012 a new category `Connecting Universities to Regional Growth' was       established which       attracted 39 entries, more than any other category of award.
Goddard was a       juror and the finalist       regions all demonstrated the impact of the recommendations in the Guide (IMP10).
