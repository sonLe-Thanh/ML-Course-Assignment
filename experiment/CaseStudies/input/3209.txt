     The JAMA paper of 2002 had reported that although planned repeat       caesarean section was       associated with a lower risk of perinatal death during delivery, the       absolute risk of attempting       vaginal birth was lower than had previously been reported and was similar       to that of women in their       first pregnancy.
Prior to this publication, much higher absolute risks of       death had been used for       counselling (e.g.
see an editorial in NEJM 2001;345:54-55).
Following on from Smith's programme       of research, counselling both in the UK and internationally has moved to       quoting the much lower       rates reported first in the JAMA paper and confirmed in subsequent       analyses.
The direct influence       of Smith's work is demonstrated by his results in the JAMA paper being       extensively discussed in       the RCOG Guideline.
[1] The estimates of absolute risk from the JAMA paper       are presented in       Table 2 of the current US Guideline published in 2010.
[2] The Canadian       guideline published in       2005 devotes a full paragraph to summarising the results of this paper.
[3]       All three guidelines have       been current for all or part of the interval from 2008 to 2013.
The 2002 BMJ paper was the first to report an increased risk of perinatal       death among vaginally       delivered second twins at term in Scotland.
The 2007 paper confirmed that       the same association       was present in England and Wales.
The importance of Smith's research in       identifying the       increased risk for second twins is discussed in the NICE Guideline, CG132       Caesarean section       (2011).
[4]     The Lancet paper of 2003 had reported an increased risk of stillbirth       among women with a previous       caesarean section and as a result of this research, there has been a       widespread change in the       counselling of women considering delivery by caesarean section, as       evidenced by changes in       clinical guidelines.
For example, a whole paragraph is devoted to       describing the findings of this       paper in the 2011 NICE Guideline, CG132 Caesarean section (2011, page       180).
[4] Another       practical consequence of this research was that among women with a       previous caesarean section,       it became possible to predict that there would be a significant risk of       antepartum stillbirth       associated with a decision to have a vaginal birth.
Both the current RCOG       and ACOG Guidelines       comment on this risk.
[1,2] Although this was seen as controversial at the       time (see       correspondence in Lancet 2004;363:402), the prediction was subsequently       confirmed by a large       scale US study by the NICHD Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network (Landon       et al NEJM       2004;351:2581-2589).
The 2004 BMJ paper was the first to report an increased risk of perinatal       death due to uterine       rupture associated with induction of labour using prostaglandins.
These       findings are discussed in       detail in the current RCOG Guideline, Birth after previous caesarean       section (2007).
[1] A whole       pararagraph is devoted to the results of this study in the NICE Guideline,       CG70 Induction of Labour       (2008).
[5] The study has been less quoted internationally as different       prostaglandin preparations       tend to be used in North America.
