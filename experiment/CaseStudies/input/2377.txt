     This research has been widely disseminated in the healthcare and       architectural community.
Design strategy for the low-energy         ventilation and cooling of health buildings [1] received the RIBA       President's Commendation for `Outstanding University-based Research' 2009       with the following citation: "Its originality lies in the adaptation         and development of existing knowledge to meet the varied and demanding         requirements of large healthcare buildings.
The work is highly         significant, addressing strategies to meet the very demanding energy and         carbon reduction targets set for the healthcare sector."
[7]     The work has demonstrated to the NHS, and to other healthcare providers       worldwide (i.e.
Kaiser Permanente USA, 3DiFM India, SKANSKA Europe, Mercy       Health Australia), that very substantial energy savings are available       through design before the application of renewable technologies.
Moreover,       demonstrating the value in the existing building stock &#8212; particularly       heavier masonry pre-1945 buildings (such as Nightingale wards),       theoretically destined to be decommissioned &#8212; has helped to avoid       unnecessary demolition and rebuilding costs.
The NHS's Acting Director of the Estates &amp; Facilities Policy Division       comments: "This valuable research project ... demonstrated that the         existing estate is capable of being sustainably improved to achieve         levels of ventilation and cooling which will extend the estates         functional suitability for the foreseeable future... Cambridge         University's research [is] at the heart of government policy on making         the country resilient to climate change."
[8]     The former Director of Estates for Bradford Teaching Hospitals &#8212; where       the Royal Infirmary revised its position on Nightingales &#8212; comments: "As         a result of the DeDeRHECC findings, it is very reassuring to know that         Nightingale wards for instance, will be thermally resilient to 2080.
...         Of particular interest is how these wards might be used for geriatric         care, the patient group most at risk from overheating.
...I truly         believe this work is of international significance."
[12]     The CEO of Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children &#8212; and former CEO of       the West Herts NHS Trust &#8212; comments on the redevelopment of Watford       General Hospital: "This became the first NHS project to deliberately         factor in climate change implications... Short's team are now included         in the client team as advisors with whom successful tenderers would be         expect to consult...
In fact the Pro-Cure 21+ High Level Information         Pack &#8212; WHHT Transforms states, p 17, `The Trust is committed to         developing a sustainable hospital and is working with Professor Alan         Short ... to bring forward a hospital with very high levels of natural         ventilation.'"
[10]     (NHS ProCure 21+ is a six-year framework programme, 2010-16, being run by       the UK Department of Health to procure publicly funded capital schemes for       England's National Health Service.)
The work is also referred to in DEFRA's "Adapting to climate change:       national adaptation programme", [13].
Outside the UK, healthcare consortium Kaiser Permanente has used Short's       work to change regulation in the United States.
Its Chief Design Engineer       comments: "Regulation in the US currently prohibits natural         ventilation.
Several advocates have challenged that precedent in 2013.
The DeDeRHECC papers were influential references in this effort...
The         result: design engineers in the US may now choose natural ventilation in         non-patient and common areas of a hospital."
[11]     Short's work has also been taken up by Skanska, a major infrastructure       developer, whose Head of Sustainability comments: "Thanks to you         Skanska has been very well informed of leading edge thinking and         practice.
We have used this to help formulate our approach to hospital         developments, particularly in the UK, and also in Sweden and the US.
This work included the New Karolinska Hospital in Solna which has you         know has some impressive green credentials ..." [9] Most recently,       Short's research team has joined Skanka's design team for their bid for       the new Papworth Hospital project, advising on passive and assisted       ventilation, solar control, natural daylighting and building orientation       [9].
The winning bid has not yet been announced.
Dissemination of Short's       research was also supported via a 30-minute broadcast-quality project film       Robust Hospitals in a Changing Climate [14], released in April       2013, which was nominated for (in the assessment period) and won (out of       period) the 2013 tve Global Sustainability Film Award held at BAFTA.
The       film has been widely viewed, but its most tangible impact is perhaps the       new collaboration between Short and the Indian Ministry of Health and       Family Welfare.
The Managing Director of 3DiFM comments: "3DiFM is         working very closely with Prof Chandrashekhar, the Chief Architect to         the Govt.
of India's Department of Health and Family Welfare.
We have         introduced Prof Chandrashekhar to Prof Short and having reviewed the         DeDeRHECC film, he is very keen to collaborate with Prof Short and         Cambridge, in developing and applying the principle findings of         DeDeRHECC, to Indian hospitals."
[12]     Professor Chandrashekhar is now collaborating with Short in developing a       resilient prototype 200-300 bed hospital, to be the basis of over 600       hospitals planned by MoHFW across India, under the 19 May 2013 Memorandum       of Understanding between the UK DH and MoHFW.
