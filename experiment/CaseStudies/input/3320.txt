     The growing impact that the application of machine learning techniques on       data &#8212; `Big Data' &#8212; is having in society and the economy is profound, to       such an extent that it is impossible to quantify.
The key enablers of this       explosion have been:            The availability of reliable algorithms such as the various         generations of SVMs: research at Royal Holloway [3.2-3.6] has been         instrumental in the development of this technology, including string         kernels and conformal prediction.
The availability of open-source software, to which Royal Holloway         contributed the first open-source SVM implementation to be widely         available [3.1].
Education: the first accessible textbooks on SVMs were produced at         Royal Holloway, which are still at the source of course material that is         being developed today all over the world - for example, a specialist         course (http://www.is.titech.ac.jp/~shimo/class/fukumizu/)         at the University of Tokyo in 2010.
SVMs are a standard major topic in         introductory machine learning courses such as the two best-known on-line         machine learning courses in the world - "Learning from Data" (https://www.edx.org/course/caltechx/cs1156x/learning-data/1120)         course CS1156x from CaltechX presented on edX fall 2013, and Andrew Ng's         Machine Learning Course at Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/course/ml).
Among SVM open-source implementations available during the REF period are       those in R toolboxes, WEKA, and libsvm.
Examples of SVM implementations       that were commercially distributed within software suites during the REF       period are SAS Enterprise Miner (2011), Oracle Data Miner (2008) and       Avanade SQL Server Analysis Services (2012).
We now provide more concrete evidence that, during the REF period, SVMs       have been widely used in data analytics and embedded applications,       generating or enabling economic impact through improved products and       services in ways that can be directly linked to our research.
Economic impact: improved products and services; creation of new         business sectors     SVMs are widely used in big-data analytics, for example in: forecasting       of demand; credit scoring; detection of fraudulent transactions; spam       detection; and prediction of customer preferences.
Two examples of       successful companies that depend on SVMs for data analytics are:            Idalab GmbH [5.1], which uses SVM as their key technology, for market         research and business process risk analysis.
TWIMPACT [5.2], whose clients include advertisement and public         relations divisions of many high-tech companies worldwide.
SVMs are also used as embedded components of larger systems for       classifying images, events or machine states from sensor data.
These       applications are typically proprietary and confidential.
We therefore       present specimen patent applications as indirect evidence of widespread       impact because they show that companies are willing to spend money       protecting rights to inventions that work.
The following specimen examples       cite (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor 2000) and the preferred embodiments of       the inventions use SVM:            Patient state detection based on support vector machine based         algorithm (Medtronic Inc 2010, WO2010126625)       Diagnosis support system providing guidance to a user by automated         retrieval of similar cancer images with user feedback (Sti Medical         Systems Llc 2012, WO2012154216)       Systems and methods for detecting obstructions in a camera field of         view (Mobileye Technologies Ltd 2013, US8553088)       Method, array, and use thereof [for diagnosis of pancreatic cancer]         (Immunovia AB 2012, EP2490025)       Anomaly detection for link-state routing protocols (Telecom Italia         S.p.A. 2010, EP2235910)       Process of checking the presence of a grid pattern in an X-ray image         (Agfa Healthcare NV 2009, EP1696366)       Method for producing peptide libraries and use thereof (Sanofi Aventis         2009, EP2137658)       Radiation image processing method, apparatus, and program (Fujifilm         Corp. 2008, WO2008084880)       Support machine using iterative chunking and violators (Oracle Corp.         2011, US7937351)          Royal Holloway research on SVMs and kernel methods has also       contributed to the rise of a new business sector &#8212; the SVM was modified to       both learn from and to predict comparative preferences rather than       absolute values, so that a machine learning system could learn to predict       which retrieved items users would most like to see, and which possible       advertisements users would be most likely to respond to.
These techniques       are used in data retrieval, web search, and recommendation systems, with       global impact.
For example, the US patents [5.3] granted to Google Inc. are for a method       of automatically generating additional query suggestions to give       additional useful search results &#8212; for example, "car for hire" should be       extended with the query "car for rent" in the US.
These patents cite       eleven non-patent sources; of the six that were chosen by the inventors,       four are Royal Holloway publications: [3.5], [3.6], one paper by Kandola       et al, and another by Vinokourov et al.
String kernels in particular have influenced many fields.
Originally, SVM kernels were essentially smoothing operators for       multivariate data.
The impact of defining similarity by dynamic alignment       of matching scores instead of Euclidean distance was a new methodology for       developing application-specific kernels for many types of discrete data &#8212;       for example, in bioinformatics, natural language processing, time-series       and chemistry.
A letter from the Head of Google Research, New York [5.4]       describes the influence that [3.5] in particular had on research leading       to deployment of AT&amp;T's US-wide automated phone helpline.
Exemplary       patent applications making reference to [3.5] are [5.5] and [5.6].
Finally, sophisticated users are already starting to apply conformal         prediction &#8212; a supporting letter [5.7] describes its trial use for       generating reliable warnings of plasma instability in experimental fusion       reactors (the JET Tokamak at Culham, and the Stellarator at CIEMAT).
