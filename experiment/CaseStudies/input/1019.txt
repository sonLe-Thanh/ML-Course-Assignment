     Mothers offered an exemplary model for focusing on the family and       thereby enabling both families and carers to gain greater         understanding of sexual abuse trauma.
This then produced new         ways of training carers.

New understanding     The problem faced by Mosac was that the silence and taboo around familial       child sexual abuse hinder therapeutic support of families,       delaying appropriate social, health and legal interventions.
Mothers       established the first step towards impact by enabling the voice of the       families to be heard by social and health workers, teachers and policy       makers.
Victims and carers learnt how to break the silence.
As one       of the participating mothers said:     Doing the play, seeing it, it was like a funny way of counseling to         me....
It's made me look at things in a different way.
Whereas before         I'd have avoided looking at these issues, now I'd find a way of         addressing them.
It was a good way of dealing with it.
Seeing it acted         out like that.
(source B1)     Breaking the silence was a definable impact of Mothers, as Denise       Hubble, Mosac's Clinical Services Manager, explains:     The idea of addressing that which seems to `lie beyond words' is         something that is often discussed by my clients, and Mothers is         a direct aid in doing that.
We do not have another means of addressing         the `lies beyond words' as effective and sensitive as the play.
In that,         it is the most useful tool for communication we have ....
This play has       helped professionals and facilities gain a deeper insight into         how sexual abusers operate in our society ....
Most children do not         disclose ... that makes the need of finding a way to narrate the         experience all the more acute for social workers, caring professionals,         and policymakers as well.
We have found Mothers to be a helpful         tool with all these groups.
(source A1)     Piloted at Central with a Mosac audience (July 2007), Mothers was       performed in September 2007 at the Mosac AGM, a training forum for social       workers:     It gave me good insight into the experiences of these women, and other         women and children who are in similar circumstances....I think this play         would benefit anyone working with non abusing parents of sexually abused         children.
(source B2)     In May 2013 Mothers was the centrepiece (at the Pleasance,       Islington) of Mosac's awareness-raising week.
79% of the 491 who saw it       said it altered their thinking about the families affected       (sources B3 and B4).
A health care worker said:     It informed [her] further in [her] understanding of the mother's point         of view'.
Another said: `A valuable.... play/life story &#8212; I         believe that this is essential in being able to increase belief and         awareness of abuse'.
A teacher said `[It] makes you more aware         of a child's needs and signs.
It will make me work with caution and         compassion if I come across a family/child who has been affected by         sexual abuse (source B4).
Published for this event, the script remains in use by Mosac (source B5).

New training     Following specialist recognition of the efficacy of witnessbased drama,       the research insights were next used to develop training regimes for         nurses and social workers.
When Stuart Fisher discovered       that carers neglected their own experience she initiated       collaboration with the Florence Nightingale School of Nursing (KCL) to       develop and test (May 2011) a new form of nurse training, involving both       trainees and their tutors.
A subsequent workshop (January 2012) assembled       specialists from Barnardos, Camden Carers, Mosac, RHUL, UEL, Queen Mary,       and the Nightingale School.
For over 60% this training changed their         thinking about and approach to the practice of care (source B6).
Ian       Noonan, Programme Leader in Mental Health Nursing, said:     [the KCL workshop] gave the students the opportunity to see their         practice ... in a new way.
They were quite simply bowled over by the         process.
One student wrote ... "I realised for the first time         that I was struggling with competing feelings of compassion and         apprehension".
(source A2)     Building on the work with nurses, Stuart Fisher collaborated with the       Department of Social Work, RHUL, to create a new training programme       (delivered May 2012 and 2013).
Social workers who participated said it changed         their approach to child sexual abuse issues, with the effect that       they `think more about the persecutory nature in which we question or work       with non-abusing parents', `try to do more of what I know is important &#8212;       open mind &#8212; empathy' (source B7).
Anna Gupta, Head of Social Work, RHUL,       said:     The workshop has encouraged us to think differently about the way we         train social workers to support families affected by child sexual abuse         and the evaluations from students ... [suggest] that they too have         changed their perception towards support in child sexual abuse         situations.....a highly useful learning tool ... and one we could not         get from any other source (source A3).
