     Algorithms originally developed for recognising vehicles in security       situations [see Section 3, R1,       R2] are being used commercially to produce quantitative CT-based       biomarkers in oncology; the       tumour imaging biomarkers that have been created are: Heterogeneity,       Perfusion, Attenuation,       Size.
These are being used in clinical studies of historical medical       imaging data for risk       stratification, prognosis characterisation and treatment response.
The       research impact is very       wide-reaching in that it is applicable to colorectal, breast, lung,       prostate, oesophagus, renal,       gliomas and pancreatic cancers, as well as to other areas of medical       imaging.
The method and       technology were created by the underpinning research.
An initial patent       was filed in 2007, patent       0705223.6 [see Section 5, C1], and the algorithms and software       functionality developed over the       following four years.
The potential applications in patient prognosis, treatment and monitoring       led to funding from       medical sources.
The charity Prostate Cancer UK funded the inclusion of       patient prognostic reports       (2009-10), the then-Regional Development Agency, SEEDA, via       CommercialiSE-PoC, funded the       development of the software package, and the University's Enterprise       Development Fund       supported commercial development.
This was followed in February 2011 by       the incorporation of a       spin-out company, TexRAD Ltd, as a joint venture between the University of       Sussex, Imaging       Equipment Ltd, Cambridge Computed Imaging Ltd, and Miles Medical [C2].
The resultant software has been licensed to a number of hospitals in the       UK, Europe and the USA,       to be used to undertake medical studies and clinical trials These include:            the University of Mississippi Medical Centre, USA, which undertook         texture analysis on         computerised tomography (CT) images to validate the overall survival in         patients treated with         induction chemotherapy for cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
Andrew         D. Smith M.D.
Ph.D., Director of Radiology Research, has commented:       TexRAD software has allowed us to predict survival outcomes in several         different         tumors and treatment situations in a research setting.
The data         acquisition         process and analysis have been streamlined for large studies, and the         applications and support by TexRAD software engineers and leaders have         led to         some amazing results [C3].
University College London Hospitals, UK [C4] undertook analysis of the         CT component of a         combined positron emission tomography/computerised tomography (PET/CT)         to analyse         patient survival predictions for those with non-small-cell lung cancer.
Kings College, London, UK [C5] has undertaken several sets of work         looking at the texture         analysis of CT scans to determine patients' prognoses.
These include the         response to         tyrosine kinase inhibitors to metastatic renal cell cancer, 5-year         survival predictions of         primary colorectal cancer patients using whole-tumour texture analysis,         and survival         predictions for primary oesophageal cancer sufferers treated with         definitive chemotherapy         and radiation therapy.
Brighton and Sussex University Hospital NHS Trust, UK [C6] looked at         non-small-cell lung         carcinoma and texture variations as a survival predictor.
The Department of Clinical Engineering, Aarhus University Hospital,         Skejby, Aarhus,         Denmark, are conducting a 100-patient study into non-small-cell lung         carcinoma and texture         variations as a survival predictor [C7].
As a result of the trials detailed above and fourteen others, over 50       refereed journal and       conference papers have been disseminated, including papers in Radiology       and Clinical Cancer         Research [C8].
The effect of these findings is to validate the use       of the algorithms in the prediction       of the survival and treatment response of patients with squamous cell       carcinoma of the head and       neck, non-small-cell lung cancer, renal cancer, oesophageal cancer and       colorectal cancer.
On a commercial front, Pfizer are conducting a 400-patient       renal-carcinoma drug-response study       at The University of Mississippi Medical Centre, USA; the results are due       around May 2014.
The TexRAD software has workstation, server and cloud-based versions,       with research licence       sales to 31 July 2013 of &#163;172k [C2].
The clinical evidence generated was       sufficient for the first       stage of the FDA (USA) and CE (Europe) approvals process for clinical use       to start in December       2012 and the TexRAD software is expected to gain ISO-13485 quality and       FDA/CE approval in       2014.
TexRAD's texture analysis is a relatively inexpensive and simple process       by which tissue       abnormalities, and hence prognosis, treatment plans and response to       treatment, can be monitored       and acted upon without invasive procedures or further images being       required.
The significance has       been recognised by clinicians and, in turn, by those with commercial       interests.
Consequentially,       TexRAD Ltd is currently in discussions in relation to substantial       investment.
