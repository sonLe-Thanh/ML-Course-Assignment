     Each Botanics event has involved primary school pupils (200-300 per show)       from areas of significant deprivation within the City of Edinburgh.
For       The Quicken Tree (2011), for example, the three schools taking part served       the 15% most deprived areas of the City, with Pilton serving one of the       15% most deprived areas of Scotland.
Children from these schools live in       areas with very high levels of unemployment and local neighbourhood crime       and low levels of educational achievement.
The value of this project to the community is reflected in the investment       of various trusts and charities in production costs; The Quicken Tree,       for example, cost &#163;60,000 to develop and stage.
It was supported       financially by the University of Edinburgh, Lanvern Foundation, Robertson       Trust, Creative Scotland, D'Oyly Carte, Robin Leith Trust and the Thornton       Foundation.
Its primary benefit is for the children taking part.
Following the final       public performances of each show, the University of Edinburgh Music in the       Community students involved have continued to work with the school pupils       for a further 12 months in order to sustain and develop further the skills       and interests arising from the performance project, thus helping to       achieve an enduring legacy for the schools.
The benefit of this activity       is that prolonged engagement with the arts as a tool for learning helps       the participating children gain confidence and self-esteem, becoming       better able to concentrate and apply themselves across all learning areas,       and to express themselves and communicate with others more effectively.
In       the words of the headmaster of one of the schools which has been involved:     "Community music should be available on the National Health Service,         it should be an entitlement for communities to have music ... it makes         such a difference ... [Community music] is the yeast in the dough ...         [it] lifts you above the nitty gritty and takes you out of yourself and         makes you really believe in yourself ...
It is worth a thousand bottles         of antidepressants, and there is just not enough of it.
It is a         wonderful wonderful thing and children learn things from [community         music] which help them with ... maths and language and social studies.
They learn to focus, they learn to listen, they learn lower order         thinking skills like memory ... but they also learn the highest order         thinking skill of creativity.
They learn to create something and that         helps them across the curriculum.
[Community Music] is just so important         when education is being cut ... when music specialists are rare ... when         this is happening music in the community is vital and I am terrified         that it is just going to fade away ... Every school across the globe         would benefit from this."
(See 5.1)     The project also benefits the primary school teachers involved, through       its provision of a programme of music-based continual professional       development, and parents, by providing experiences that help them see the       capacity of their children in a new light.
For the National Museum of Scotland event in 2012, The City Sings,       an independent report was commissioned which used observation,       questionnaires and interviews to evaluate the impact of the show on the       participants&#8212;the children, the teachers, the participating students and       the wider community.
Evidence was gathered on the effects of the work on       children's personal and social development&#8212;their confidence, social and       team building skills and aspirations; on the importance of the musical       skills and expertise of the music in the community practitioners; on the       importance of partnerships; and on the effectiveness of the professional       development involved and its contribution to the delivery of the       expressive arts component of the Curriculum for Excellence:     "Active learning is always very, very important and for [the children]         to be actively involved in areas of the curriculum where teachers don't         always have expertise is just a phenomenal opportunity.
For [the         children] to have role models with the confidence and expertise and         obvious talent to work with the children has just changed the children's         ideas about music, about singing, about live performance... it has made         their studies much more engaging."
P5 teacher     "The City Sings was a great production and my family said "that was         amazing!"
I am sure that this experience has brought back all my         confidence."
(P5 pupil)     "At the end of the performance the parents were saying that they         didn't think their child would ever be able to do that kind of thing.
It         has had a very, very positive effect on the school."
(P6 teacher)     "As far as the Curriculum for Excellence is concerned [The City Sings]         hits all four elements: confident individuals, responsible citizens...         successful learners and effective contributors."
(P4 teacher)     (all quotes from 5.2)     Overall, these events demonstrate the transformative power of the arts as       a means of social and behavioural change while generating significant       interest in and awareness of the pleasure of participation in the arts in       schools, amongst parents and within the children's wider communities.
