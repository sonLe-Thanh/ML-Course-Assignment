     MERI's HIPIMS research has achieved three streams of economic impact:       roll out of HIPIMS surface pre-treatment methods through coating system       manufacturers; direct collaboration with product manufacturers; and       discipline leading activities associated with the joint SHU-Fraunhofer       HIPIMS Research Centre.
Economic impact by roll out of HIPIMS surface pre-treatment methods           and other patents     In parallel with their academic research and publications, Ehiasarian and       Hovsepian have developed a portfolio of patents to protect the IP in their       HIPIMS innovations.
Commercially, the most important of these has proved       to be EP1260603B1 [A] (filed 2001, granted 2006, validated in 12 EU       states), relating to the HIPIMS surface pre-treatment stage in the coating       production process [1].
This patent has been monetised by equipping       coating systems with special (licensed) modules that deliver the       pre-treatment described in [A].
MERI's HIPIMS pre-treatment technology has       been licensed non-exclusively in this way to four leading PVD coating       system manufacturers: Ionbond AG (Switzerland) [C]; SVS Vacuum         Coating Technologies GmBH &amp; Co (Germany); Hauzer Techno         Coating AG (The Netherlands) [D]; and CemeCon AG (Germany).
This has achieved two classes of beneficiary: the coating system       manufacturers, whose systems have been enhanced through incorporation of       the MERI module; and system purchasers, who have acquired the capability       of producing enhanced components.
HIPIMS technology has become a key       activity of Hauzer Techno Coating (~200 employees) [D] and CemeCon       in the REF impact period.
Licence revenue paid to SHU (at a rate of &#8364;50k for entry to the programme       and &#8364;25k for each sale or retrofit of a coatings system) explicitly links       the system manufacturers and purchasers to the research described in section         2.
In the REF impact period, six licensed systems have been       manufactured and two more retro-fitted.
These have generated more than &#163;5m       of sales to the manufacturer beneficiaries and &#163;238,089 of         licence income to SHU.
All licences (including those established       before the REF period) will run through to expiry of the patent [A] in       2021.
As a result, the operators of ten coating systems have been beneficiaries       in the "system purchasers" sense over the REF impact period.
Ehiasarian       and Hovsepian have no direct interaction with the "system purchasers", so       their specific uses of HIPIMS, and the associated sales figures, are in       commercial confidence.
However, typical applications are known to include       wear and oxidation-resistant coatings for automotive engine components,       resulting in longer lifespans and higher operating temperatures, and       special coatings for dry high-speed machining tools, which yield enormous       improvements in cutting-tool lifetimes and machining speeds.
Each of the       ten HIPIMS systems equipped with the MERI surface pre-treatment stage has       the capacity to produce &#163;10+m of components per year.
Systems have been       operating on two shifts per day to produce a range of high-value       components [C,D].
In 2006 a further patent application was made to protect bias power       supply designs developed within an industrial collaboration.
This was       granted in the UK (GB0607269B) and China (CN101461032B) [E] and remains in       application stage in Europe, Korea and Japan.
It is co-owned by SHU, Hauzer         Techno Coating [D] and Huettinger Electronic Sp z.o.o.
[F],       with Ehiasarian and Hovsepian the leading inventors.
This technology was       commercialised in 2010, the two industrial co-owners retaining       manufacturing and sales rights.
Within the REF impact period, it has       resulted in power supply unit sales exceeding &#163;1m (beneficiaries Hauzer,       Huettinger and their clients) and licence income to SHU of       &#163;15,181k.
Later patent filings by Ehiasarian and Hovsepian cover aspects such as       differing coating types and technical advances such as high rate       deposition, rare metal ion etching and inductively coupled etching.
These       have not earned any income in the REF impact period, but have been       maintained within the overall IP portfolio due to their continued       commercial potential.
Economic impact by direct collaboration with product manufacturers     Within the second impact stream identified above, Ehiasarian has       delivered or started delivering collaborative and/or licensed research to       a series of large manufacturers.
In each case, the manufacturer is a         beneficiary through enhancements made to their products.
These       include large licence contracts with Mahle (&#163;50k)       [vi] and Biomet (&#163;100k pa for three years) [ix] to develop       coatings for automotive piston rings and metal-on-metal hip implants,       respectively.
Additional collaborations yielding economic impact         through product enhancement include:            a &#163;100k project funded by OC Oerlikon Balzers (2006-10), to         develop HIPIMS coating deposition technology to allow writing of         miniaturised 3D-Integrated microelectronics devices.
The company has         integrated this capability into its Clusterline 200 system, a         multi-stage coating machine, leading to sales exceeding &#8364;20m;       a 2008-11 collaboration with the Space Science Technology Department         of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) [vii], through which         coatings developed by the Ehiasarian group overcame a long-standing         issue with RAL's cryo-coolers for satellite applications.
This work led         to the satellites being judged flight worthy and superior to competitor         technologies [G];       a 2011 collaboration with The Gillette Company (USA) which         resulted in a granted patent (US7966909B) [H] for a new HIPIMS-based         process for manufacturing razor blades with high aspect ratio cutting         edge and, therefore, improved shaving properties.
The patent is the         property of Gillette with Ehiasarian and Hovsepian listed as named         inventors;       a 3-year (from 2013) research and development contract with Rolls           Royce to develop HIPIMS technologies appropriate to aero-engine         turbine blades [J].
Economic impact through discipline leading activities     The symbiotic joint SHU-Fraunhofer HIPIMS Research Centre provides       technical and infrastructural benefits to both partners.
The resultant       "critical mass" of HIPIMS expertise encompasses the capability needed both       to deliver large projects and also to support strategic industrial       development programmes in the UK, Germany and worldwide.
This has resulted       in a large EPSRC-supported collaboration on high efficiency solar-cell       glass panels [viii] with Pilkingtons (UK), Gencoa (UK) and       Von Ardenne (Germany).
The Joint Centre has also started to deliver       HIPIMS expertise to other companies such as Bosch and DOT GmbH,       Germany [B].
Since the prime function of the Fraunhofer IST is KT       and technology transfer, it can be viewed as a beneficiary under       REF impact, as can the collaborating industrial partners.
A further broadening of the MERI HIPIMS group's impact relates to the       discipline-leading activities through which it has expanded the field of       HIPIMS and, in particular, its industrial uptake.
This expansion has       stimulated the development of a network of sub-system and component       providers who are a final group of beneficiaries.
This includes       providers of analytical equipment, specialist power supplies and magnetron       systems and targets.
This network is demonstrated by, for example the ~20       industrial exhibitors at the 2012 and 2013 annual International       Conferences on HIPIMS [K] run by MERI and the Fraunhofer IST.
