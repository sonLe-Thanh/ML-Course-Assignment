     We provide evidence that the research as cited in s2 and s3 has delivered       3 major impacts.
It has: fundamentally changed understanding of Bipolar       Disorder in professional and lay audiences; changed treatment in terms of       policy and practice, including NICE clinical guidelines; and changed       professional training delivered both nationally and internationally.
Impact 1 &#8212; Changing Understanding     Our research-based model of a psychological approach to bipolar disorder       is summarised in a key document commissioned by the British Psychological       Society called "Understanding Bipolar Disorder: Why some people experience       extreme mood states and what can help" (5.1).
This document was written       for a general audience, has been widely accessed (downloaded 4793 times;       as of 30/7/2013), has been very positively reviewed by the national       service user Bipolar organisation (5.2), and been celebrity endorsed       (described on twitter as "fascinating" by Stephen Fry 06/09/2011).
We have further influenced the psychological understanding of Bipolar       Disorder in the general public in the following ways:     i.
Maintaining a confidential database of people with bipolar experiences       interested in our research (Spectrum Connect, 516 members) with regular       research updates, and including a full day conference for Spectrum Connect       members (50 participants 19/09/2012).
ii.
A series of debate-changing media events which have reached large       audiences, including Radio 4, the Guardian and Radio Lancashire (5.3).
iii.
Disseminating our clinical research findings through our website www.spectrumcentre.org (28,506       page views in 12 months to 31/07/13) social media including twitter       (@SpectrumCentre &#8212; 835 followers), and Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/thespectrumcentre - 211 members).
Impact 2 &#8212; Changing Treatment (policy and practice)     We have developed and evaluated a range of psychological interventions,       aiming to ensure people have choice depending on needs and preferences.
We       have conducted 6 trials of psychological therapies for people with BD       since 2008, including individual face to face treatment, online self-management 	  packages, and group therapy programmes.
Some 700 people have       been recruited, of whom over 500 have received a psychological treatment       as a direct result of the trials (as of 25/07/2013) via the Recovery       Programme and PARADES Programme (3.3-3.6, 5.4, 5.5).
The popularity of the       group psychoeducation approach (3.6) in our PARADES programme among       service users and clinicians has led to Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS       Trust including this in their plan for mainstream clinical care (5.6).
All       our work is carried out with extensive user involvement to ensure it is       acceptable, user friendly and targets their valued outcomes.
Our PARADES       programme was shortlisted for (and came second) in the MHRN national       service user involvement awards (2010) and both our PARADES       psychoeducation trials and our Recovery trial are referred to by MHRN as       good practice case studies (2011; 5.7).
Jones currently sits on the expert panel writing the revised NICE       guideline (5.8; publication due 2014) and Lobban represents the British       Association of Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy (BABCP) providing       expert input to the NICE guideline process (5.9).
Research we have       completed at Spectrum, specifically around relapse prevention (3.3),       recovery focused CBT (3.4) and web-based support (3.12) is being reviewed       and will determine clinical recommendations.
Our work in reducing carer's       distress has been included in the recent draft NICE Guideline for       Psychosis (http://bit.ly/1gtOjLG).
Impact 3 &#8212; Changing Professional Training     Even when treatments are recommended by NICE, there is a national problem       of access.
People with mental health problems on average wait up to 2       years for talking therapies.
The IAPT programme aims to improve access and       now includes bipolar disorder in recognition of the even greater delay for       this population.
As a direct result of our research, individual CBT (3.4),       relapse prevention (3.3) and group psychoeducation (3.6), are now all       recommended for people with Bipolar Disorder and are part of core       competencies for NHS staff delivering psychological therapies to those       with bipolar disorder (5.10, 5.11).
Spectrum was selected by the IAPT       programme to work in collaboration with Birmingham and Solihull Trust as       the only UK demonstration site for development of IAPT services for       Bipolar Disorder (Nov 2012 - Nov 2014).
This good practice demonstration       site specifically cites the research of our team (5.12).
Based on our research (3.3-3.6) and in addition to the IAPT programme we       have been invited to give a series of national and international training       events training approximately 1040 clinicians across 16 clinical workshops       in the US, Norway and UK to deliver psychological interventions (5.13).
Directly within the research trials we have trained 87 clinical staff in       the delivery of individual face to face therapies.
The PARADES Group trial       has trained 10 health professional group facilitators and 9 service user       facilitators for Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust.
Thus we have       impacted on the clinical practice of a significant number of       practitioners.
