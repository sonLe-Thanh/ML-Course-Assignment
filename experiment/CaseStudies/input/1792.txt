     The work by Rudge and Gilchrist has been used as evidence on the health       effects of fuel poverty by consumer and advisory groups, NHS groups, UK       central and local government and various overseas organisations.
As such,       it has influenced the decisions of a wide variety of government and health       authorities, and informed the public debate on fuel poverty and poor       housing.
