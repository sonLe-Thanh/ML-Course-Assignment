     Implementation of our research through BARCIK     Since the conference launch of the BARCIK network in 1998, Sillitoe has       continued to advise and       support BARCIK on policy and strategy (Sources 1 and 2) throughout the REF       period.
Using our       research insights and methods, BARCIK moved from IK advocacy to direct       interventions using IK       in agriculture and fishing to improve food security for the poor (Source 3       and 4).
In addition to using       Outputs 1-5, many of BARCIK's IK interventions have relied on a key impact       to pathway: Sillitoe,       P., Dixon P. &amp; Barr J.
(2005) Indigenous Knowledge Inquiries: A         Methodologies Manual For         Development, London: Intermediate Technology Publications.
This       rendered Durham's IK research       into a usable tool set for practitioners.
BARCIK's Director noted that "BARCIK         staff regularly draw         on the principles and methods outlined in ... [Sillitoe's] research and         publications, notably his IK         Inquiries handbook which many of us find inspirational.
His approach has         been fundamental to our         success in promoting and applying indigenous knowledge...[and in] our         action research projects on         `climate change adaptation by traditional means', `Local biodiversity         based farmer-led research for         sustainable agriculture', and `Applied research on saline tolerant, deep         water and drought tolerant         local rice varieties'".
Referring to Output 3, he added that "The         book [Durham researchers] edited         ... from that meeting continue[s] to motivate IK work in Bangladesh"       (Sources 1 &amp; 2).
The manual       and Outputs 3 and 4, were all translated into Bangla.
This has contributed       hugely to their       enthusiastic and extensive uptake.
As an organisation, BARCIK thrives.
It       now has 125 full-time       and 20 part-time volunteers.
An extensive field audit of BARCIK's work in 2011 (Source 5) provides       strong independent       evidence for the effectiveness of BARCIK's impact during the REF period.
The report was       commissioned by MISEREOR, the German Catholic charity, who donated &#163;666k       in the period to       BARCIK for 7 projects including conservation, climate change and green       village initiatives and       carried out by FAKT (www.fakt.consult.de).
The report examined impacts from interventions in 4       villages before 2008 and in 5 villages after 2009 (Source 5 p8), noting       that "BARCIK is ... active in         14 ... agro-ecological zones of Bangladesh' reaching "a great         variety of different farmers, fishers,         forest dwellers and landless people" (p6).
The audit states that 14       villages (14,800 people) had       taken up IK knowledge exchange practices promoted by BARCIK in 2011 (p11)       and that ' (A)n         alternative way of doing agricultural development combining modern         technology and the         indigenous knowledge and practices of ... people has been found to be         effective in increasing         farmers' productivity."
(Source 5: p4), demonstrating the influence       of our innovative call to merge       IK and scientific technology (Output 1).
For example, farmers' knowledge about local rice varieties and their       cultivation was effective in       mounting resistance to the promotion of monocrop, high yield cultivars       which are expensive, rely       on fertilisers and weedicides, and rapidly exhaust soil productivity       (Source 5).
As one BARCIK-supported       farmer put it: `Earlier we had only 3 or 4 types of seeds, but now we         have 60 or 70 ...         Officers from the Agricultural Department of the Government appreciated         the works of BARCIK         saying that what they couldn't do, BARCIK has done.
We have learnt how         to preserve seeds         properly from BARCIK... We have learnt about the dry seedbeds of paddy         and now we can plant         much younger ... saplings that give us better yields.
Whereas earlier we         used to plant saplings of         2-3 months that resulted in premature harvesting with less yields.'
(Source 4).
This impact is       corroborated by a BARCIK co-ordinator: Following (Sillitoe's) research         we sought to show how       jhum (local shifting cultivation systems) vary widely and feature         complex natural resource         management strategies ' (Source 3).
The MISEROR report concluded that "BARCIK has contributed to higher         food security and less         vulnerability of poor farmers...
The status of women has improved...         Farmer-to-farmer         relationships have improved."
and noted: "There were many social         effects ...on accessing         government support, and ...much multiplication, spreading sustainable         farming practices to many         more villages.
There was also news coverage ... that led to more         awareness" (Source 5: p24).
Training Bangladeshi NGO practitioners     Beyond BARCIK, our research has informed Bangladeshi university curricula       for training a new       generation of local NGO practitioners: IK-aware strategies are now       integral to the preparation of       NGO workers for the field: `... they found it [Sillitoe's approach]         very inspiring .., many students         have gone through them [Manual guidelines].
His work in ethno-science         has been particularly         helpful to us on the food security programme where we have made much use         of the methodologies         that he gives in his books.
For instance in researching and promoting         local crop varieties         threatened by the HYVs (high yield varieties) of the green revolution         which are proving         unsustainable and damaging to our country's natural resources...'       (Source 6).
Impact beyond Bangladesh     Work extending and implementing our IK research in Bangladesh continued       with UNESCO (Social       &amp; Human Sciences Sector) funding from its Local &amp; Indigenous       Knowledge Systems Programme       (LINKS) for a project entitled `Documentation and application of       indigenous knowledge in Charan,       Bangladesh' (2002-7).
Within the REF period, Durham's research       publications continue to inform       the LINKS programme: "we recommend (Indigenous Knowledge Inquiries)         to our...project partners         around the world as a valuable guide to ways to work with indigenous         knowledge" (Source 7).
