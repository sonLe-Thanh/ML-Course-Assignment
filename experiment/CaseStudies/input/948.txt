     The pathway to impact of Dr Whyte's research for The Causes of the         ICL Disaster started with a Scottish Parliament Motion       congratulating the authors for the research, introduced to the Parliament       on 4th September 2007.
Dr Whyte's recommendations in the report on       corporate accountability (see section 2 above) led directly to his being       contacted by Dr Bill Wilson MSP, and then, following a series of meetings       in the Scottish Parliament in 2008 and 2009, led to Dr Whyte's engagement       in a collaborative project with Dr Wilson to develop legislative proposals       for improving corporate accountability.
As a result of this collaborative       project Dr Whyte authored the first draft of the Criminal Sentencing (Equity         Fines) (Scotland) Bill (SB 10-54) and co-authored the       statutory parliamentary consultation document that accompanied this Bill.
The Bill was introduced and debated at the committee stages of the       Scottish Parliament on the 1st June 2010.
Part of the Bill was       considered to be a matter reserved for the Westminster Parliament, and       part was subsequently passed as an amendment to the Criminal Justice and       Licensing (Scotland) Bill on 6 August 2010.
The UK Parliamentary impact of A Crisis of Enforcement is       indicated by its presentation at a House of Commons meeting sponsored by       the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies and chaired by Katy Clark MP, 18th       June, 2008 to discuss Dr Whyte's research findings in publication 3 cited       above.
This meeting led to a House of Commons Early Day Motion on the       findings of the report (EDM 1855, 26th June 2008).
The same       project also led to a further House of Commons Early Day Motion tabled by       Katy Clark MP which cited findings of the report (EDM 632, 18th       January 2010).
The UK Policy Impact of A Crisis of Enforcement is indicated by       the regular citation of its research findings.
Director of Public       Prosecutions, Kier Starmer, at international conference on Corporate         Criminal Liability in London, 19th September 2009 cited       publication 3 listed in section 3 above.
Publication 5 listed above was       the subject of a public debate on the findings of the research between Dr       Whyte and David Ashton, HSE Director of Field Operations (IER Conference,       Adelphi Hotel, Liverpool, 13th July 2010); and a formal       response to the research findings in publication 4 was presented by the       Chief Executive of the Health and Safety Executive to the Health and       Safety Board, 28th July, 2010.
Dr Whyte's research findings       also led directly to an invitation to give oral and written evidence to       the L&#246;fstedt Review, a panel appointed by the Prime Minister to review       health and safety legislation in 2011.
Significant impact upon NGO and trade union movement policy work is       indicated by a clear pathway that begins with a high level of knowledge       exchange in the trade union movement.
This knowledge exchange began with       mass dissemination of publication 4 cited above.
This included large scale       purchases of book by UNISON (200 copies) and GMB (500 copies) for       distribution to members.
This dissemination activity led directly to a       number of invitations to give keynote speeches at national events       organised by UCATT, UNISON and GMB, as well as the following high profile       keynote and plenary speeches in other labour movement fora:       keynote speech to the annual Hazards Conference, 10th July       2010, Keele University; plenary debate with Professor L&#246;fstedt, Chair of       the panel appointed by the Prime Minister to review Health and Safety       legislation (at the IER conference, What Now for Health and Safety At         Work?
NUT London, 9th May 2012); keynote panel speech to the annual       Hazards Conference, 1st September 2012, Keele University; and       plenary address to IER conferences `Health and Safety at Work' (UNITE       Building, London 12th June, 2013 and Adelphi Hotel, Liverpool,       3rd July 2013).
This large volume of KE work led to the direct application of Dr Whyte's       research findings in trade union policy and campaigns.
Four key examples       of this impact are listed here.
First, GMB's response to the Coalition       Government's Review of Health and Safety Legislation The Young Review       draws extensively on publication 3 listed above.
Second, the Trade Union       Co-ordinating Group, the main parliamentary lobbying group of the trade       union movement, used publication 3 as the key source for a chapter of the       briefing paper for its nine constituent unions, Big Society, Savage         Cuts.
Third, the IER has used Dr Whyte's research findings from this       research as the primary source for its parliamentary lobbying work on       health and safety rights over the past 3 years.
Dr Whyte authored the       following IER papers as part of this lobbying work: a briefing on The         Young Review distributed to MPs and senior trade union officials; a       response to the Law Commission's Consultation Paper Criminal Liability         in Regulatory Contexts, subsequently published in the New Law         Journal (`Corporate or criminal?'
Issue 7449, January 2011); and a       response to the government's Triennial review of the Health and Safety       Executive, July 26th 2013 (to be published in Safety         Management, the magazine of the British Safety Council, early 2014).
He also made a key contribution to an IER briefing commissioned by Ian       Lavery MP in response to the Draft Deregulation Bill, November 2013.
Fourth, Dr Whyte's work is used by the International Labour Office (ILO)       as the key authority on workplace safety regulation and enforcement in the       UK, as evidenced by its extensive citation in a 2011 ILO report on Labour       Inspection in the UK.
