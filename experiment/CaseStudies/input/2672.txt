     Much of the impact of Fisher's book, Winterreise (commissioned       for an exhibition, The Pilgrimage         Books, curated by Sheila Farrell for Worcester City Art Gallery and       Worcester Cathedral as part of       a larger, Arts Council England-funded multi-arts project in partnership       with BBC Radio Drama)       occurred prior to 2008.
It culminated, however, in production of a signed       single edition digital       facsimile, also bound by Tracey Rowledge, for permanent display in The       Hive, Worcester's new       multi-award winning University and public library opened in July 2012.
The       book is presented       alongside two paintings by Fisher (see details later in this section).
An       image of the original book       was reproduced in RA Magazine (Issue 110, Spring 2011,       circulation: 10,000), alongside an article       on the 2011 London Original Print Fair (which discussed the variety of       forms embraced by       contemporary print making), during which Fisher participated in a workshop       for visitors.
Mono prints from Fisher's series This is How I Walk When I Have Given         Up, together with his       paintings Her Image Will Also Melt Away, You Won't Hear my Step,         Beyond Ice and Night and         Fear, I Quaked Like the Ague, Eat the Quids, Delirium         Warms, and Lindenbloom were exhibited as       part of Fisher's 2008 solo exhibition: I Came Here a Stranger,       Eagle Gallery, Emma Hill Fine Art,       London.
Mono prints and the paintings My Hopes Are Not Entirely         Hopeless, The Air of Highland         Mary, Wide Awake Hat and Oh He Shams were also       included in a second, linked solo exhibition,       As A Stranger I Depart, Campden Gallery Gloucestershire.
Together,       these exhibitions attracted       1,260 visitors.
They were accompanied by a catalogue, I Came Here a         Stranger as a Stranger I         Depart (ISBN: 978-0-9554046-6-5) distributed in an edition of 5,000,       with texts by Fisher and       Martin Holman and illustrations of a number of the paintings discussed in       this case study.
These       exhibitions, and the painting Beyond Ice and Night and Fear were       featured in the editorial for       Galleries magazine (November 2008), distributed throughout the UK       in monthly editions of 17,000.
The painting Lindenbloom was exhibited in Exchange (also       including work by Basil Beattie, Jane       Bustin, Zara Matthews and Peter Rasmussen), The Paul Kane Gallery, Dublin,       30th March &#8212; 19th       April 2008.
Exchange was featured on `The View' programme, RTE       television, 8th April 2008       (http://www.rte.ie/tv/theview/archive/20080408.html)       and reviewed by Aiden Dunne in The Irish         Times, 9th April 2008: "[...] Finally, James Fisher's       richly-coloured paintings present us with       deceptive surfaces.
Appropriated imagery is infiltrated into layer upon       layer of decorative patterning       &#8212; or vice versa.
The basic effect is to make us question what we are       looking at as the illusion of the       picture surface gives way no matter which way we try to read it.
Having       been diverted, however,       we are endlessly entertained by Fisher's juxtapositions of line, pattern       and colour.
If you are used       to thinking of contemporary British art purely in terms of the YBAs, this       show should come as an       interesting corrective."
Exchange attracted some 1,250 visitors;       RTE's `The View' programme       attracted an audience of 76,000; the Irish Times has a daily adult       readership of 321,000.
All the paintings and the entire suite of mono prints were also presented       in a solo exhibition as part       of the 2009 Aldeburgh Festival, at the invitation of composer and       Aldeburgh Festival Associate       Artistic Director John Woolrich.
Presented at the Pond Gallery, Snape       Maltings My Hopes are not         Entirely Hopeless was open throughout the 2009 Festival, which       attracted audiences of 21,000.
Fisher gave an invited talk at Peterborough Museum and Art Gallery, Painting         in the Footsteps of         John Clare in December 2010, during which he discussed some of the       work stemming from       research outlined in the case study.
It was attended by an audience of       164.
Prints from This is How I Walk When I Have Given Up were selected       for The Northern Print         Biennale 2009 (4 July-4 October 2009; Laing Gallery, Hatton Gallery       and Northern Print; selectors:       artists Stephen Chambers and Kip Gresham, and Senior Curator, Prints,       V&amp;A, Gill Saunders;       visitors: 95,000).
One print was reproduced in the accompanying Northern         Biennale 2009 Print         Awards catalogue (ISBN: 0955584647, 9780955584640).
Fisher also       exhibited prints from the       series as one of a number of artists (including Peter Blake, Damien Hurst       and Barbara Rae) invited       to present work alongside work selected through open submission for Bite:         Artists Making Prints,       Mall Galleries, London (24 August &#8212; 6 September 2011; selectors: Chris       Orr, Richard Noyce,       Barton Hargreaves, Brad Faine, Paul Codwell; est.
visitors c.10,000).
Fisher's painting You Won't hear my Step was selected for the       Royal Academy Summer exhibition       in 2010 and featured in the RA Magazine (issue 107, Summer 2012, p50,       ISSN: 0956-9332),       where selector Stephen Chambers wrote of Fisher: "His work is a genuine       enquiry &#8212; exploring a       world that perhaps hasn't been seen elsewhere.
This is not a typical       picture, but it's the rawest.
He       has a singular love affair with landscape.
It's an overtly seductive       painting with a large decorative       element, which is part of the spell."
The Summer Exhibition attracts in       the region of 200,000 visitors       each year and 100,000 copies of the RA Magazine are published each issue.
The painting You Won't Hear my Step was featured in the       publication Royal Academy Illustrated         2010 (Royal Academy of Arts, London, ISBN: 978-1-0905711-56-7, p82)       published in an edition of       8,000.
(It was reproduced twice, pp11 and 82, and discussed by Richard       Cork in his introduction).
In 2012, it was exhibited as part of Meltwater (Eagle Gallery,       London, 5-28 April), which included       work by Nick Archer, Denise de Cordova, Tom Hammick and James Fisher and       attracted 975       visitors.
