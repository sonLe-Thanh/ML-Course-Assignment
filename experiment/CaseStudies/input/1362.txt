     Impact on Practitioners;       The 2009 article has influenced practitioner debate, particularly on the       issue of the utility of the       "informed observer" in cases of apprehended bias.
Holly Stout (11 King's       Bench Walk) cited the       article thus; `Indeed, one academic, having listed over some three         lengthy paragraphs all the         characteristics that judges have said should be imputed to the         fair-minded observer, has observed:         "If one were to attempt to describe the attributes of the Archangel         Michael, one could not do much         better"', and then proceeded to highlight the difficulties of this       construct, mirroring many of       Olowofoyeku's arguments.
Similarly, Philip Havers QC and Alasdair Henderson (1 Crown Office Row),       noted that it was       increasingly becoming apparent that the concept of the "fair-minded and       informed observer" is a       difficult one to apply in practice.
Referring to Olowofoyeku, they noted       that "Other commentators         have conducted a far more exhaustive analysis than is possible here of         the flaws in the concept",       and explicitly adopted Olowofoyeku's critique.
Thus Olowofoyeku's critique of the informed observer and identification       of the construct as one that       is seriously flawed have been accepted and adopted as the new received       wisdom on the issue of       bias by practitioners in the field of public law.
Impact on judicial reasoning and decision-making;       The "Bias and the Informed Observer" article (2009) was cited by       the High Court of Australia in       British American Tobacco Australia Services (2011).
French CJ       analysed the development of the       test for apprehended bias in the UK and Australia, and (at [36]) completed       that analysis with a       reference to Olowofoyeku's "critique of the fair-minded and informed       observer in Olowofoyeku       'Bias and the Informed Observer ...".
French CJ (at [48]) accepted Olowofoyeku's argument that interposition of       the fair-minded lay       person by the common law could never disguise the reality that it is the       assessment of the court       dealing with a claim of apparent bias that determines that claim.
In so       doing, French CJ took a       direct quotation from Olowofoyeku's 2009 article, viz., 'In the end,         despite the pitch on objectivity         and the view that the apprehensions of bias must have an objective         basis, it is the opinion of the         reviewing court on this issue that matters.'
Subsequently, French CJ referred to Olowofoyeku's "view that the         judicial construct of the informed         observer no longer provides a reliable guide to decision-making on the         issue of apparent bias".
His       response to this argument by Olowofoyeku was that "the utility of the         construct is that it reminds         the judges making such decisions of the need to view the circumstances         of claimed apparent bias,         as best they can, through the eyes of non-judicial observers.
In so         doing they will not have         recourse to all the information that a judge or practising lawyer would         have.
It requires the judges         to identify the information on which they are to make their         determinations."
French CJ conceded,       in line with Olowofoyeku's arguments, that "it is necessary to be         realistic about the limitations of the         test", but felt that the test "retains its utility as a guide to         decision-making in this difficult area".
Olowofoyeku's research has informed judicial decision-making at the       highest level, and has       brought to the minds of very senior judges (and, by extension, legal       practitioners, litigants, and law       students) the point that long-established common law principles are       susceptible to serious       contestations.
Issues of judicial bias and recusals are topical globally, and decisions       of the High Court of Australia       are influential throughout the common law world.
Recognition and       acceptance by the High Court of       Australia of Olowofoyeku's research in this area, first, as having helped       to shape the development       of recusal law, and, secondly, as having strongly challenged the main       construct (the impartial       observer) of common law legal systems in this area, extends the reach of       the impact to virtually the       entire English-speaking world.
In spite of French CJ's view that the       "impartial observer" test retains       its utility, Olowofoyeku's work has forced courts to confront this large       chink the armour of the       common law and to accept that the erstwhile received common law wisdom is       assailable.
It has       also helped to improve awareness and understanding of the hitherto hidden       tensions and       difficulties inherent in a construct that had long remained uncontested.
