     Kim's research on methods of theological engagement in the public sphere       has had significant and demonstrable impact in the following respects:     (a) In Search of Identity: Debates on religious Conversion in India       (OUP, 2005) was acknowledged as `a landmark in studies on conversion' (Seminar)       and `a handy reference both for policy-makers and scholars' (Telegraph)       by the media.
Since joining York St John University in 2005, Kim has given       invited public lectures and papers in various international meetings and       events (e.g.
Chennai &amp; Pune 2005; Cambridge 2006; Switzerland 2010       &amp; 2011).
As evidenced through email discussions with Kim and       invitations to speak at various church, religious and public events, this       book has been read by policy-makers, journalists, religious leaders and       the general public as well as researchers and students of sociology,       religion, theology, history, politics, and law.
In 2007 and 2008, Kim was       consulted by Indian religious and political leaders (including Mr Ashok       Chowgule, Director, Hindu Vivek Kendra; Mr Surendra Jain, National       Spokesman, Vishva Hindu Parishad).
Kim was invited to Lambeth Palace on 27th       July 2010 as a consultant to inform the Archbishop of Canterbury regarding       religious conversion in preparation for his visit to India during October       2010, and especially in preparation for a meeting with prominent Hindu       leaders in Bangalore.
The Archbishop and his assistants expressed their       great appreciation to Kim for his advice on religious conversion, which is       the most contentious issue between Christian and Hindu communities in       India.
(b)The main impact of the work on religion, peace and reconciliation has       been on the Christian communities and on the general public in South       Korea, particularly during the time of the International Conference on       Peace and Reconciliation in Seoul in 2010.
150 participants were invited       from 40 different countries, mainly prominent church leaders, peace       activists, NGO personnel, theologians and scholars of peace studies.
They       were joined by some 200 South Korean church leaders, politicians, policy       makers and NGO leaders.
Together the participants visited the       Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and the Joint Security Area (JSA) on the border       between the North and South Korea, which drew significant Korean media       attention.
Throughout the conference, national media broadcast and       published the activities of the conference and disseminated the conference       discussion through interviews with the participants.
A press conference       with the keynote speakers was held with 20 major national media       organisations which covered various issues concerning the theory and       practice of Christian contributions to peace and reconciliation in the       Korean peninsula and lessons from other contexts.
The amount of media       coverage given throughout the 5-day conference indicates that this event       was considered by wider Korean society as a major gathering for a serious       examination of peace in Korea.
As a result of the publication of the book Peace and Reconciliation,       Kim received an invitation from the University of York to provide a       half-day session on religion and peace-building for the Chevening Conflict       Resolution Course in 2010, sponsored by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth       Office (FCO).
It brought together twenty participants from across the       world who work in civil service, government, journalism, the military,       NGOs and United Nations posts.
(c)The Ebor Lectures represent a significant landmark in the engagement       of theology with public life in the UK.
Between October 2007 and October       2013, a total of 12,100 people attended the Ebor lectures (the average       attendance at every lecture was 400 and the lecture given by BBC business       correspondent Robert Peston reached 1,500).
As evidenced by the continuing       high attendance, the lectures have become a major event in the region,       generating discussions on contemporary issues and bridging between       academics, policy makers and religious experts and the wider public.
The       lectures are published in book form and through podcasts and blogs.
The       lectures are reported by the local and national media as they meet the       need for relevant interaction with various public issues (see, for       example, BBC News, 26 March 2009; The Telegraph, 26 March 2009, Daily         Mail, 26 March 2009; Church Times, 26 March 2009, 27       November 2009, 20 April 2010, 28 May 2010; The Press, 14 September       2006, 26 November 2009, 2 January 2010, 12 March 2010, 12 October 2009, 5       October 2010, 8 February 2011, 30 September 2011; Yorkshire Post,       16 February 2010; Mensa Magazine, December 2009, January 2010).
The impact of the Ebor Lectures is evidenced through some of those       attending who say that attending the lectures often gives them a better       understanding of issues; in some cases people say that this has made them       recognise the need to be more actively involved in issues (e.g.
poverty,       environmentalism, anti-racism) within their localities.
Some of the       Churches in York and the wider region are also using the content and       discussion emerging from the Ebor Lectures in promoting understanding       amongst their members about the important role of religion in the public       sphere.
