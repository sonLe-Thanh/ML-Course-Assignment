     Policy Input: During the course of the catchment research detailed above       we provided policy input through, for example, contributions by Bateman       to the UK Foresight Land Use Futures project (corroborating source       [7]) and advice through representing the RELU Programme's       interdisciplinary research on managing land and water use for sustainable       catchments to the Office of Science and Technology's review of River         Basin Management Plans (corroborating source [8]).
In addition, both       written and oral evidence was submitted to the House of Lords EU Select       Committee's inquiry into EU Freshwater Policy in 2011, in which an       adaptive and collaborative management cycle was recommended.
This evidence       was repeatedly cited in their Lordships' final reports to the UK       Government and the European Commission (corroborating source [9]).
The Tamar Catchment Management Plan: At a regional level,       the Catchment Management for the Protection of Water Resources       project's `template' and recommendations have informed the Tamar         Catchment Management Plan coordinated by the Westcountry Rivers       Trust (corroborating source [10]).
The Environment Manager for South West       Water, a major stakeholder in this catchment plan and who had the       opportunity to experience use of the social-participatory modelling tool ECM+,       is quoted in an ESRC review of the impact of RELU-funded research as       stating that:     "... with the [catchment] model on the screen, all the stakeholders         are able to work out         jointly-owned solutions to water quality .....We can all share in the         design of improvements,         rather than criticising each other.
This is completely new and not seen         before."
(corroborating source [11]).
Adoption of the Catchment Management Approach: The impact       of the RELU-funded research contributed to the announcement of a new       catchment management approach by Defra and the Environment Agency on World       Water Day, 22 March 2011.
At this launch event, Hiscock (UEA) and       Smith (SOAS) presented key findings from the RELU Catchment Management         for the Protection of Water Resources project and highlighted the       components of a template for catchment management and supporting tools for       catchment assessment, planning and knowledge exchange.
The Parliamentary       Under Secretary for Natural Environment, Water and Rural Affairs, Richard       Benyon, announced the adoption of the `catchment management approach' and       explained its role in meeting the goals of the EU Water Framework       Directive.
Following a project launched in 2011 involving 25 pilot       catchments, in May 2013 Defra published its policy framework Catchment         Based Approach: Improving the quality of our water environment       inviting partnerships to manage 100 catchments covering the whole of       England.
In response to these policy developments, water supply companies       have also embraced the catchment-based approach as demonstrated by an       industry-led conference organised by the Chartered Institution of Water       and Environmental Management (CIWEM) in November 2011, at which CIWEM       recognised:     "That major research studies by the University of East Anglia (RELU)         ... have shown over         and over again the basic, and common core principle for effective and         integrated catchment         management and partnership working" (corroborating source [12]).
The Fowey River Improvement Auction: As one of the first       NGOs to lead a catchment-based approach in engaging partners in solving       water quality problems, the Westcountry Rivers Trust, together with UEA       led by Day, piloted the Fowey Reverse Auction under South West       Water's Upstream Thinking project.
In this project, &#163;360k of the       water company's funds were distributed to farmers in the Fowey catchment       as a first national demonstration of Defra's Paying for Ecosystems         Services Action Plan (corroborating source [13]).
Demonstration Test Catchments: The Defra Demonstration Test       Catchments (DTCs) programme was set-up in 2009 to inform policy       initiatives about the catchment-based approach.
It aims to demonstrate new       partnership working in undertaking catchment research for managing land       and water to protect valuable ecosystem services and ensure the long-term       sustainability of agriculture.
Given previous experience of collaborative       working under the RELU programme, the contract for the Wensum DTC was       awarded to UEA and is led by Hiscock and Lovett       (corroborating evidence [14]).
The Wensum DTC actively promotes knowledge       exchange through its Wensum Alliance (www.wensumalliance.org.uk)       in sharing research results with catchment partnerships in East Anglia.
