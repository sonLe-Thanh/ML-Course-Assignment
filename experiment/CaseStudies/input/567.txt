     The main impacts of our research are on marine policy, regulation and       guidelines designed to bring environmental improvements and through       informing governments and industry on carbon capture and storage leaks as       well as threats of ocean acidification to food security.
The research has had international impact.
As a result of research into       ocean acidification and carbon capture, Hall-Spencer has contributed to       the drafting of the science basis of the next round of policy documents       for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Evidence 1).
Through EU       FP7 programmes (EPOCA, KnowSeas, MedSeA) he has provided presentations and       draft policy documents to staff responsible for informing governing bodies       on ocean acidification at the United Nations Environment Programme, EC DG       Research and Innovation, the European Science Foundation and the       International Union for the Conservation of Nature.
As highlighted by the       Senior Advisor of the International Union for Conservation of Nature "The         influence of the research carried out by the marine carbon group at         Plymouth University has ensured that ocean acidification, and the         potential of carbon sequestration leaks to cause harm to the marine         environment, are now being considered in depth alongside potential         solutions to the problem such as improved marine conservation and the         role of seagrasses as a Blue Carbon resource."
The research has been used as evidence in drawing up the US FORAM Act in       2008, has been incorporated into the US school curriculum, and has had       impact on knowledge and behaviours of practitioners/policy makers having       been incorporated into national and international strategies (e.g.
National Research Council of the National Academies 2010).
As stated by       the United States Department of Commerce "The influence of the research         carried out by the Marine Carbon Research Group at Plymouth University         is international.
In the USA there was explicit reference to the         Plymouth University ocean acidification work in the U.S. Senate when         hearing evidence for the federal Acidification Research and Monitoring         Act"     The research on natural analogs for CO2 exposure is being used       as evidence for the need to boost `Blue Carbon' IUCN initiatives and the       shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy (see Evidence 2-3).
The research contributed substantially to the UK setting up a &#163;12 million       Ocean Acidification research Programme (2010-2014).
The team a) assist the       UK government (via DEFRA and DECC) in their delivery of statutory       obligations under national legislative drivers (e.g.
UK Biodiversity       Action Plan, UK Marine and Coastal Access Bill), provide information to       aid the assessment process for the UK Regional Seas via the UKMMAS       Charting Progress III (in 2015) and the OSPAR Assessment Framework and       support the design and implementation of measures needed to achieve Good       Environmental Status in UK Regional Seas; (b) assist overseas governments       with similar environmental protection remits; (c) allow government-backed       international initiatives such as EPOCA, BIOACID, MedSeA, Mares &amp;       UKOOA to contextualise the work they are doing separately on Ocean       Acidification (see Evidence 4).
As stated by the Knowledge Exchange       Coordinator of the UK Ocean Acidification Research programme "The         team's work has made a major contribution to a number of key national         and international research initiatives to inform policy makers of the         future impact of OA on marine ecosystems and society".
More widely the research has had impacts on public discourse and raised       societal interest in the effects of ocean acidification.
Work by the       marine carbon research group has been covered extensively by newspapers       and on TV, the National Geographic Magazine, and in several science       documentaries that have been shown globally (see Evidence 4).
Thus the       marine carbon research has intrinsic interest, but is also designed to       predict the effects of ocean acidification and marine carbon capture and       storage driven by legislative and regulatory considerations.
