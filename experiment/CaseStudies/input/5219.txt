     The Unit has achieved impacts internationally from the breadth of its       bioenergy research through projects, demonstrations, advice and       consultancy, for governments, companies, communities and charity work.
The       routes to create impacts have increasingly been through the       European Bioenergy Research Institute (EBRI) formed in 2008.
A       commercially focused knowledge transfer team, formed within EBRI in 2011,       includes specialists from Aston Business School (Prof P Dey and RAs),       external partners and industrial collaborators.
EBRI is located in a       purpose designed and constructed, facility on campus, funded by Aston and       ERDF.
The self-sufficient building, completed at the end 2012,       incorporates research laboratories and facilities for demonstration and       pilot-scale trials by companies.
The expenditure of &#163;16M on construction       of the EBRI facility itself, had major business benefits for specialist       engineering design and construction companies and their employees, and the       building is designed to contribute significantly to the University's       Carbon Management Plans.
Impacts internationally on public policy and understanding, standards         and the environment     The following are examples, drawing on the breadth and depth of the       bioenergy research:     - "Sustainable biofuels: prospects and challenges": Bridgwater       was one of seven members of the Working Group that produced this       independent report for the Royal Society (2008).
Copies were sent to over       300 key contacts including leading figures in transport, academia, NGOs       and industry, as well as UK, EU and international policy makers.
Initial       print run was 1500 with electronic copies also available on the Royal       Society website.
The report led to extensive public debate in       mainstream international news, professional media, and other fora (over 80       high profile citations were recorded by the Royal Society in the first       week [5.A]).
- Bridgwater provided expert advice to the Carbon Trust; in 2008 this led       to the creation of the Pyrolysis Challenge [5.B] with &#163;20M funding       supported by UK Government, to transfer academic research into companies.
Antzela Fivga (PhD 2011) was subsequently employed by one of the Carbon       Trust Pyrolysis Challenge award companies, Future Blends Ltd, to use his       expertise directly for plastics pyrolysis.
- "Biomass Pyrolysis-A guide to UK Capabilities" (2011) International         Energy Agency (IEA), Bioenergy Task 34 (Pyrolysis).
Bridgwater led       the team that compiled this guide.
The Foreword by Prof David MacKay,       Chief Scientific Advisor at the Department of Energy and Climate         Change, stated "Guides such as this help to build that         awareness, and help guide research, innovation, and investment, as we         work out our pathway to a secure, low-carbon energy system" [5.C].
- Further recommendations by the IEA team, led to International         Standards for biofuels "Standard Specification for Pyrolysis Liquid       Biofuel" ASTM D7544-12, and "Standard Test Method for Pyrolysis Solids       Content in Pyrolysis Liquids by Filtration of Solids in Methanol" ASTM       D7579-09(2013).
Bridgwater contributed expertise on evaluating biofuels       composition and effectiveness.
- "Bioenergy Technology Innovation Needs Assessment (TINA)"       Bioenergy Report, (2012).
"Bridgwater played a key role as an academic         expert contributor and the TINA is now being used to develop programmes         across major public sector backed organisations that are supporting low         carbon innovation, through the Government Low Carbon           Innovation Coordination Group" [5.B].
- In recognition of the impact of their work, both Bridgwater and Hornung       have been appointed by Sustainability West Midlands as "Green Leaders";       positions through which they are invited to develop new solutions and       influence policy, act as leaders so share and pass on their experiences,       skills and knowledge to companies, organisations and the public.
- EBRI is used for promotion of bioenergy; including a visit by       The Princess Royal (2012), MPs, MEPs, international Government       representatives, the media, businesses and general public; there have been       41 press releases since its launch (2008-July2013) and 69 other media       (international press &#8212; BBC, ITV, Sangat TV) and public briefings between       January 2012 and July 2013.
Economic impacts and associated societal benefits, worldwide     From the start of the ERDF project in 2011 (to July 2013), more than 100       companies have benefitted from presentations and individual 2-day       "assistance" sessions drawing from distinct aspects of the research [5.D].
Companies include manufacturers with wastes and residues, waste       contractors, land and estate developers, and pyrolysis equipment       manufacturers.
Of these, 85 partners (two thirds being SMEs) benefit by       working actively with EBRI to develop their businesses; 9 companies have       committed (by July 2013) to specific feasibility projects, including some       of those named in section 2.
The following are specific examples of how       the assistance provided is influencing business developments:     - Brookside CIC secured funding (&#163;15k) and support from UnLtd to follow       up a feasibility study by EBRI that identified the viability of developing       a `community-scale' bioenergy plant, based on Aston research, to provide       heat, power and cooling to a local Community Centre (July 2013).
- EBRI worked with Environmental Infrastructure Development Company Ltd       (EIDC) to form a spin-out company from Aston, Optimus Energy Ltd,       (February 2013) and will go to the markets for funding in early 2014.
Optimus has formed relationships with Dytecna Ltd and Pearwalk Ltd       (specialist equipment designers and manufacturers) under NDA's entered       into in June and March 2013 respectively.
Both companies have committed         their own capital to build "pre-commercial" stage Pyroformers.
New       employment has already been created for staff, with more envisaged.
The       impact on Dytecna and Pearwalk, not previously in bioenergy, following       introductions through the ERDF project, having seen the benefits of diversifying         into the environmental sector.
"Working with EBRI has identified         the potential for entry into the bioenergy sector with a new range of         products and the diversification into a new technology area.
This will         help with the protection of jobs and possibility of new job creation.
Without support from EBRI we would have been unable to consider         diversification into this aspect of green technology" (Dytecna Business         Development Manager [5.D]).
Since 2009, Coca-Cola has benefitted from Bridgwater's advice, as one of       three members of their international Technical Advisory Board [5.F], on       producing from biomass their fully sustainable "PlantBottleTM".
This role arose from publicity following him receiving the Don Klass       award.
Through the InterReg "Delivering local bioenergy to NW Europe"       project, five "Regional support centres" were established (2011), in       France, Germany, Netherlands, UK and Belgium, providing information to       companies, investors and regional authorities.
Technoeconomic evaluations       (based on [3.5, 3.6]) have been provided, for example to the St. Francis       Group, who are (July 2013) preparing regeneration plans for       Tyseley Environmental Enterprise District, Birmingham.
The advice has been       used to identify locations for bioenergy plant, feedstock supplies and       local power users [5.G].
As part of Birmingham's environmental planning to achieve CO2       reduction of 60% by 2026, a member of EBRI staff has been 50% funded by       Birmingham City Council (UK's most populous city after London) since       February 2013.
Technoeconomic assessments have identified technical       approaches, sites and resources for waste disposal via pyrolysis,       simultaneous with power generation.
The information was provided in spring       2013 to support preparation of the City's tender documents for waste       disposal for the 25 year period from 2019 [5.H].
In July 2013 West       Midlands companies were invited to supply wastes and residues to EBRI, so       diverting materials from going directly to landfill or incineration.
A small technical services company, C.A.R.E.Ltd, Belfast, has drawn       knowledge since 2008 for customers worldwide [5.I], from Aston's bioenergy       research.
The company was formed by Peacocke (Aston PhD 1994, part-time RA       until 2008) and Bridgwater was on the company board from its formation       until 2011.
By July 2013, C.A.R.E.
had expanded including by recruiting       former bioenergy PhD students for their knowledge of catalysis,       biorefinery supply chains and equipment design, so continuing impact from       the Aston research through the company.
EBRI has impacted a Charity to support rural Indian         communities, with consequential social and environmental       benefits, and business opportunities for Industrial Boilers Ltd,       Delhi.
Working with the Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, through an       RCUK Science Bridge project and more than &#163;500k phased funding from       Oglesby Charitable Trust [5.J], a transportable Pyroformer in a standard       ISO container, was first operated in the Punjab in June 2013.
In the first       month to July 2013, this generated oil, gas and biochar from waste biomass       from the village so reducing pollution from traditional straw burning in       open fields.
Fuel-oils produced were used to drive water pumps and       generate power, the char used as fertiliser.
Power supplied to local       communities included to a school never previously lit.
