     Improving Public Understanding of Social Issues     In order to increase awareness of the research findings and the       consequences of inequality and to       campaign for change, in 2009 Pickett and Wilkinson established The         Equality Trust (TET).
This       is a not-for-profit educational and campaigning organisation       (www.equalitytrust.org.uk) with core       funding from the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust.
Through this they       created the One Society       campaign to work with policy-makers, employers, other decision-makers and       influencers who have       significant power to affect rates of income inequality       (www.onesociety.org.uk).
TET produces       research digests and updates that are widely cited in the media and has 23       UK local groups and       28 international groups, including 8 in the USA.
The Trust also has 8000+       followers on Twitter and       7000+ on Facebook.
Pickett and Wilkinson, through TET, have directly       contributed to public       understanding and debate through more than 600, predominantly       non-academic, conferences       keynotes and seminars, including national, foreign and international       government ministries and       agencies, the UK Cabinet Office, health authorities, political party       conferences, universities, trade       unions, faith groups, NGOs, think tanks and charities (e.g., the United       Nations, Canadian       parliament, US Congress, and the OECD &#8212; in the UK, USA, Australia, New       Zealand, Bhutan,       Czech Republic, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Turkey,       Italy, Denmark,       Belgium, Iceland, Canada, Germany, Singapore, Switzerland, Brazil and       Malta).
They have also       been invited to disseminate their research in magazines, newspapers, and       popular journals.1     Shaping and Informing Political Debate     In the lead up to the last General Election, TET asked parliamentary       candidates to sign the       Equality Pledge, which described Pickett and Wilkinson's research, and       asked them to "actively       support the case for policies designed to narrow the gap between rich and       poor" &#8212; it was signed by       75 MPs who entered the new parliament, including 11 Conservatives, 18       Liberal Democrats       (including 2 cabinet ministers), 1 Green and 45 Labour MPs.
Pickett &amp;       Wilkinson were consulted       by the Liberal Democrat's Policy Consultation on Inequality and by the       Green Party Strategy group,       each of which was developing manifesto commitments to greater equality and       fairness.
Prime       Minister David Cameron In his Hugo Young lecture, prior to the election,       said "Research by         Richard Wilkinson and Katie Pickett has shown that among the richest         countries, it's the more         unequal ones that do worse according to almost every quality of life         indicator".2 Ed Milliband wrote       about the importance of academic research for changing politics in The New       Statesman, saying       "The Spirit Level by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett is a book in         the best of that tradition.
"3       Following the election, BBC 4 journalist Mukul Devichand said "Both         Prime Minister David         Cameron and Labour leader Ed Milliband appear to be disciples of The         Spirit Level.
"4     Contributing to Campaigns for Change     Local Equality Trust groups are active in campaigning, using the research       base as evidence.
For       example, the London branch, My Fair London, developed a pledge for       candidates in the London       Mayoral election, stating "we draw heavily on The Spirit Level".5       Equality Bristol produced an       `Equality Declaration' for local election candidates to sign.
The Newport       group successfully       campaigned for the setting up of a local Fairness Commission.
The Spirit Level has been extensively reviewed, discussed, and referred       to by commentators,       politicians and others in the international printed media (from the       Financial Times and The       Economist to The New York Times; quotes are available at:       www.equalitytrust.org.uk/node/200),       on radio, television (including the BBC and CNN), the internet, and in       legislative assemblies       including both Houses of Parliament in England, the Scottish Parliament,       the Welsh Assembly, the       New Zealand, Australian and Canadian parliaments.6     Inspiring the Production of Cultural Artefacts     A Spirit Level Documentary is in production by award-winning independent       documentary maker       Christopher Hird of Dartmouth Films and directed by Kathryn Round.
The       film raised $70,000 in 40       days through crowd sourcing and has received grants from the Tudor Trust       and the City of Sydney.
The ESRC funded Pickett, through its Follow-On Fund, to produce The Young       Persons Guide to       Inequality, educational materials for 16-19 year olds, based on The         Spirit Level.
These include: a       Theatre in Education Learning Module, Kuan's Wonderland (a novel with       study guide), a statistics       learning module, Economicum, a game for learning about economics and       inequality, collections of       videos and other art based on The Spirit Level.

Influencing policy     There is growing international recognition of The Spirit Level       research: head of the International       Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, said "Now all of us have a better         understanding that a more         equal distribution of income allows for more economic stability, more         sustained economic growth,         and healthier societies with stronger bonds of cohesion and trust.
"7       United Nations Secretary       General, Ban Ki-Moon, quoting from The Spirit Level said "Social         and economic inequalities can         tear the social fabric, undermine social cohesion and prevent nations         from thriving.
Inequality can         breed crime, disease and environmental degradation and hamper economic         growth.
"8 Nobel Prize       winning economist, Paul Krugman, wrote, "Wilkinson-type views about the         corrosive effects of         inequality are going seriously mainstream.
"9 Wilkinson       was a keynote speaker at the High Level       Meeting on Wellbeing and Happiness at the UN in New York in April 2011,       which resulted in UN       resolution 65/309 Happiness: towards a holistic approach to development,       which recognised that       "gross domestic product...does not adequately reflect the...wellbeing         of people in a country"     In terms of UK policy impact, The Spirit Level has perhaps been most       influential in the       establishment and outcomes of local Fairness Commissions.10       Since 2010, twelve Local       Authorities, (Birmingham, Blackpool, Islington, Leicester, Liverpool,       Newcastle, Newport,       Portsmouth, Sheffield, Southampton, Tower Hamlets, York) have established       `Fairness       Commissions', to investigate and implement ways of reducing inequality in       their areas such as       recommending and campaigning for, the payment of a Living Wage.
Wilkinson was a       Commissioner for Islington and York, and Pickett for York.
All Fairness       Commissions cite The       Spirit Level as inspiration for their formation and objectives and all       that have reported so far       support the implementation of a Living Wage and pay ratios.
Pickett was       appointed in July 2013 to       the independent Living Wage Commission.
The Spirit Level also       influenced the High Pay       Commission,11 and the UK Drug Policy Commission.12     The Equality Act which received Royal Assent in 2010 included a duty that       local and national public       bodies must `have regard to the desirability of reducing socio-economic       inequalities' in their       decision-making.
The Spirit Level was cited in the Lords debate.13       Introducing the Equality Bill, the       then Labour Government's Equalities Office quoted The Spirit Level       in support of the socio-economic       duty.14     In addition, The Spirit Level has been cited in numerous policy       documents, including: Fair Society,       Healthy Lives: The Marmot Review http://www.ghwatch.org/;       Global Health Watch 3       http://www.ghwatch.org; Action         for Children, Backing the Future: Why Investing in Children if       Good for Us All http://www.ncw.gc.ca/l.3bd.2t.1ils%40-eng.jsp?lid=433;       WHO Europe, Mental Health and Resilience in Europe www.mentalhealth.org.uk/publications/mh-         resilience-inequalities/; WHO Europe, Addressing the Social       Determinants of Health: the Urban       Dimension and the Role of Local Government.
