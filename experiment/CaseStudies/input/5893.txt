     Khan's impact on the field of development is demonstrated most clearly by       his presence in an advisory capacity in organisations such as the UN, the       World Bank and AFD.
Since 2010, for example, Khan has been a member of the       Committee of Experts on Public Administration at the UN, a geographically       diverse, select group of 24 specialists that supports the Economic and       Social Council in promoting and developing public administration and       governance in Member States.
The Committee meets annually in New York.
Khan, a representative of Bangladesh, has made numerous recommendations       that are referred to in reports of the committee (1 and 2, below).
Khan's expertise has also been solicited by DFID in various research,       educational and training capacities since 2008, including research and       briefings on South Asia, anti-corruption, growth and governance.
Between       2007 and 2010, Khan was Research Leader on DFID's `Governance for Growth'       project that investigated how certain countries, largely in Asia, have       transformed their economies to achieve sustained economic growth without       fulfilling `good governance' requirements (3, 4).
This work, and       particularly the analysis of political settlements, has influenced a       number of other major DFID-funded projects on governance.
Khan's influence       on DFID is confirmed by Max Everest-Phillips (5), formerly responsible for       DFID's Development Advice and Policy and currently Director of the UNDP       Global Centre for Public Service Excellence, who contends that Khan's work       has also impacted upon the World Bank's approach:     "Khan is the most influential person in the UK working on governance         and development.
He challenges orthodoxy in a very effective way.
His         ideas fed into DFID policy, but he also pushed the World Bank to be less         prescriptive and more open to different ideas, models."
Khan's impact on the World Bank is corroborated by his invitations to       participate in numerous World Bank meetings and missions.
He is a member       of the World Bank's Panel of Experts on Policy Implementation, (informally       called the Brains Trust) since 2012.
This panel, comprised of four eminent       academics working on governance and institutions, advises the World Bank's       Finance and Private Sector Development team on achievable institutional       and governance reforms for industrial policy.
Thus far, it has assisted       the Planning Commission of India with their Manufacturing Plan.
In a       letter from Ivan Rossignol of the World Bank (6), it was stated that       Khan's invitation to the Panel was based on his position as `a leading       thinker on questions of institutions, governance, how to achieve growth in       practice and on what makes for effective real-world policy.'
As a result of Khan's work on governance and the 'political settlement'       in Bangladesh (output d), he was involved in the World Bank's 2010 mission       to Bangladesh on power sector reforms.
Khan's work on political       settlements fed into the policy advice provided to the Bangladesh       government.
A large part of Khan's work outside academe has been conducted in close       collaboration with the French AFD.
He has participated in the       AFD-sponsored `African Programme on Re-thinking Development Economies'       (APORDE) since 2007, a South African Department of Trade and Industry       initiative, comprising a two-week seminar series involving policy makers       and civil society representatives from Africa, Asia and Latin America,       exploring alternatives to mainstream approaches to development issues so       as to promote original, dynamic thinking.
He has also contributed substantially to a long-standing AFD project that       examines institutions, governance and growth in developing countries,       including India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
Khan's work has greatly       influenced AFD policy and the policy advice it provides developing       countries, as confirmed by Nicolas Meisel, Senior Programme Manager in the       AFD's Research Department:     "I have observed that, in the aid industry, Khan's work has been         increasingly cited over the past 5 years.
He has added a lot to the         field, especially through his papers for DFID on governance capabilities         for managing industrial transformation in developing countries.
Khan has         a strong, long-term relationship with AFD.
The domain of ideas put         forward in his work on governance and political settlements has         influenced the planning of new instruments, policies and programmes at         AFD" (7, 8).
Together with Meisel, Khan has also offered policy advice directly to       governments in developing countries.
For instance, in 2013, he presented       at a four-hour roundtable with senior members of the Ethiopian government       including the Prime Minister, following which AFD received an official       request to further advise the country.
Further evidence of Khan's impact is demonstrated by the many references       to his research in reports published by leading development institutions,       for example the US Government Accountability Office, Developmental       Leadership Programme (Australia) (10), the Overseas Development Institute       (9), Asia Foundation, Netherlands Institute for International Relations,       Advisory Board for Irish Aid, Christian Aid (11) and Action Aid.
