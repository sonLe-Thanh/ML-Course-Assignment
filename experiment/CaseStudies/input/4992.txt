     Marked rise in vaginal delivery by HIV positive women: The       improvement in vaginal delivery       rates for HIV-infected women is the greatest impact resulting from this       research on antiretroviral       treatments in pregnancy.
The percentage of HIV-infected women in the UK       and Ireland delivering       vaginally rose from 14% in 2000-2006 to 31% in 2007-2011 (Section 2).
This       improvement in       vaginal delivery rates for HIV-infected women is due to the better       understanding of the use of       antiretroviral drugs in pregnancy in which KCL research played a major       role (Section 2).
In the       period 2007-2011, women commenced antiretroviral therapy earlier in       pregnancy compared to       2000-2006.
Antiretroviral therapy started at 23 rather than 26 weeks.
Further fall in mother-to-child transmission rates: The overall       HIV mother-to-child       transmission rate for the UK and Ireland fell from 1.2% in 2000-2006 to       0.5% in 2007-2011       (Section 2).
Findings used in national guidelines for management of HIV infection         in pregnant women:       The KCL research covered in section 2 has had a considerable impact on       changing approaches to       managing HIV infection in pregnant women.
Based on KCL research, the 2008       British HIV       Association (BHIVA) guidelines [9] recommended that HIV-infected pregnant       women should be       treated with short-term antiretroviral therapy if their viral load was       above 10,000 copies/ml.
Standard antiretroviral treatment should begin in the second trimester       with the aim of reducing the       viral load to less than 50 copies/ml before delivery.
Women with less than       50 copies/ml at full term       could deliver vaginally.
BHIVA guidelines recommended that women who require treatment for HIV for       their own health       should be treated with an antiretroviral regimen regardless of viral load.
Based on KCL research,       the BHIVA guidelines also allow zidovudine monotherapy as an option for       pregnant women with       certain immunological and virological issues.
Based on further KCL       research, the 2012 BHIVA       guidelines [10] advanced the date for starting HAART in pregnancy (Section       2).
The BHIVA guidelines are widely distributed &#8212; HIV Medicine distributed       print copies of the 2008       and 2012 BHIVA guidelines to all subscribers &#8212; and are also widely       accessed online.
As of 11       March 2013, the 2008 guidelines had been accessed 18,157 times (16,242       individuals) and the       2012 guidelines 9,051 times (8,258 individuals).
Findings used in international and national treatment publications:       This KCL research has       had a very significant impact on international and national guidelines for       treating HIV-infected       pregnant women and preventing MTCT.
Dr de Ruiter was the chair and lead author of the British HIV Association       (BHIVA) 2008 pregnancy       guidelines [9] which allowed vaginal delivery as an option for HIV       positive women, whereas       previously PLCS was recommended for all.
The National Health Service       accredited the guidelines       in July 2012.
KCL research findings on doses of lopinavir in treatment of       HIV in pregnant women       (Section 2) were incorporated in the 2008 and 2012 BHIVA guidelines       [9,10].
Dr de Ruiter was the       chair of the British HIV Association (BHIVA) and Children's HIV       Association (CHIVA) position       statement on infant feeding in the UK 2011 [11,12].
KCL findings have had considerable impact on other national and       international guidelines.
These       include 2010 WHO recommendations for a public health approach to       antiretroviral drugs for       treating pregnant women and preventing HIV infection in infants [13].
The       revision of the clinical       protocol for the WHO European region 2012 used the findings of KCL       research to recommend       zidovudine monotherapy as an option for preventing HIV transmission from       HIV-infected mothers       to their infants [14].
The findings also have a considerable impact on the       Royal College of       Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guide on management of HIV in pregnancy       [15], the Swedish       guidelines on treatment of HIV in pregnancy [16] and USA Department of       Health and Human       Services (DHHS) recommendations [17].
Findings used in further work on guidelines: KCL research       underpinned an investigation on       differences and similarities between the US DHHS perinatal guidelines and       the BHIVA 2012       pregnancy guidelines [18].
Public-facing communication: Patient information leaflets produced       by NAM (National AIDS       Manual) [19] refer to KCL research on MTCT rates and HAART.
The HIV       treatment information       base (i-base.info) also uses the findings of KCL research [20].
