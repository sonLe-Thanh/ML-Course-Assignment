     Approximately 500,000 people are currently affected by Alzheimer's       Disease in the UK.
An estimated 62,000 people develop the disease each       year, of which the majority are in the early stages of the disease.
Prior       to the date of onset of the impact (March 2011), the three anti-       cholinesterase drugs, Aricept (donepezil), Reminyl (galantamine) and       Exelon (rivastigmine), although clinically approved much earlier, were not       available on the NHS for early stage Alzheimer's.
The decision as to       whether any treatment is available on the NHS is made by the National       Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE).
NICE considered that the       drugs offered insufficient patient benefit to justify their cost and       sought additional longer-term clinical data and a rationale for their       action [9].
The mechanism of action for the drug galantamine was elucidated by the       research carried out at Lancaster.
NICE eventually reversed their earlier       decision in Mar 2011 [10] taking into account the additional clinical       data, the mechanistic rationale for use of galantamine in early       Alzheimer's (Lancaster research), and in response to pressure from various       patient and carer groups, clinicians, and most notably from Alzheimer's       Society [11-13].
There was an additional argument for the reversal of the       initial decision, namely that the initial economic model used by NICE to       calculate whether the drugs offered "value for money", did not accurately       reflect the hidden economic costs of care outside of hospital.
The       Alzheimer's Society used Lancaster's research as a part of its campaign,       generalising the findings to the entire class of anti-cholinesterase drugs       (galantamine, donepezil, and rivastigmine).
The clinical studies revealed       that patients with "mild" i.e.
early stage Alzheimer's did indeed benefit       from these drugs.
Lancaster's basic research (in which NMR spectroscopy       played a crucial role) provided the mechanistic evidence for the disease-       modifying effects of the drug galantamine, thus rationalising the clinical       results.
The policy change by NICE has led to direct impact, enhancing the quality       of life for 100,000s of Alzheimer's patients (over 300,000 galantamine       prescriptions alone were dispensed in the UK in 2012 [8]).
This in turn       would have had a substantial, indirect impact on the lives of spouses,       immediate family, and those involved in caring for the sufferers.
The       impact continues as new patients come into the pool.
The impact is certainly beyond the UK, though this cannot be       corroborated.
The UK medicines regulatory bodies, which include the       Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and NICE, are       seen as important standards across the world.
The confidence expressed by       NICE in the use of galantamine and related drugs in early stage       Alzheimer's would have enhanced the use of these drugs in other parts of       the world.
The interdisciplinary chemistry-biomedical Lancaster research into the       disease-modifying effects of galantamine was directly funded by the       Alzheimer's Society over the period 2006-2009.
The Society promptly       recognised the significance of the results that suggested that treatment       should be initiated at the earliest stages of development of Alzheimer's       disease.
The research and its implications were widely publicised through       their printed literature and their website [14-16].
The following quotation from Alzheimer's Society Newsletter `The Journal       of Quality Research in Dementia' [14] refers directly to the Lancaster       research:     "There is an exciting piece of research from David Allsop's group in         Lancaster, looking at the potential therapeutic properties of existing         acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
These drugs are used currently for         treating symptoms of dementia, but there is lack of substantial evidence         to show whether or not they may be of therapeutic value in treating         disease progression.
The results of this current study will highlight         important evidence in putting forward an argument in using these drugs         in a therapeutic context."
The impact case study is supported by a letter [17] from the former       Director of Research (2003- 2011) of Alzheimer's Society from which the       following passage is reproduced:     "The Amyloid &#946; aggregation starts in the brain many years before         symptoms of dementia appear in Alzheimer's disease and the search is         still on for drugs that can prevent the aggregation early.
Prof Allsop's         research demonstrating that Galantamine had an additional biochemical         activity of inhibiting this aggregation was an important supporting         argument at the time of the campaign.
It seemed to promise that the drug         would likely be efficacious in the early stages of disease.
Although not         evidenced at the time, this result made it more likely that some of the         other cholinesterase inhibitors might also have biochemical effects in         addition to the inhibition of acetylcholine degradation....Together with         the critical reviews of existing clinical research it helped win the         case for people with dementia and their carers."
