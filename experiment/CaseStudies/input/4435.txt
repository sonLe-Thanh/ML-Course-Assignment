     The UK government Department for Communities and Local Government have       stated that "local councils play a vital role in making sure the UK is         prepared for the impacts of climate change at a local level.
They         provide many services that will be affected by climate change.
This will         present different challenges to each area, and local councils are free         to decide how best to address these challenges and take advantage of any         opportunities."
[source 1]     Birmingham City Council, the largest local authority in the UK, have       worked in partnership with UoB researchers in the BUCCANEER project and       drawn extensively on their research to inform the City's approach to       adapting to the increasing risk of extreme temperatures posed by the       combination of urban heat and climate change.
The adoption of the       BUCCANEER tool is clearly demonstrated in the City's Climate Change       Adaptation Action Plan, in its planning framework and in its emerging       approach to identifying the effect of extreme temperatures on its most       vulnerable residents (such as the elderly and people in poor health).
The       work has achieved impact on public policy through helping the City       underpin its strategic direction on this crucial issue and providing a       novel operational tool for use in spatial planning; there are further       health benefits from its adoption by public health analysts in the City.
The partnership work between the Council and the research team continuing       with the HiTemp project which is viewed by the Council, along with the       ongoing NERC CASE studentship, as the means for informing the next stages       of their work on climate change adaptation.
BUCCANEER &#8212; a university / city council partnership       This partnership between the City Council and UoB was fostered through       Birmingham's Climate Change Adaptation Partnership which was established       in 2008.
The Partnership planned to understand the risks to people and       places from the UHI and climate change but a lack of research meant that       only a blanket approach to understanding heat distribution across       Birmingham could be used.
In order to understand the local risks, a new       tool was required [sources 2 and 3].
UoB research delivered a tool that       now enables the City Council to conduct spatial risk assessments.
The       BUCCANEER project established a new web-based planning tool based on the       modelled UHI maps, and was first made available to the Council in 2011.
The tool is available at http://www.birminghamclimate.com/       for free public use by arrangement with the UoB team.
The tool enables mapping of Birmingham's UHI up to 2100, together with       transport, health, air quality, housing, population and life expectancy,       in order to help identify vulnerability and risks for people and places.
It also contains a green infrastructure assessment function and the       ability to export layers into Google Earth for 3D mapping as a       communications tool.
The BUCCANEER tool has been demonstrated to a wide       range of council services and external organisations, including the       Environment Agency, the NHS, Public Health England and Natural England,       and has been widely welcomed.
The partnership work on this issue has won two major awards: (a) the       Local Authority Research and Intelligence Association (LARIA) award in       2010 for ground-breaking GIS risk mapping research, and (b) the Lord       Stafford Award for Innovation for Environmental Sustainability in 2012.
BUCCANEER's contribution to Birmingham's Green Vision for an adapted         city The overarching approach to mitigating and responding to       climate change in Birmingham has formed a crucial aspect of the work its       Green Commission [source 4] and its subsequent Green Living Spaces Plan       (publication consultation draft issues December 2012; adopted by City       Council September 2013) [source 5].
The novelty of the city's green vision       is stated explicitly: "No other UK city has undertaken such a         comprehensive combined evaluation and mapping exercise.
This has         produced a totally new map series of the city ...[which are the] new         evidence bases that the city must work with, in the near future with all         its stakeholders, public, private and citizens to collectively address         these leading green city challenges."
Councillor James MacKay, in       [source 5]     The Green Living Spaces Plan links the issues of climate change, public       health and spatial planning as a key ingredient of the city's future       planning framework, and informs other detailed policies.
Principle 1 in       the plan is "an adapted city"; the case study used in the Plan for       this principle is BUCCANEER.
The Plan says the use of BUCCANEER means that       "for the first time decisions can be taken with consideration of the         varying heat stress across the City caused by the urban heat island and         the likely impacts of climate change up to 2100...
Thanks to BUCCANEER         and the follow-on studies Birmingham has become recognised by the EU as         a Peer City; and the city is building an international reputation for         its climate modelling" (source 5 p.13).
City Council planning policy and guidance       The use of the BUCCANEER tool was identified in the City Council's public       consultation on its Core Strategy for sustainable growth [source 6], where       its proposal on adapting to climate change said that their Development       Management process would be used to ensure that all new developments       requiring permission would include measures to reduce the impact of       extreme heat.
The document highlights the role of BUCCANEER as the       principal means to implement this approach; the tool enables the       identification of areas most vulnerable to extreme heat and demonstrates       the impact of adaptation measures, as well as having the potential to       inform future planning decisions (source 6 paras 5.38-5.40).
Subsequently, the Council issued its public consultation version of its       Detailed Supplementary Planning Policy Guidance [source 7]; this is the       guidance which all developers need to consider when submitting planning       applications anywhere in the city.
Section 3 of this guidance focuses on       Green Infrastructure and Climate Change Adaptation, and sets out the       requirements on developers to show, with evidence, that they have taken       account of the Council's policy on climate change adaptation.
It states: "Birmingham's         approach has been to use Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping         (BUCCANEER Project) to understand the varying degree of climate change         impact across the city on two key areas:            Temperature and UHI       Flood risk                        Developers need to take into account this mapping to assess how         extreme weather and climate impacts will vary depending on their site         location."
The Council expects all new developments in the city to minimise       overheating and reduce the reliance on air conditioning.
Site layout and       building design can help to reduce the UHI effect making developments more       resilient to increased temperatures as a result of climate change.
This       Guidance was formally adopted by the City Council in September 2013.
[source 8]     BUCCANEER and planning for public health       As well as the spatial planning measures, Birmingham's Climate Change       Adaptation Partnership has also been concerned with the public health       implications of higher temperatures in the city.
BUCCANEER is being used       as one of the tools to identify which communities are likely to need the       most help to adapt to the effects of climate change.
In cities like       Birmingham, much of the most-deprived population lives in       densely-populated areas subject to UHI effects, with consequent       implications for public health planning.
The development of the tool       helped demonstrate the significance of this issue to senior public health       officials in the City (Public Health Lead | Policy &amp; Regulation).
The       practical value of data on temperature extremes is now being considered       when analysing issues like the pattern of hospital admissions for lung       conditions and asthma and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) in       Birmingham.
As well as assessing the clinical aspects, they are also       looking to include the wider determinants and risk factors such as air       quality/pollution and climate/temperature as provided by the BUCCANEER       tool.
Wider use of BUCCANEER       There is also evidence that other organisations are using the BUCCANEER       tool.
For instance, the major energy company E.ON have confirmed that they       used the BUCCANEER tool when assessing the potential for investing in a       combined heat and power solution for the new New Street Station, and said       that "the tool clarified the primary long term need for cooling as         opposed to heat and helped us better understand future demand profiles".
[source 9]     Birmingham Airport's Climate Change Adaptation Report (May 2011) says       that the Airport Company have agreed to share information with the City       Council to use BUCCANEER, and notes the potential advantage of having a       far greater resolution (500m) than the 25km of the national tool, known as       UKCP09 [source 10, p.14].
