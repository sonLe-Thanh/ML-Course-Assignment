     Janssen's HIV drug etravirine is a poorly soluble drug requiring       specialised formulation.
Davies and Roberts provided critical       characterisation of the structure and stability of various etravirine       formulations, supporting the regulatory approval of the resulting       spray-dried solid dispersion tablet, the first formulation of its type to       reach the market.
Etravirine, marketed by Janssen as Intelence&#174;,       was the first Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI) to be       licensed in over 10 years and the first to show activity in people who had       developed resistance to other HIV drugs.
Subsequent updating of       formulation development strategies at Janssen has led to a further       spray-dried solid dispersion tablet formulation reaching the market, the       Hepatitis C treatment telaprevir.
Janssen confirmed that the spray dried manufacturing route required "significant         optimisation and understanding to satisfy both our internal processes         and external regulatory approval" and that School of Pharmacy       research (6) provided "critical structural and stability information on         various formulation variants of etravirine" providing the regulatory       bodies with "evidence that we mechanistically understood the product"       (a).
FDA approval of Intelence&#174; was achieved in January 2008,       with the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls review stating that "Review         of the drug product information resulted in several comments for the         applicant.
These primarily related to the spray-dried powder and tablet         manufacturing processes.
The applicant's responses to the comments have         been found to be adequate".
(b) EU approval was achieved later that       same year.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) stated that "spray         drying was selected as the preferred manufacturing technique of         etravirine solid dispersions.
In addition, formulation studies have been         performed to identify an adequate stabilizer for the active substance in         solid dispersions."
and "The active substance is well         characterised and documented.
It is a poorly soluble substance that has         been formulated as a solid dispersion before tableting in order to         overcome the solubility issues and to improve the bioavailability".
(c)     Global Phase III clinical trials in treatment experienced patients with       evidence of NNRTI resistance (named DUET 1 and 2) confirmed that those       treated with Intelence&#174; had significantly better virological       suppression at 24 weeks than those receiving placebo (d): 56 v. 39% in       DUET 1 (patient numbers, n=612) and 62% vs. 44% in DUET 2 (n=591).
An       optional extension to the trial confirmed consistently higher sustained       response rates with Intelence&#174; at both 48 and 96 weeks (d).
Prof Richard Haubrich of the University of California San Diego, an       Investigator on the DEUT studies, said "Etravirine breaks new ground in         the NNRTI class, and provides a new option to thousands of         treatment-experienced patients with NNRTI-resistant HIV".
(e)       Following initial regulatory approval of 100mg tablets in 2008 and 200mg       tablets in 2010, 25mg tablets were approved in 2012 coinciding with       approval for use in children from 6 years (US (b) and EU (c)).
Intelence&#174;       is only approved for treatment-experienced patients who have HIV strains       that are resistant to an NNRTI and other HIV drugs.
It is not approved for       treatment na&#239;ve patients as further evidence is required to determine the       benefits to this patient population.
Global Intelence&#174; sales       were $349M in 2012 and sales for the first half of 2013 were $192M, up 12%       from the first half of 2012 ($171M) (f).
In 2011 around 34 million people were living with HIV, however, the       number dying of AIDS-related causes fell to 1.7 million, down 24% since       2005 (UNAIDS Global Fact Sheet, 2012).
This is partly related to improved       antiretroviral therapy.
Such therapy is, however, being challenged by the       emergence of viral resistance.
Figures from the WHO show that in       high-income countries (US, EU, Japan, Australia) 10-17% of treatment-na&#239;ve       patients have resistance to at least one HIV drug, while estimates of HIV       drug resistance in resource limited countries is around 6.6%, with       resistance to NNRTIs the most common (WHO HIV Drug Resistance Report,       2012).
In 2009, the combination of Intelence&#174; with two other drugs       having activity against resistant HIV (raltegravir and darunavir) was       trialled in heavily treatment experienced patients (n=103) with       multidrug-resistant HIV.
Results showed that 90% of patients had       undetectable viral loads after 24 weeks and 86% after 48 weeks, similar to       that expected in treatment na&#239;ve patients (g).
This combination of drugs       was subsequently endorsed as candidates for 3rd line therapy by       the WHO in 2010, and in 2012 etravirine was further endorsed by the WHO,       by being placed on their List of Prequalified Medicinal Products, which is       used to guide UN agencies procurement (h).
Intelence&#174; is one of three HIV drugs available via Janssen's       Global Access Partnership Program (GAPP) through which Janssen are       committed to helping people living with HIV in resource-limited settings       by ensuring effective and sustainable access to their HIV medicines (i).
Via GAPP regulatory filings are prioritised where there is public health       need.
Intelence&#174; has gained regulatory approval in 28 countries       (including South Africa, Thailand and Jamaica) with 9 additional filings       pending (as of May 2013).
Royalty-free licencing and distribution       agreements help ensure rapid availability, supply, and medically       appropriate use, along with a not-for-profit price.
Our role in the       regulatory approval of Intelence&#174; has therefore led to global       impact on health and welfare by significantly improving clinical outcomes       for patients with drug resistant HIV.
Following the collaboration with Nottingham, Janssen confirmed that "some         of the methodologies used have been adapted and are now used at Janssen         in developing similar formulations" (a), including telaprevir, a new       treatment for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (a).
Developed by Janssen in       collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma       (MTP), telaprevir gained regulatory approval in 2011, in the US (marketed       by Vertex as Incivek&#174;), in the EU (marketed by J&amp;J as       Incivo&#174;) and in Japan (marketed by MTP as Telavic&#174;)       (j).
Latest figures from the WHO show that approx.
150 million people       worldwide are chronically infected with HCV (WHO Hepatitis C Factsheet,       2012).
Telaprevir is a second generation treatment for HCV genotype 1 (the       most common genotype), which offers substantially better clinical outcomes       than standard treatment alone.
Combined results from three Phase III       clinical trials (named ADVANCE, ILLUMINATE, REALIZE, overall n=2290 (e))       showed that sustained viral response (viral cure) rates for telaprevir       compared to standard treatment were: 79% vs. 46% for previously untreated       patients; 84% vs. 22% for patients suffering a relapse; 61% vs. 15% for       partial responders; and 31% vs. 5% for null responders.
Treatment time in       certain patients could also be halved to 24 weeks, compared to standard       treatment.
Following EMA approval, Charles Gore of the World Hepatitis       Alliance said "[This] is the first treatment breakthrough in more than         10 years and a significant step forward for the hepatitis C community"       (e).
In its first full year on the market, telaprevir sales reached       $1.16bn in the US alone (Incivek&#174; sales and royalties from       Incivo&#174; made up 84% of Vertex's total revenue in 2012) (j).
J&amp;J have only highlighted Incivo&#174; sales since January 2013,       with current half year sales of $334M (f).
In summary, research carried out in the School of Pharmacy has enabled       Janssen to overcome formulation issues associated with poorly soluble       drugs and gain the first regulatory approvals of spray-dried solid       dispersion tablet formulations, in the HIV drug Intelence&#174; and       the Hepatitis C drug telaprevir.
These drugs both provide a step change in       treatment options resulting in significantly improved clinical outcomes       for patients and global impact on health and welfare.
Global Intelence&#174;       sales were $349M in 2012, while telaprevir sales (as Incivek&#174;)       reached over $1bn in the US alone.
