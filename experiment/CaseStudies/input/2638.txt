     Researchers at Glasgow have supported the efforts of local partnerships       to bring significant       financial investment to their communities: &#163;1.7 million to the Lomonds       area; and, &#163;2.8 million to the       Isle of Bute.
By means of guided walks, talks and training, they have       enabled communities to feel a       stronger sense of ownership of their historical landscape through the       analysis of place-names,       shedding light on social and cultural changes over the course of more than       a millennium.
Incorporation of place-name research into Heritage Landscape         Partnership funding bids       Heritage Landscape Partnerships (HLPs) are local initiatives funded       primarily by the UK Heritage       Lottery Fund, with considerable matched funding from other organisations,       to promote and       revitalise local landscapes and their communities.
Between 2009-13, the       UoG researchers       provided advice and expertise in support of two HLPs that incorporated       place-name strands into       their funding bids.
In 2008-9 Discover Bute secured &#163;2.8 million in HLP funding, including       &#163;1.8 million from the UK       Heritage Lottery Fund.
University of Glasgow researchers Butter and Taylor       provided valuable       support on how to undertake the place-name projects in the HLP bid,       providing a vision of how to       involve the community, shape and develop the project.
Gilbert M&#225;rkus went       on to implement the       place-name element of the project.
UoG is also a partner in the Living         Lomonds Landscape Partnership (LLLP), which was awarded       funding of &#163;1.7 million in July 2013.
UoG provided ancillary work as       in-kind matched funding, and       Taylor advised the LLLP's `Naming Your Place' sub-project in the bid,       which raised awareness of       place-names as part of the living heritage of the Lomonds.
The director of       the Falkland Centre for         Stewardship, one of the core partners in the LLLP says: `Exploring       the meaning of place names is       providing a tremendous way to engage communities in and around the Lomond       hills &#8212; and to       increase people's understanding of the nature, culture and history of this       landscape.
For LLLP, the       timeliness of the place names project and books has given a vital boost to       our engagement,       awareness raising and place-making work'.
Delivering place-name exploration engagement and community activities       UoG's HLP work with Discover Bute resulted in a process of data collection       by local residents that       represented a valuable interaction with the island community.
In 2010,       M&#225;rkus worked with around       30 Bute-based volunteers to survey place-names for the HLP, running       training workshops on the       international phonetic alphabet and how to record pronunciation;       instructions for the recording of       spatial data using maps and national grid reference system, and       etiquette/ethics of collectors.
The       training sessions also included a lecture which provided the volunteers       and project staff with a       framework for recognising the importance of different place-names.
M&#225;rkus       also engaged the local       community with three talks and a coach tour of the island with the Deputy       Project Manager for       Archaeology (c.50 people).
University of Glasgow researchers have also worked directly with local       communities to undertake       place-name walks, helping people to engage with the linguistic and       cultural heritage of local       landscapes.
- In 2010, M&#225;rkus carried out two place-name walks in Falkland for the       Falkland Centre for       Stewardship (c.20 walkers), preceded by talks and resulting in the       production of a booklet guide       now sold on the centre's website.
- Taylor and Clancy also carried out place-name walks in Markinch       (organised by the Markinch Heritage         Group) (c.25 walkers) and Aberdour (c.35 walkers) for Fife Council's       `Celebrating Fife'       year, with the popularity of these walks resulting in an invitation to       repeat the walk for the       Aberdour Festival in August 2012 (c.25 walkers).
- The Markinch Heritage Group have also employed their walk booklet as an       ongoing local       resource, with the format providing a template for subsequent walks       undertaken as part of the       STIT (Scottish         Toponymy in Transition) project on Scottish place-names, attracting       more than       100 attendees in total.
- Walks were also       delivered in collaboration with the Ochils         Landscape Partnership as part of the       Ochils Festival in June 2012 and 2013.
Further place-name activities have included information stalls at the Big       Tent Festival organised by       the Falkland Centre for Stewardship on 21-22 July 2012, a place-name       collecting workshop held       as part of the HLP supported community Hidden         Heritage Project in Arrochar (March 2013, 24       people), and a large variety of talks, book-launches and events such as       the Kinross 50+ group in       May 2013, a talk in Dollar Museum following a place-name walk and a place-name         walk in         Kinnesswood (June 2013) organised by the Kinross Museum and       Kinross-shire Historical Society       as part of STIT.
These projects have enabled local people to feed back into the process of       research, and also feel       a sense of ownership of their own heritage.
This experience of       contributing to the knowledge base       is extremely empowering for local communities.
