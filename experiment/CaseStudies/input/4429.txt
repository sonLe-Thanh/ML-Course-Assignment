     The concert protocols challenged by Hamilton's research, though of       comparatively recent vintage,       are deeply engrained.
Proof of their lack of historical foundation opened       up possibilities for more       interactive modes of engagement that have resonances also for modern       society.
The breadth and       depth of engagement with Hamilton's findings suggest that he has realised       a widely felt need for a       fresh approach to the repertory it addresses.
One significant area of impact has been the changed approaches of         concert pianists.
Between       2008 and July 2013 a number of top-flight pianists have taken on practices       based on Hamilton's       research in their concert performances and writings.
Prominent among these       is Vladimir Feltsman,       who, having read the book, began to introduce linking improvisations       between conventionally       discreet items of his concert programmes.
It was reported to Hamilton that       as a result of his book,       Feltsman had been `been making a habit of preluding... [he] did so [at a       Carnegie Hall concert in       December, 2008], with no pause between the two Liszt-arranged Schubert       songs or between       [Schubert's] Wohin and the [Liszt] Sonata' (see source 1 below).
Both Malcolm Bilson and       Stephen Hough have referred to the book in their own writings (Hough       example in source 2).
Hough and Steven Osborne (both international concert artists) have also       consulted Hamilton       personally to discuss the direct application of his research to their       playing, and have informed him       of their application of it in their concerts since 2008.
Cultural impact on public awareness and understanding of the original         performance         traditions of Romantic concert music is indicated primarily by the       book's high level of sales, far       beyond that normally expected for an academic work (source 1).
Following       an extensive leading       feature in the Arts Section of The New York Times early in 2008,       entitled "Concertgoers: Please       Clap, Shout or Talk At Any Time", After the Golden Age became for       a period one of the best-selling       music titles in the United States.
According to Oxford University Press,       it was in January 2008       selling around 64 copies per day on Amazon.com alone.
Between January 2008       and July 2013       various music critics referred to Hamilton's research in reference to the       assessment of classical       music performances (for example Martin Kettle reviewing Daniel Barenboim       in Prospect Magazine       in February 2008, and Alexandra Alter on new approaches to classical       improvisation in the Wall         Street Journal in November 2008, the latter written after a       telephone interview with Hamilton &#8212; sources       3 and 4).
Quotes from and references to After the Golden Age have       featured on the       websites of orchestras, festivals and piano competitions, including those       of the Los Angeles       Chamber Orchestra, the Festival for Creative Pianists in the US, and the       Portland International       Piano Festival.
Discussions of its conclusions have and continue to appear       on websites devoted to       classical music performance, including the Classical Music Guide,       The San Francisco Classical         Voice, Piano Street and Stereophile (examples sources 5 and       6 from 2008 and 2013 respectively).
The international reach of the research can be further demonstrated by       the level of media attention       attracted by After the Golden Age, in both the general and       specialist press and broadcast media.
In       the UK, it was a Daily Telegraph `Book of the Year' for 2008 ('the       most irresistible music book I       read this year", according to Damian Thompson).
In 2008, reviews appeared       in an extensive range       of non-academic publications in addition to The New York Times,       including the The Guardian, The         Independent, The Birmingham Post, The Times Literary Supplement,         The Wall Street Journal, The         New Yorker, The Toronto Star, The Buffalo News, the Frankfurter         Allgemeine Zeitung, The         Gramophone, Classic FM Magazine, Symphony Magazine, Chamber Music         Magazine, The Oldie,         Wholenote Magazine, La scena musicale, Piano Magazine, The Arts         Journal, Netherlands Radio 4,         Piano Journal and Commentary Magazine.
In July 2010,       material from the book was extensively       featured in a heated debate on the future of Classical Music between       journalists Heather       Macdonald and Greg Sandow, carried on in the pages of the New York City         Journal and the US       Arts Journal.
Indeed, the initial City Journal article by       Heather Macdonald ("Classical Music's New       Golden Age") was partly catalysed by Hamilton's book, which she called "a       mesmerizing study".
Hamilton was consulted by Macdonald before the publication of this       article, and he gave her further       supporting historical information (source 7).
Since the publication of the book, Hamilton has been interviewed about       the significance of his work       for the transformation of current concert-giving practices by radio       stations in the UK (Radio 3),       Canada (CBC), the US (WQXR: New York Public Radio), Singapore (Radio       Singapore       International) and Australia (ABC, repeated a year after its first       airing).
He has also himself       appeared as a pianist and presenter on the Deutsche Welle       television Channel (2009) in a       broadcast syndicated in both Europe and the US, and on Turkish Television.
Cultural impact produced by Hamilton's book has thus been channelled       through both print and       broadcast media, aided by specific and directed knowledge-transfer       activity when he was working       in the University of Birmingham Music Department (until October 2012).
Hamilton gave regular       lecture-recitals in the Barber Institute of Fine Arts by means of which he       presented his research to       a broad public.
He repeated some of these lecture-recitals at music       festivals throughout the world.
In the 2008-2013 period, these included the "Beethoven Unwrapped" Festival       in London's King's       Place Concert Hall and the International Chopin and Liszt Forums in       London's Purcell Room (2010       and 2011).
Hamilton has performed in the Esplanade, Singapore (the       country's main concert       venue), every year since 2005, which has led to repeated coverage in the       Far East of both his       academic and practical work, most notably in the Singapore Straits         Times, on Singapore Radio,       and even in the China Times.
These concerts included practical       demonstrations of the art of       preluding and transitioning described in After the Golden Age&#8212;indeed,       one of the Straits Times       reviews drew specific attention to this.
Hamilton additionally made a       number of international       appearances, for example: the world premieres (2009) of Hamilton's       reconstructed edition of       Liszt's Hexameron for piano and orchestra in Philadelphia with the       Philadelphia Classical       Symphony; and of the original (manuscript) version of Liszt's Sextet for       Piano and Strings (2009).
The versions of the pieces played in these concerts had been reconstructed       in the light of the       research in After the Golden Age.
The research has informed teaching and students in the Higher         Education sector through       Hamilton's invitations to give guest lectures, lecture-recitals and       masterclasses since the       publication of the book.
Audiences on these occasions have comprised not       only pianists, and       indeed not only music students, but also a large cross-section of the       substantial music-loving       public familiar with the kind of repertoire on which Hamilton's research       bears.
Events of this nature       took place at such institutions as the Royal Academy of Music in London       (annually since 2010),       The Royal Northern College of Music (29/2/12), Bath Spa University       (1/12/10), Middlesex       University (14/10/9), Goldsmiths' College, London (1/5/12), Royal       Holloway, London (7/2/12),       Kings College, London (18/1/12), Yonsei University in Seoul, Korea       815/11/11), the Singapore       Teachers' Academy for the Arts (STAR) (4-5/4/12), the New England       Conservatory, Boston, US       (9/711), Brown University, Providence, US (4/11/11), the University of       Minho, Portugal (26/3/12),       Musikeon Conservatory, Valencia, Spain (12-14/5/10), and other       institutions worldwide.
In summary, then, Hamilton's study and the events that have       emerged from it have made, and       continue to make, an impact across the HE sector, on professional       practitioners and critics, and on       general public awareness of a centrally popular sector of the classical       concert repertoire.
It has,       consequently, had a significant role in "preserving, conserving and       presenting cultural heritage" in       music.
