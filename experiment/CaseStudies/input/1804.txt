     Improved clinical practice, diagnostic accuracy and public awareness         in relation to GJB2       and hearing loss     Since GJB2 accounts for up to 50% of genetic hearing loss, most       clinical genetic services and       commercial testing companies now offer GJB2 testing, including       23andMe, University of Chicago       Genetic Services, University of Iowa, ARUP Laboratories, Greenwood Genetic       Centre, Knight       Diagnostic Centre, Harvard Medical School, Athean Diagnostics and       Centogene.
In addition,       bloodspot-based genetic testing for GJB2 alleles can provide a       means for rapid confirmation in the       subset of infants who fail bedside newborn hearing tests [7].
In a US       study in 2000, eight       participating laboratories provided GJB2 testing to approximately       230 families per month [8].
These       studies have led to a number of additional impacts:            Improved medical and scientific awareness and knowledge of GJB2         mutations as a major         underlying cause of congenital hearing loss [9].
Changes in clinical practice and molecular diagnosis:       a.
Early diagnosis allows for early intervention such as cochlear         implants in patients with         GJB2 associated hearing loss.
In the UK for example, 1,650 GJB2         tests were performed in         2010-2011 according to the Clinical Molecular Genetics Society Audit         [10].
Delayed         diagnosis of hearing loss in infants may have a harmful effect on         social, emotional,         cognitive, and academic development.
A genetic diagnosis provides key         information for         genetic counseling, including prognosis and recurrence risk.
For         example, not all GJB2-associated         hearing loss presents at birth [11].
b.
A positive diagnosis helps rule out other diseases, including Ushers         Syndrome.
Genetic testing as described above is now recommended as the gold         standard by the         European Molecular Genetics Quality Network, and laboratories that         follow this guidance can         seek a formal certificate of quality [12].
Improved clinical and genetics information on GJB2-associated         hearing loss for patients with         hearing loss and their families via websites, leaflets and similar         material [13].
Improved diagnosis, management, prenatal diagnosis and awareness of           Harlequin         ichthyosis     Kelsell et al's 2005 discovery of recessive ABCA12 mutations as       the major cause of this       devastating and often life threatening skin condition has led to a number       of impacts: 	       Molecular diagnosis.
The team has developed into a major global       referral centre for HI in the       eight-year period since they discovered the HI gene.
Over 130 families       from the UK, Europe,       Africa and Asia have been sent for ABCA12 genetic analysis to this       laboratory for molecular       diagnosis.
In 98% of these cases, ABCA12 mutations were identified.
For       many of the samples       from overseas there is often no financial support for the HI families to       cover the genetic test       and in these cases Kelsell's team do the tests at no cost to the family.
Importantly, they have       developed genetic screening strategies such as copy number arrays,       targeted and exome high       throughput sequencing to increase accuracy of mutation detection and       increase turnaround       time (within three months), which is critical for many HI families.
Last       year, they performed       genetic analysis on eleven HI families, mainly from Pakistan, India and       Iran.
For UK, Europe       and the US, the ABCA12 genetic test is now an established service in       general clinical genetic /       skin disease laboratories.
Pre-natal diagnosis (in excess of 20 HI families by this laboratory)       based on the genetic       findings.
As predicted, in around 75% of cases, the test indicated that       the mother was carrying       a child that would not develop HI, and this was of great reassurance to       the family.
Furthermore,       the team has performed what is believed to be the first case of       pre-implantation genetic       diagnosis for this condition, allowing the single genetically unaffected       embryo to be selected       from nine fertilised eggs, hence producing a child who was not only       phenotypically normal but       who was not even a carrier of the condition.
This clinical application was       published as an online       communication by Barts Charity [14].
Data to support specific changes to clinical management.
As the team       had access to a large       cohort of HI families (due to families requesting genetic testing), the       team were able to perform       the first large-scale study of HI, providing important prognostic       information for clinicians and       affected families.
Previously the only clinical information were       individual case reports       describing neonatal lethality.
The large number of HI families in this       study published in the       Archives of Dermatology (reference 6 above) provided huge insights into       biology of this severe       skin disease including that nearly 50% of HI babies in our study survived       (eg retinoids give       86% survival).
Patient and public awareness.
Kelsell et al's work on HI has       been a component in three TV       documentaries (ITV, Channel 5 and Discovery) shown worldwide [15] and also       as an       interactive learning tool within Centre of the Cell, QMUL's interactive       science education centre       [16].
