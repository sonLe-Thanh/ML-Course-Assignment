     Wright's research has impacted upon the performance           practices of contemporary music ensembles and soloists through         i) the use of turntablist techniques, and ii) the         development of innovative techniques of real-time and           studio-based dialogue between open-form compositional         structures, improvisation and sampling technology.
Wright's research into turntablism within         contemporary composition was cited by Eric Sleichim, Artistic Director         of the Brussels-based Bl!ndman ensemble, in an interview The Beauty of         the Mechanical (November 2011).
He states: "[...] at a certain moment, I         saw a work by Matthew Wright, Contact Theatre, and that used real         turntables.
[...] when I heard Matt`s work, I was suddenly tempted for         the first time to start using professional turntables.
[...] In Matt         Wright's hands the turntable became a real tool, something to work with.
There is a sort of abstraction of emotion when you are working with that         instrument.
[...] And that appealed to me enormously in that work."
Since working with Wright, turntables are now a standard feature of the         ensemble's instrumental line up, and the ensemble has performed Wright's         works (including Totem for Brussels) 26 times to approximately 1,500         people, thus significantly contributing to their repertoire and         professional practice.
Similarly Totem for Gobi-New York was         commissioned by the MATA festival in New York due to Wright's innovative         research into applications of turntablism.
On commissioning the work,         MATA's Artistic Director, Chris McIntyre stated: "We are well aware of         your work with turntables [...] Our panelists were impressed by the         originality of your concepts and for the unique audience experience they         engender."
Wright's research into techniques of real-time and           studio-based dialogue between open-form compositional         structures, improvisation and sampling technology during the Trance Map         project led world-leading saxophonist Evan Parker to state that "Matt's         facility with the various DSP programmes used totally blurs the         distinction between playing, mixing and editing" and led to the         development of a new performance practice between them.
The research led         Wright and Parker to be engaged as UK representatives on the artistic         staff of `Labo', a week-long series of workshops organized by the Champ         d'Action contemporary music ensemble for young performing artists from         across Europe (Antwerp, February 2013).
Wright's research has further         impacted on the training of the next generation of composers and         performers through invitations to speak about his work within the         assessment period at The Peabody Institute, Baltimore; The Royal         Conservatory of The Netherlands; The Catholic University of Leuven,         Belgium; The Polish Academy of Music, Krakow; The Royal Academy of         Music; The Royal College of Music; Trinity College of Music; Goldsmiths         College; The University of East Anglia.
Wright's research has impacted upon the programming           practices of festivals and venues through i) the use of         the internet as a navigable `venue' for         interactive installations, ii) the development of the `club           installation' as a new form of presentation for         contemporary composition and iii) the development of innovative         techniques to achieve a dialogue between multichannel sonic           art techniques and traditional non-western instruments and         instrumental techniques.
The `club installation' and use of the      	internet as a navigable `venue' (each a means by which new         work is presented beyond the traditional concert format) have proved         notable sources of impact.
Totem for Gobi-New York, built around a         navigable website projection, was installed within Le Poisson Rouge, one         of the foremost contemporary nightclubs in New York, and received         widespread recognition.
Steven Smith wrote in the New York Times ("Music         With and Without Musicians" (21/04/10)) that "Inspired by a trek through         the Gobi Desert, Mr. Wright used a turntable, a laptop computer and         other effects to blend the recorded chanting and growling of Mongolian         singers, pealing and scraping bell sounds, vinyl crackle and electronic         rumble, all played through speakers positioned around the room.
Even         with synthetic sounds in the mix, the piece evoked a wind-swept,         spirit-haunted expanse, an effect bolstered by Gobi images projected and         altered on two video screens."
The Chamber Music Today website         (20/04/10) stated "The work is a fluid and immersive environment [...]         [an] imaginative musical meditation about the future of the natural         world, faced with the challenges of human population and global         development."
Wright's sound design for the Inside / Outside project created a         distinctive dialogue between acoustic Vietnamese instruments           and a multichannel sonic art installation.
Le Huong wrote         in the Viet Nam News ("Artists explore gender identity" (08/11/12))         "When the audience move through the space, reflections from the glass         create a perception of being both inside and outside the boxes, and         there is a constant shifting of instrumental and electronic sounds [...]         Next to the glass boxes there are headphones through which audience         members can listen to the music being played in each individual box.
Through these layers of sound, the audience can explore yet another         facet of how inside and outside is created."
The international reach of Wright's work, and its dissemination         through both traditional and non-traditional modes of musical         presentation have allowed it to achieve a substantive impact upon the           public understanding and appreciation of new forms of contemporary           music.
Totem for Den Haag, for example, was commissioned by         Ensemble Klang and was chosen by the artistic directors of three         European music festivals to represent the UK in an initiative between         the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, The Transit Festival         (Leuven, Belgium) and The November Music Festival (Den Bosch, Holland).
It was subsequently presented at the Transit Festival (23/10/10), at The         November Music Festival (13/11/10) and to a sold out audience at the         Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival (27/11/10).
In addition, that         work was chosen by artistic director Tino Haenan to open the Listen to         This concert series at the prestigious Muziekgebouw aan`t Ij in         Amsterdam (16/09/11).
Before commissioning Totem for Sydney, the         Australian Ensemble Offspring chose an earlier work of Wright's         (Breakdown, 2006) to represent the UK within a concert of radical new         works at the Sydney Opera House (30/03/12).
Following this connection to         Australia, Wright's research became the subject of a two-hour radio show         broadcast on ABC Classic FM (Off the Record 01/12/12).
In total, Wright's practice-based compositional research undertaken       within the UoA has led to 135 live performances of his work between       01/01/08 and 31/07/13, reaching an estimated live audience of 7,500.
His       CD created with Ensemble Klang, `Music at The Edge of Collapse' has sold       approximately 150 copies, contributing approximately 2,250EUR of sales to       Ensemble Klang, whilst the works have been streamed from the website       approximately 4,000 times.
In relation to that album, the Instant Jazz       Website (17/01/2011) claimed that "the recently released collaboration [of       Ensemble Klang] with Matthew Wright (Music           At The Edge Of Collapse) [...] combines contemporary       sound art with electronics into something wholly modern.
It may not be       jazz, but these artists are creating cutting edge music that ensures a       unique aural experience, introducing new ways of dealing with       composing/playing, fusing the familiar with the aesthetically challenging       and taking the listener straight into the future.
It's an entirely       different excitement and something we really recommend to adventurous       listeners!"
