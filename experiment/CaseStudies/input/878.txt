     Scott's expertise in Victorian and Edwardian popular music [1],       [2] informs the content and form of national television programmes.
Scott was a principal contributor to a BBC Four documentary, The         Story of the Music Hall (first broadcast 25 October 2011), the       producer of which stressed that Scott's "research into the history       of pop music, the laws around music halls as venue and issues of class and       race was incredibly useful," while "his input was invaluable in       establishing many of the details of our programme and the accuracy of the       narrative", which, combined with "infectious" enthusiasm "will have       deepened the audience's understanding of the material" [A], The       Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB) statistics show that in the       week of broadcast (24-30 October 2011), BBC Four had an average daily       audience of 2.275 million.
Scott's research was also central to       further documentaries, including Titanic: A Commemoration in Music and         Film (first broadcast: BBC Two, 14 April 2012), Let's Have a         Party!
The Piano Genius of Mrs Mills!
(first broadcast: BBC Four, 23       September 2012), and Len Goodman's Dancing Feet (first broadcast:       BBC Four, 27 December 2012).
This last focussed on the early       twentieth-century `golden age' of ballroom dancing.
The producer of the       programme states that he was "aware of [Scott's] long academic       back-catalogue", and it was this that enabled Scott to bring       "insight to the story-telling that neither Len or ourselves could bring to       the table."

(Scott has been re-engaged as consultant       and participant for Len Goodman's Dance Band Days, a factual       documentary on British dance bands of the 1920s and 1930s commissioned by       BBC Four, filmed through the latter half of 2013, and due for broadcast at       Christmas with the possibility of a two-page publicity spread in The         Radio Times).
Many of Scott's contributions to The Victorian Web [4]       attract considerable attention, which reflect Scott's efforts to       enhance understanding of significant pieces of Victorian popular music.
For example, Scott's recording of `Woodman, Spare that Tree' has       been uploaded to YouTube, where it has received over 14,000 views to date       [C].
George P. Landow, Editor in Chief of The Victorian Web,       considers that Scott's contributions play "an important part in       crucial experiments about the form of the future scholarly book and its       role in sharing information outside the university" [J].
Scott's       presentation of the popular music of the period as an international       phenomenon (rather than just a Victorian one) [1], [2],       and recognition as the leading expert on nineteenth-century popular music,       has allowed him to promote understanding of musics that were truly       `popular' before `pop music'.
In 2010 Scott was invited to speak       at the Bard Music Festival, to develop understanding of the history of       music amongst contemporary audiences.
Scott's findings on Viennese       popular music and operetta [1] enabled him to show the influence       of these on Alban Berg, the featured composer at Bard that year.
Similarly, in 2012 he delivered public introductions to performances of Die         Fledermaus for the Canadian Opera Company&#8212;the largest opera company       in Canada and the third largest producer of opera in North America&#8212;as well       as discussing the intersection of `high' and `low' art for performances by       the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera Company at Buxton Opera House in the UK [3].
Scott's work on the representation of national identity embedded       in musical styles, as exemplified in the Eurovision Song Contest [5],       has drawn a wide audience.
In 2011 Scott appeared on (and was       tweeted about by) Today (BBC Radio 4) [D], Breakfast       (BBC One) [E], and BBC News Online [F].
Breakfast's       viewing figures were approximately 1.6 million a day, while Today       had a daily audience of over 7 million at this time according to BARB and       RAJAR (Radio Audience Research).
With retweets, Today's tweet       about Scott's research reached a total audience via Twitter alone of       240,000.
The research reached international audiences, garnering interest       in Russian-speaking countries in the wake of Azerbaijan's win [G]       (the report notes his identification of "serious political and moral       ideas" in Eurovision successes).
Such conceptions of representation and nationhood provide a broader       context for Scott to inform and influence the reception of music through       the media, speaking about notions of orientalism in music [5] for       Chopsticks at Dawn (first broadcast: BBC Radio 4, 8 June 2010), the       meaning and function of national anthems and international `identity' [6]       for Something Understood (first broadcast: BBC Radio 4, 20 January       2013), a feature of Scott's research that had previously interested The         Guardian [H], and in interview with Time Out Delhi [I],       discussing John Pridham's 1857 `The Battle March of Delhi' in the context       of the Indian uprising, with Scott referencing the       nineteenth-century rift between `high art' and entertainment [2].
The same feature linked to Scott's performance of the piece on The         Victorian Web, claiming that "whenever Scott performs the piece       live, people fall about laughing, and usually don't stop until it's over.'
