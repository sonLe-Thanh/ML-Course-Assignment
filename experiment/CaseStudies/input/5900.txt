     The research directly resulted in changes in UK government policy and       improved forecasts of air quality made available to the public.
In the UK,       air pollutants reduce lifespan on average by 8-14 months, and by up to 9       years for the most vulnerable groupings, inducing respiratory and       pulmonary diseases that affect disproportionately the elderly and       children.
Health costs are estimated to be &#163;10.7 billion per annum5       and are comparable to those of alcohol and drug misuse.
Vulnerable people       are advised to consult air quality forecasts, as illustrated by the Met       Office and Asthma Society:6 "If you find pollution triggers         your asthma, keep well informed about air quality.
Ozone can be a         problem for some people.
Levels are likely to be higher on hot summer         days."
Air pollution also causes ecological damage and reduces crop       yields.
The connection between heat-waves and air pollution and their       impacts on the population reached wide attention during summer 2003, a       period that led to several thousand additional deaths throughout Europe       attributable to ozone and fine particulates.7 The event       catalysed public debate on the effects of air pollution, the possible       impacts of a warmer climate and the effectiveness of Government policy for       pollution control.
In response, DEFRA collaborated with the York team to       improve their capability for prediction of air quality.
This collaboration       began in 2003 and continues, most recently during the heat-wave of July       2013.
The government has benefited from clear scientific evidence for the       causes of continuing peak summertime ozone pollution, and an enhanced       appreciation of the limitations of EU control policies in periods of high       temperatures.
The inclusion of biogenic species in predictive models has       provided government with an improved capability to forecast air quality in       the short term,8 and provided advice to the public (for example       through DEFRA and Met Office air quality forecasts).
It has also improved       estimates of future changes in air pollution of natural origin and those       arising through policy change.
There is now a better appreciation of the       balance between the effects of natural and man-made emissions on air       quality.
Since controlling anthropogenic emissions is a costly activity,       the benefits of improved prediction are felt in both health and financial       domains.
Section 2 presented the finding from York that biogenic volatile organic       compounds are released in large quantities from vegetation in the UK on       hot summer days, promoting rapid photochemical formation of ozone.
The       natural emissions offset some of the benefits from policies to reduce man-       made VOCs from sources such as combustion and solvent usage.
York       scientists calculated the impacts of biogenics on air quality using their       unique measurements and supporting data from other HEIs.
The research data collected by York were shared within months with the       evidence team at DEFRA, the Government department responsible for ensuring       UK compliance with European legislation, and specifically the air quality       Directive 2008/50/EC.
At the same time there was substantial media       reporting and debate about the research.9 Peer-reviewed       publications from York followed in 2005 and 2006.2,3 These       academic publications were then used by DEFRA as a key part of the       evidence base that guided the terms of reference for two Government       reports.
It is through these reports published in 2008 and 2009, and       on-going policy recommendations and practice changes, that the impacts of       the research in this assessment period are seen.
The first DEFRA expert report on the impacts of climate change on air       pollution appeared in 200810 and a second reporting on ozone in       the UK appeared in 2009.11 In addition, DEFRA called an expert       meeting in 2009.12 Both reports made substantial reference to       the original underpinning research, highlighting the impacts that this new       understanding of natural emissions may have on air quality, and how       climate change may exacerbate this process."
The drought conditions         accompanying the episode (summer 2003) decreased deposition of ozone to         vegetation, while the high temperatures led to increased emissions of         isoprene, a highly reactive volatile organic compound that is emitted         from vegetation, and is an ozone precursor.
Both of these effects         further contributed to the high ozone concentrations."
10       Both Government reports made reference to the need to improve the       representation of biogenic species in UK emissions models in the light of       the York research.
In 2010, DEFRA tendered for an update of the reporting       of natural VOC emissions for the UK, and the models used for national       policy development continue to be updated to include this source.
This key       change to represent natural VOC emissions in the models used by Government       for future scenario testing has embedded the original research in all       future policy formulations.
Specific direct consequences are: (a) DEFRA       contracted the consultancy Ricardo-AEA (http://www.ricardo-aea.com)       to include natural emissions in future air quality predictions, work that       is on-going; (b) the Met Office is including natural emissions in the       models used for their air-quality forecasts for the public (http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/guide/weather/air-quality).
Activities supporting DEFRA air-quality evidence and policy requirements       continue to the present.
Lewis is a current member of the Government       Expert Committee, the Air Quality Expert Group.
DEFRA continues to support       a range of air pollution and emissions research projects at York Chemistry       with Lewis, Lee and Hamilton.
In 2012, DEFRA and York created a new       permanent staff position split between Whitehall and York to accelerate       the translation of NERC air quality science outcomes into government       departments (Dr Sarah Moller).
Quotations: Dr Tim Murrells, Technical Director, National Atmospheric       Emissions Inventory, Ricardo-AEA (05/04/13) "The research project         TORCH, led by Prof. Lewis at University of York, provided a very         detailed chemical analysis of processes occurring in the UK during very         high temperature conditions.
The research, and later DEFRA expert         publications, highlighted that natural organic emissions of isoprene         could elevate UK ozone during very warm weather.
In response, there is         now a programme of work, commissioned by DEFRA and led by Ricardo-AEA,         to provide recommendations on approaches for estimating biogenic         emissions inventories and their use in models to support air pollution         prediction and forecasting.
Ricardo-AEA includes biogenic inventories in         its Ozone Source Receptor Model which is used to predict future ozone         concentrations in the UK and to inform DEFRA's policies on ozone air         quality by predicting the impacts of future changes in precursor         emissions.
Ricardo-AEA also uses this information in models used for         DEFRA's daily forecasts and public alert systems on air pollution for         the protection of human health.
"13     Dr Chris Jones, Head, Earth System and Mitigation Science, Met Office       Hadley Centre (22/04/13): "In part due to NERC-funded TORCH campaign,         the Met Office has developed global and regional chemistry climate         models which include detailed process-based representations of the         dependence of isoprene emissions on temperature and light levels.
This         emissions scheme will shortly be included in our air quality forecast         model which provides daily forecasts of ozone and other pollutants for         the UK and has been demonstrated to improve the ability of the model to         represent ozone levels during period of elevated pollution.
The work         carried out during the TORCH campaign both improved our understanding of         the role of isoprene in European and UK ozone episodes and also provided         a driver to ensure that these processes are fully considered by Air         Quality models for the UK.
The campaign was therefore a very valuable         contribution to improving our understanding of air pollution and in         furthering our ability to model future air pollution events.
"13     Stephen Elderkin, Deputy Director Analysis and Evidence, DEFRA (1/10/13).
"Summer 2003 resulted in a period of poor air quality with impacts on         health across Southern England and in many other parts of Europe.
Understanding the causes of poor air quality events such as this is of         great importance to Defra.
The NERC TORCH project has been a         particularly useful scientific resource in understanding the detailed         chemistry occurring during very high temperature conditions in the         UK.....The improvements to model chemistry resulting from the findings         of the TORCH campaign on the significance of natural organic emissions         have led to an improved ability to forecast high ozone events and         therefore provide appropriate guidance and warnings to the public.
It         has also led to an improvement in our ability to project future         concentrations of ozone reducing uncertainty in evidence to support         decisions on the scale and nature of measures required to tackle air         pollution."
