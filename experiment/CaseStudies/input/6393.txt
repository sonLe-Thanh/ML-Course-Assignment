     The impacts outlined here are upon the practice and policy of arts       organisations in relation to collecting and exhibiting new media art, and       hence concern the economic impact on artists and the benefits to       audiences.
CRUMB has developed a long-term strand of research concerning collecting       art.
The Exhibitions Officer at Harris Museum and Art Gallery has       been developing the exhibition, audience development and collection of new       media art at a regional art museum for over 10 years, forging a strong       national identity for the museum, with ongoing support from CRUMB(1).
Graham was involved in developing the Digital Aesthetic conference       and exhibition at the Harris in 2001, and 2007.
In 2010 the Exhibitions       Officer attended the Commissioning &amp; Collecting Variable Media       CRUMB/CAS conference at BALTIC, which specifically aimed to develop the       collection of new media art in the UK, and was attended by 100 national       and international curators (2).
In 2011, the Harris collaborated with       digital arts commissioning agency folly on Current: an         experiment in collecting digital art project.
Cook was invited to       serve on the Board of folly, and Graham was invited to be on the       exhibition selection panel, and co-chaired with Cook the symposium Collecting         Digital Art at Harris.
The project was an integrated approach       informed by the Commissioning &amp; Collecting Variable Media       event, and the research of the unit, involving an open call for works,       selection of exhibition, followed by selection of one work from the       exhibition to collect.
Importantly, audience views on which artwork should       be collected were taken into account as well as expert panels (the       audience and the experts agreed, and the work selected was a work by       Thomson and Craighead using live data pulled from the internet &#8212; a       conceptually and technologically complex work).
This reflects much CRUMB       research on the importance of audience in curating new media art.
The long-term support of CRUMB contributed to changing the collection       policy of the museum to specifically include new media art (Harris 2011,       p.62): the first moving image piece entered the Harris collection in 2000,       and the first new media artwork entered the collection in 2012, by Thomson       and Craighead.
The institutional structure for acquisition changed by       involving a panel of judges, technical staff, and the audience itself, in       the selection of works to collect.
CAS and The Art Fund supported the Current       project, and in May 2013 further awarded &#163;30,000 to the Harris to collect       more new media art (CAS 2011).
Acquisition fees were &#163;10,000 for Current       alone, and so economic impact was felt by organisations and artists.
Graham was invited to chair a panel on new media art including the       Exhibitions Officer at the 2010 Museums Association Conference, and the       Exhibitions Officer was also invited by Graham to write a chapter for the       forthcoming book New Collecting: Exhibiting and Audiences after New         Media Art (Taylor 2014), in order to share the curatorial knowledge       more widely and hence further impact on the policy of other curators.
Graham was interviewed by the Financial Times: How to Spend It       magazine concerning collecting, and highlighted the Harris' policy,       including economic impact (Crichton-Miller 2012).
New media art is increasingly being collected by both commercial       and museums, and CRUMB has been involved in many events aimed to impact       upon this: For example, the Professional Development Seminar on         Documenting New Media Art in 2008 with curator and archivist Caitlin       Jones (formerly of Guggenheim Museum, NY) highlighted that, like live art,       documentation of new media art is collected as well as the art itself.
The       workshop sold out, and included international contemporary art curators,       Arts Council England and British Council, as well as academics and       artists.
Feedback forms from the event stated that 98% of attendees felt       that their future practice would be changed by the workshop.
In 2011 a New       York collector and a UK investor met with CRUMB to consult on setting up a       new selling gallery in London: Carroll / Fletcher gallery in W1       now successfully sells artworks including Thomson and Craighead's.
The British         Council has consulted with CRUMB concerning national policies for       collecting new media art (5).
Beryl Graham was an invited member of the Tate         New Media Art Network on Authenticity and Performativity, which       impacted collection of new media art at Tate (2009).
She has also advised       the Curator of Digital Design at V&amp;A on their first exhibition       of new media art and design &#8212; Decode, and was invited to speak at       their Decoding the Digital national conference (4).
Graham is on       the Project Advisory Board of EU project PERICLES on digital       preservation, based at Tate (3).
