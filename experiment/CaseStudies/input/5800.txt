     Application of our research results with industrial sponsors in UK,       Egypt, China, India, France, Norway, Brazil, Trinidad and the USA has       resulted in tangible impacts in the subsurface.
We take three specific       examples.
Working with BP, our research has facilitated their in-house analysis of       a number of significant oil &amp; gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico.
BP has       confirmed that the research "has provided quantitative data on the         geometries of sand and shale bodies in outcrop.
These can be combined         with our subsurface data to help estimate hydrocarbon volumes and build         reservoir models.
A good example is the relationship between bed         thickness and net sand variations in levees.
This data has been used in         areas where we have reservoirs in levee systems".
BP have further added that "the consortia is a prolific source of new         ideas and concepts for us.
This allows us to understand the range of         possibilities in a system and have a more comprehensive appreciation of         the uncertainties in the reservoir system.
These ideas can be built, in         an appropriate way, into our development plans for a field.
Good         examples are the range of facies and stratigraphic architecture in         channel systems the team have documented; and the effect that Mass         Transport Complexes can have on reservoir distribution particularly         ponding and erosion" [c2].
The recognition that turbidite sandstones may be ponded on the surface of       submarine mass transport deposits has substantially influenced the       understanding of reservoir geometries in, for example, offshore Sabah       (Murphy Oil), and in the Nile Cone, offshore Egypt (BG).
Our work on the formation and distribution of sand within submarine       levees (Birman et al., 2009) contributed to tens of millions of barrels of       additional estimated hydrocarbon reserves in levees within the Krishna       Godavari basin, offshore eastern India for BG, and assisted in a negative       development decision in offshore Egypt (Hess) with a probable saving of       hundreds of millions of dollars on the bottom line.
The algorithm on which       these predictions are based is being used to develop a plug-in for       Schlumberger's Petrel seismic interpretation platform, in partnership with       Brazilian collaborators at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; this       represents the first such tool for estimating reservoir in levees.
As well as the application offshore India, BG have used the results of       funded research to examine producing fields of West Delta Deep Marine       (WDDM) off the Nile Delta in Egypt.
The Head of Geology for BG Group, has       clarified: "Two examples of specific impact [...] occurred in Egypt         activities since 2010.
The first example was applied during         re-evaluation of producing WDDM gas fields and re-building of reservoir         models to better match production history and constrain future         production forecast.
Building on field observations from Slopes JIP         research, Professor Kneller had developed a geological model where         rugosity on the top of mass transport deposits controls distribution of         subsequent turbidite sands, reservoir thickness and aquifer         distribution.
This model provide an explanation for the observation of         perched aquifers inferred from static reservoir pressure data.
The model         [...] was incorporated into the reservoir model re-builds with         improvements in the accuracy of perched aquifer volumes.
As a         consequence of the appreciation of considerable volume in several         perched aquifers, production strategy was updated to increase the         stand-off of well completions from the aquifer.
This helped sustain         production from the WDDM fields and contribute to BG Group net         production in Egypt in 2010 of 48.1 million barrels of oil equivalent."
BG have gone on to confirm that research findings have also helped in       decision making for placement of development wells (at a cost of $5       million each) to access additional zones in levee facies, allowing access       to an additional several billion cubic feet of gas     2.
Internationalisation/training impact       Apart from our contributions to understanding of deep marine processes and       architecture, we have also been instrumental in the development of two       multi-million pound collaborative research programmes between Aberdeen and       two Brazilian universities ("Integrated       Stratigraphic-Sedimentologic-Petrologic Study of the Clastic Rift Sections       of Santos and Campos Basins, Eastern Brazil", at Universidade Federal do       Rio Grande do Sul; and "Late Paleozoic de-glacial deposits in the Paran&#225;       Basin (Brazil) and their analogue in the Paganzo Basin (Argentina):       impacts on reservoir prediction" at Universidade do Vale do Rio Sinos).
These are funded by BG under the Brazilian government's `Special       Participation' scheme, based on a production levy, and were designed to       inform BG's exploration strategy, specifically within the Santos and       Paran&#225; basins (offshore and onshore Brazil respectively).
We were also       central to the creation and development of the world's first PhD program       under Brazil's Science without Borders initiative; "International Mobility       Training &amp; Research in Sedimentary Systems".
Ours is also the first       deep-water research group outside China (and one of the first geoscience       research groups of any kind) to receive research funding from PetroChina;       this will directly influence their deep-water exploration strategy in the       South China Sea and offshore Burma.
BP have taken advantage of staff training and development to learn from       the results of research.
BP confirm that "the work of the Aberdeen         consortia is built into our general geoscience in-house         training/learning through a wide range of mechanisms.
All of these         approaches contribute to building our geoscience capability.
Principal         Investigators give talks at the UK and Houston offices every year.
These         talks are broadcast via net-meeting to all BP locations around the         world.
Prof Ben Kneller and other principal investigators regularly meet         with members of the different asset teams particularly in Aberdeen,         Cairo, London, and the Houston offices.
During these one-on-one meetings         the BP employees can share the problems they are facing in evaluating         the subsurface.
Prof Kneller has led core workshops in the Cairo and         Aberdeen offices, and material generated from the consortia are         routinely incorporated into in-house formal geoscience training courses         by BP instructors" [2].
We introduced the concept of internships for earth science PhD students       to BG Group, one of our primary sponsors over the past eight years, which       has resulted in a significant change in the way they recruit PhD       graduates.
We have been involved in coaching and training in these new       approaches for many sponsor companies (field training, core workshops,       short courses, in-house coaching).
BG have further applied learnings from       their WDDM evaluation described above, passing these to the BG team       exploring and appraising fields offshore Tanzania, "which currently         (2013) stand at 8 successful wells and confirmation of around 13         trillion cubic feet of gross recoverable resources".
The standing of our work has been recognised by a Scottish Offshore       Achievement Award in 2009, and by a Scotland-China Higher Education       Research Partnership award from the Chinese and Scottish governments in       2010.
