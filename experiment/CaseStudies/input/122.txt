     The impact claimed here is based on three key related areas:            Preservation, conservation and presentation of regional cultural         heritage, through cataloguing, digitisation and expansion of access to         materials held by EAFA       Public engagement achieved through a significant increase in East         Anglian residents' interaction with and imagining of the region's (newly         preserved) audio-visual past, via increased access to EAFA materials         through www.eafa.org.uk and a         range of public events       The stimulation of new research and creative projects, bringing         awareness of the collection (and region) to a wider and more diverse         audience          The Process     The impact was facilitated by the AHRC Resource Enhancement grant, which       enabled the unit's research around regional/local media and community to       inform the preservation and accessibility of EAFA's materials, and       encourage the development of new research, engagement and public       initiatives.
Impacts and Benefits     Preservation and Conservation     The grant, designed to `unlock the research and knowledge transfer       potential of its collections' (AHRC Final Report), allowed extensive       cataloguing and preservation work at EAFA, particularly focused on the       Anglia Television materials:            It represented the first rigorous attempt to catalogue EAFA's Anglia         Television collection       As a result, the percentage of Anglia Television productions formally         preserved (and accessible) at EAFA rose from 10% to 50%, and, through         collaborative working with the researchers, archivists had a stronger         understanding of how best to conserve and preserve that material       The project digitised 500 hours of film (1200 films): 230 hours of         that material has been made available on the EAFA website          Audience Expansion     The expansion of EAFA's collection has been communicated and presented       through a series of public events that links the newly accessible material       with unit researchers' existing expertise in media consumption, geography       and regional media:            A two-day academic-industry event, organised by the unit and Anglia         Television - a public forum where unit researchers identified and         explored newly opened EAFA collections.
Held at a specialist film         theatre (Cinema City, Norwich) and open to the general public, this         event was attended by researchers, ex-Anglia personnel, and local         residents.
Public talks from Higson, Jancovich, Mills, and Snelson (and         other unit colleagues, including Su Holmes) highlighted the importance         of EAFA archival material to broader understandings of British regional         television history and local identity       These public talks were complemented by five archive screenings,         including a gala screening of two programmes from Anglia Television's         opening night in 1959.
This research-led event was described as `exceptional and         ground-breaking and has provided ideas for future development of the         Anglia TV resource' (Martin Ayers (Screen East), quoted in AHRC Final         Report, 2008)       The revamped EAFA website, featuring over 500 hours of material, has         had 400,000 visits since 2012, over 263,000 of which have been unique -         a significant means of extending engagement with the material       Over 100 community screenings of EAFA material (2010-11: `Archive         Flicks in the Sticks'; 2012: Norwich HEART Digital Heritage Project),         reaching over 30,000 people across the East Anglia region:                a wonderful reminder of local history here in Bury' (Lynda, Bury)         Congratulations on organising this tour and making films accessible           to all' (Kate A, Bury)         Enjoyable and informative.
Nice way to present archive film' (Liam           R, Cambridge)         Thank you for keeping the Heritage alive.
All that hard work           restoring it paid off' (Anonymous, King's Lynn screening)              EAFA Week (June 2013): a series of archive screenings in Norwich, with         introductions from unit researchers including Snelson's presentation on         the history and heritage of Anglia Television's regional soap opera, Weaver's           Green:                it gave me great insight into the work and restoration that is           undertaken by EAFA'         The staff... who gave the lectures really seemed to care about the           archive, and understood its potential applications for future           generations.'
Collectively, these activities represent a significant expansion in       engagement with EAFA's holdings since 2008: an estimated physical audience       of over 30,000, and an online audience of over 250,000.
This has occurred       across a broad range of social and cultural settings, led by unit research       into the evocative power of local/regional moving images.
Research and Creative Projects     EAFA now has a more significant reach than before, used by academic       researchers (from the Universities of Glasgow, Leicester, Nottingham,       Dundee and Essex), broadcast / production companies (BBC, ITV Anglia, ITV       Leeds, Tiger Aspect, Postcode Films), regional history groups (Norfolk       Museums and Archaeology Service), and charities and public service       organisations such as Norwich HEART, Community Music East and the Norfolk       Records Office (which used the collection for `The Story of Norfolk's       Parish Registers' exhibition).
