     Biak is a vulnerable language with no firmly established orthography.
Dalrymple and Mofu's research in this area is having considerable impact       on preventing the language from extinction and allowing audio and written       material to become available to teach future generations.
As with any       living language, without children speaking and writing the language, Biak       would never survive.
New bilingual dictionaries (Indonesian-Biak) written       using the orthography developed at Oxford will allow these children to       remain truly bilingual.
This not only supports the growth of educational       material for teaching children, but also forms the basis for adult       literacy and development of dictionaries allowing adults to develop the       use of Biak in regular interaction as well as underpin development of       literary material.
Further details of impact are listed below.
Enabling the teaching of Biak to school children through the         development of educational materials:     As the UNESCO publication "First Language First" (2005) observes, the       Indonesian government advocates use of elementary students' first language       in the first three years of elementary school, accompanied by instruction       in Indonesian, for students who do not speak Indonesian as a first       language.
Thus, the Biak dictionary is crucial for use of the language       among school children.
The situation in Papua is difficult, however, since       the population is relatively small (about 3.5 million, about 14% of       Indonesia's population of 237 million), while almost 300 of the 700       languages spoken in Indonesia are spoken in Papua.
This makes the task of       creating local curricular material difficult, and due to these resource       constraints it has been impossible to produce suitable resources for many       languages, despite government policy.
Consequently, resources developed at       Oxford have assisted in the creation of these resources for Biak in       several ways.
First, the Biak orthography used in our database files has       become standard, and is used in Biak-Indonesian dictionaries in schools in       Biak-speaking areas of West Papua.
Second, textbooks and other curricular       materials are being created on the basis of our texts by Mr. Rumbrawer of       UNCEN.
"Now, our children and our children's children can hear and         read our language online and they can also read printed materials that         your team has developed both at UNCEN Jayapura and UNIPA Manokwari... We         are happy to see that many schools in Biak now use materials produced by         Mr Frans Rumbrawer, one member of your team, and his colleagues in         Jayapura.
We hope that the regional government would provide funding so         that Biak text books and dictionaries created by UNCEN and UNIPA would         be produced for all schools in the Biak regency."
[see           &#167;5.1]     Providing best practice in language documentation enabling others to         replicate these methods for Biak and other endangered languages:     Dalrymple and Mofu's database is valuable not only as a record of the       Biak language, but as an example of best practices in language       documentation for other projects to follow.
The beneficiaries include the       international linguistic community as well as other interested bodies in       attempting to document endangered languages or indeed any language, e.g.
Biak has its own page on the website of OLAC, "the Open Language Archives       Community, is an international partnership of institutions and individuals       who are creating a worldwide virtual library of language resources by: (a)       developing consensus on best current practice for the digital archiving of       language resources, and (b) developing a network of interoperating       repositories and services for housing and accessing such resources."
[i]       Links have also been made to their work from the West Papuan blog       Selamatkan Bahasa Leluhur Kita (Save Our Ancestors' Language) [ii],       and from Wilco van den Heuvel's web pages "The Biak Language in its       cultural context" [iii].
There is also a page of Biak       resources on DBpedia, a crowd-sourced community project which extracts       structured information from Wikipedia and makes it available on the Web.
The project was started and is administered by research groups from       Universit&#228;t Leipzig, Freie Universit&#228;t Berlin, and OpenLink Software [iv].
Dalrymple and Mofu provided training in state-of-the-art language       documentation practices to researchers and faculty members at University       of West Papua (UNIPA) and Cenderawasih University, Papua Province (UNCEN),       enabling local communities to pursue documentation efforts for the       hundreds of under-documented and undocumented languages of the area.
The       research has formed the basis of theoretical and applied linguistic work       on Biak at UNCEN and UNIPA, including a trilingual Biak-Indonesian-English       dictionary [v] created using the wordlist from our       project, and illustrated with example sentences from our texts and their       translations into English and Indonesian; work on the dictionary is       complete, and a publisher is being sought.
"I have got copies of the         on-line materials and also Biak - English and Biak - Indonesian         dictionaries which were produced by UNIPA as a result of your project.
The dictionaries are, for me, the first comprehensive dictionaries         because they contain real data and real examples from formal to informal         uses of our language."
[2]     Empowering local communities to save their own endangered languages         through provision of language documentation skills training:     The project's work was conducted in collaboration with Mr. Frans       Rumbrawer (UNCEN) and Mr. Alfons Arsai (UNIPA), with assistance from Ms.       Jinni Makabori and Ms. Denise Mambrasar, also of UNIPA, and the       participation of UNIPA and UNCEN linguistics departments.
The training in       language documentation which Oxford provided at UNIPA bore fruit in our       2010-11 Leverhulme- funded documentation project for Dusner, a severely       endangered Austronesian language of West Papua.
Ms. Mambrasar and Ms.       Makobari were central participants in the Dusner project, and they have       recently secured scholarships for training in academic English       (April-October 2013), in preparation for attending graduate school in       linguistics.
Mr. Rumbrawer is currently pursuing a PhD in Linguistics at a       university in Central Java.
Local community members have been thus       empowered with skills to begin documenting other severely endangered       languages of Papua.
The Biak community has been very supportive and appreciative of the       results in allowing them to preserve their endangered language: "As a         young man from Biak and one of the Biak Customary Council members I felt         so grateful that, finally, you made our dream comes true.
Seeing our         language documented online and is freely available for all Biak speakers         is a real blessing."
[2] The Chief of the Biak       Customary Council writes enthusiastically about Prof Dalrymple and Dr       Mofu's work on Biak, saying "I have seen the impact of the work they         have done that have motivated and strengthened several efforts by local         communities to preserve and develop the language".
[3]       Dr. Mofu gave a presentation of the project database in a general       public meeting of the Biak community in Manokwari, West Papua (19 December       2012); the excitement and enthusiasm for the work that was generated by       this meeting resulted in a follow-up prayer meeting (Manokwari, 3 February       2013), organised by members of the Biak community, to give thanks for the       project and the database it produced.
Each meeting was attended by about       50 Biak speakers from the Manokwari area.
"The fear that our language         will disappear is now replaced with happiness that there is a hope for         its survival..." [1]
