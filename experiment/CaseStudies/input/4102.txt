     Research undertaken by Dr. Shimmield's team to investigate the       environmental impact of the deposition of mine tailings in the deep sea of       Papa New Guinea (PNG) (2006-2010) informed the development, by the       research team, of a set of `Guidelines for the use of DSTP in PNG'2.
These Guidelines were presented publically in 2008, published in 2009 and       in 2012 these guidelines were formally adopted by the government of PNG3,8       (Mineral Resource Authority &amp; Department of Mineral Policy and       Geohazard Management) and established as regulation to control and manage       mining impacts on the marine environment.
The Guidelines outline       international best practice for regulatory frameworks and environmental       considerations including, initial mine development, preliminary site       evaluation, environmental baseline surveys, mining operations, future mine       closure plans and post-mining monitoring.
Dr. Shimmield also developed `Specific Guidelines' for the use of DSTP at       Lihir Gold and Ramu NiCo mines.
Mine Specific Guidelines outline effective       operational and environmental management plans for a specific site, based       on data obtained during the research cruises and detailed study of local       ocean currents and mixing, the chemical signature of the mine tailings       relative to natural sediments, and the structure of deep sea communities       in the area.
Following publication of the research finds (2010), which       detailed the link between elevated arsenic levels in surface waters and       acid mine drainage at Lihir Gold Mine, Lihir Gold Ltd. changed the       management of spoil heaps at the mine to prevent runoff of acid mine       drainage reaching the marine environment9.
The research resulted in the development of regulatory and mine specific       guidelines to regulate the impact of mining on the marine environment and       has lowered the risk associated with mining operations in PNG,       contributing to an increase in PNG's economic performance through mineral       production and exports, specifically the export of copper and gold, from 3       billion Kina (&#163;0.94 billion) in 2001 to 8 billion Kina in 2010 (&#163;2.5       billion)8.
Export trends will continue to increase as in 2011       Ramu NiCo were granted consent for a further $8 billion mine following a       court hearing in which Dr. Shimmield was an expert witness8.
Dr. Shimmield outlined in court the research leading to the development of       Guidelines which will enable effective environmental management of mine       tailings, leading to the court finding in favour of Ramu NiCo8.
Additional Impacts             Change to Political Mind-set: The research on the impacts of         DSTP on the marine environment, and the development of `Guidelines for         the use of DSTP in PNG' created a fundamental shift in the government         perception of the importance of understanding environmental impact.
At         the 2011 Annual PNG Mining Conference, the Acting Managing Director of         the Mineral Resource Authority of the PNG Government, stated "when a           licence to mine was granted thoughts were on how to get the maximum           amount of mineral out of the ground as quickly as possible now the           first thing that is thought of is what will the environmental impact           be of getting the minerals out of the ground, this is a huge cultural           change on how we view mining in PNG and its effects on our environment"8.
Improved Public Understanding: The research team led a series         of awareness campaigns with local villagers throughout the research         project.
These campaigns improved dialogue between the PNG public and         the government by providing an independent (research team) body for the         public to engage with and voice concerns.
As a result villagers went on         to attend the International Conference on DSTP Practices and         Environmental Monitoring4, organised by the research team in         PNG (detailed below).
Research was widely publicised in the media6,7         to raise awareness and to facilitate better public understanding of DSTP         practices and environmental impacts.
Stakeholder Engagement: An integral part of the research         project, was provision of an International Conference on DSTP Practices         and Environmental Monitoring.
This conference took place on 4th - 7th         November 2008 in the Madang Resort, Papua New Guinea4.
The         conference presented and discussed all aspects of the work with over 250         delegates, including PNG landowners &amp; villagers, government,         lawyers, international scientists, NGO's and mining companies.
This         conference provided a platform to present results of the research and         draft guidelines.
Guidelines were discussed with all stakeholders at the         conference.
From this discussion and stakeholder input, the guidelines         were finalised and published in 2009.
Implementation in other regions: The International Marine         Organisation (IMO) received a set of Guidelines which were presented as         an information paper to the Scientific Group meeting of the London         Convention/London Protocol in 2011 (London Convention Scientific Group         2011)5.
The European Committee for Standardisation are using         the basis of the guidelines to develop Sub-Sea Tailings Deposition         Evaluation Guideline for Europe.
