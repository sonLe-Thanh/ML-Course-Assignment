     The impact of this research can be measured in two contexts: the first is       a lecture given at several Sixth Form Conferences run by the English       subject area at Newman University; the second is a guest lecture given       each year to PGCE Secondary English students at Newman University.
Both       these lectures are delivered by Cousins.
The Sixth Form Conference lecture has been developed from research       findings and draws in particular on the work done for the article in The         Journal of Commonwealth Literature.
The theme of the conference was       `The Gothic' as this is one of the topic areas in the AQA A-level       literature specification.
The lecture took `vampires' as its theme as the       article in The Journal of Commonwealth Literature was based around       a contemporary novel featuring a vampire and it drew on theories of       `reverse colonisation' as developed by Daniel Arata in relation to Dracula.
Part of the lecture, explored the rise of the Gothic in relation to       colonisation and discussed how the same notions of the `foreign'       outsider/invader informed much discourse around immigration in       contemporary England.
The lecture was delivered at four Sixth Form Conferences: 2 July 2010, 11       March 2011, 15 November 2011, 20 November 2012.
Records of attendance are       available from March 2011:            11 March 2011 - 175 pupils from 14 schools in the West Midlands;       15 November 2011 - 139 pupils from 7 schools in the West Midlands;       20 November 2012 - 191 pupils from 14 schools in the West Midland and         1 school in East Midlands.
As some schools have attended more than once with different groups of         students (sometimes accompanied by different teachers), this totals: 31         schools and 30 teachers; the total number of pupils is 505.
To assess impact, teachers were emailed in February 2013 to ask them: how       it changed aspects of their teaching of this topic; how it helped them to       rethink some of the concepts around `gothic' and `literature'; any other       ways it helped them to develop the topic with students.
Four teachers       responded: their comments included:            `a useful resource'; `reinforced and introduced what they were         covering'; `Look at Vampires was good &amp;mdah; gave a different         perspective &#8212; it was good to look at it from the point of popular         culture and changes in perspective over time'; `Students had also         commented that they had found it useful' (Rachel Danks, Head of English,         Rugby High School 06/03/2013).
`We loved the conference.
Good venue, the right length, engaging         presentations.
The students found it of use in getting them to think         about wider implications for their Gothic coursework, particularly the         Y13s who were studying it last Term and who this Term will have to         submit their 3000 word coursework (cf OCR Literature, Unit F664) I'll         have more idea on the value of that impact after I've read their         studies.
Meanwhile for the Y12s it was an excellent taster of what is to         come when they study Gothic and a great insight into HE experience'         (James Phillips, Baxter College 13/02/2013).
`We are teaching the topic far more broadly, including 'modern gothic'         to help students relate to the ideas/themes/symbolism of more         traditional gothic'; `Our students were fascinated that there is more to         'literature' than just the canon, so it did open their eyes to thinking         a little more about what is around them!
I think .the refreshing         approach made symbolism and motifs of the gothic more accessible in         older texts for our students' (Michelle Prince, Leek High School         10/02/2013).
The research also underpins a guest lecture delivered to students on the       Secondary English PGCE at Newman University.
This lecture has been       delivered annually since 2009.
The lecture discusses how students might       deliver the part of the curriculum to do with teaching `texts from       different cultures and traditions'.
Considering how the notion of       different cultures might operate in different secondary school class       rooms, the session asks students how they might counter normative ideas       about different cultures through teaching literature, and hence the       labelling of certain texts and authors as outsiders.
It discusses how       students can counter negative stereotypes in schools regarding       `difference' in racial/cultural terms.
These students go on to take work       in schools across the Midlands and further afield.
The partnership office       &#8212; who administers the programme &#8212; have only been keeping record of       students' destination in the last two years:            2010 entry cohort (15 in total) one was employed in Manchester, the         rest in the Midlands;       2011 entry cohort (20 students) two were employed outside of the         Midlands in Cambridge and Bradford.
To assess the impact of these lectures, the current 2012 entry cohort       were surveyed using a short answer questionnaire.
These asked: what new       understandings or ideas did you take from the session; how did this/would       this change your practices in teaching texts from different cultures and       traditions; any other comments?
There were 15 responses.
In response to question one, had allowed the students to think more         about the `perceptions people have with regards to culture and         traditions [...] young people in particular'; and it allowed them to         appreciate the `struggles and challenges that we, as practitioners, will         face when teaching texts from other cultures'.
They showed an         appreciation, as people who will influence a younger generation, that         teaching this aspect of the National Curriculum for English with the         ideas discussed in the lecture, `tackles racism in today's society' and         that it gave pupils a `gateway to explore the world via literature'.
In response to the second question, students felt that the most         important difference in their practice, would be to include context         about the texts: for example, `giving more background information'; `use         images and resources to enable students [pupils] to build an idea of the         themes and issues'; `ensuring that cultures and traditions are explored         in detail beforehand'.
The session had also given the students         confidence to `teach these texts with more awareness of the class [the         different cultural backgrounds in the group]' and to be `culturally         sensitive'.
One student appreciated the message that they `could         approach the topic whilst being sensitive to other's views and cultures'         whilst another felt it had helped in exploring ways of `addressing         different cultures in a positive manner'.
It also encouraged them to         `relate [texts] to current issues'.
In the third response, students indicated that beyond being an         enjoyable and interesting session, it was also `inspirational' and `needed'.
It had enthused some of the students to incorporate `a variety of texts         from other cultures into [their] classroom' and to make links with other         parts of the curriculum such as PHSE.
