     Since 2008, Bekou's research has significantly strengthened the capacity       of International Criminal Justice Institutions (the ICC) and States       (investigators, prosecutors, judges, defence lawyers, legislation       drafters, ministries) dealing with the most serious international crimes.
The distinctive significance of the research is that it tackles the key       challenges by:     1) providing global access to legal information;     2) facilitating the transfer of legal knowledge, expertise and skills       through appropriate analytical and methodological frameworks, and     3) enhancing capacity in post-conflict States.
First, the capacity of national and international criminal justice       institutions is significantly empowered through free, universal access to       legal information.
Bekou's electronic knowledge platform (www.legal-tools.org),       offers an expansive library of legal documents and a range of research and       reference tools.
42,000 users from over 150 countries access the 67,000       documents currently on the database each month [B].
A letter sent       to all ICC State parties by the ICC Prosecutor (2011) recognises that the       Legal Tools "has become the leading resource for legal information on core       international crimes"[C].
Given that such legal information is not       normally available free of charge, under-resourced jurisdictions are       usually precluded from accessing it, thereby significantly lacking in       capacity.
The fact that the Legal Tools tackles this key challenge has       been recognised by numerous States.
In its official address to the ICC       Assembly of States Parties (ASP), Finland (2012) noted that the Legal       Tools "provid[e] equal access to legal sources, which lies at the heart of       the complementarity challenge"[G].
Austria (2008, 2009), Denmark       (2012), Finland (2009, 2011, 2012), the Netherlands (2011), Norway (2011,       2012) and Romania (2012), acknowledge the Legal Tools' value and       "significant contribution" to building national capacity through extensive       references in their official statements at the United Nations and the ASPs       [F,G].
Finally, in the 2012 Mbarushimana decision,       (ICC-01/04-01/10-OA-4, fn.79, 84, 86) the ICC Appeals Chamber started       using the Legal Tools methodology in all its citations [A].
In its       official statement in the 2012 ASP, Norway (commenting on this       development) stated that "this attests to the reliability of this database       and makes the sources cited immediately available to all readers who have       access to the internet"[G].
Besides this universal reach, the       analytical frameworks developed alongside the raw data [6],[C,F,G]       facilitate increased compliance with the ICC regime.
Romania (2012) [G]       observed that `it leads towards an effective universality of the Rome       Statute'.
The significance of NILD, the Nottingham-developed legal tool       for drafting national legislation (used also by Samoa for the drafting of       its legislation) has been recognised by the ASP Cooperation Working Group.
In its 2012 report (paras.
9,10,13), the Group formally requested its       future expansion [2],[D].
Since 2009, the 122 State Parties to the       ICC, in Resolutions adopted by consensus at the end of each ASP session       (2009, para.36; 2010, para.48; 2011, para.63; 2012, para.10), have       repeatedly highlighted the value of the Legal Tools, recognising their       "significant contribution [...] to the promotion of international criminal       law and justice and thus to combating impunity" [3],[H].
Second, the methodology developed by Bekou has changed the way in which       serious international crimes cases are organised, presented and disclosed       before the ICC [1,4,5].
The ICC adopted this methodology when it       held in Bemba: "Each piece of evidence must be analysed -page by       page or, where required, paragraph by paragraph- by relating each piece of       information contained in that page or paragraph with one or more of the       constituent elements or one or more of the crimes with which the person is       charged, including the contextual elements of those crimes, as well as the       constituent elements of the mode of participation in the offence with       which person is charged" [1,4,5],[A].
Since 2008, nine ICC       decisions have adopted this approach (in the Bemba, Katanga,       Muthaura and Ruto cases), which has been found to enhance:       (i) the efficiency of the criminal justice process and (ii) protection of       the rights of the accused [A,E].
The ICC President       acknowledged in 2009 that this legal tool `mak[es] the review of evidence       more efficient and enable[es] the judges to organise the presentation of       evidence in an expeditious manner' [E].
Third, in 2011-3 the research provided resources that led to improvements       in sex crimes prosecutions in the DRC and an increased observance of fair       trial standards in Sierra Leone.
In DRC, the Minister of Justice (MoJ)       adopted the Nottingham developed `DOCF', [6a],[J] and piloted it       in two regions.
In 2012, the MoJ decided to expand its use to a third       region with DOCF gaining first place in 2013 regarding the price/quality       correlation as a coordination tool.
More than 350 cases have been mapped       as a result and for the first time the MoJ has an accurate overview of (a)       the number of open case files involving sex crimes; (b) the stage of the       criminal process; (c) the approximate number of suspects; and (d) the       alleged criminal incidents.
The National Coordinator for Sexual Violence       confirms that since November 2011, DOCF has enabled them to determine (i)       the anticipated number of pre-trial, trial and appellate proceedings; (ii)       the distribution of case files between different courts and geographical       regions; (iii) the extent to which the current case-load will address       incidents during the armed conflict; (iv) which procedural reforms should       be considered to increase national capacity; and (v) to identify which, if       any, alternative measures are required.

In Sierra Leone, the Best Practice Guide (BPG) [6b] was adopted       by the Special Court for Sierra Leone as a completion strategy initiative.
In a speech endorsing the BPG, the President of the Special Court stressed       that `its usefulness[...] can never be overstated' and that it infuses       `life[..] in [the Sierra Leonean] out-dated criminal statutes' [Ia].
As evidenced by the Project report endorsed by the Foreign and       Commonwealth Office [Ib], the BPG has also been endorsed by the       Ministry of Justice, the Chief Justice, the Director of Public       Prosecutions and through a Knowledge Transfer Exercise, reached 197 law       and policy stakeholders.
The BPG was most readily absorbed by all 17 High       Court Judges who, since February 2012, use it particularly regarding       delays and disclosure.
It has also been incorporated in the training       syllabi of the Police Prosecution Service, the Law Society and Bar       Association, and adopted by the Pilot National Legal Aid Scheme for use by       paralegals and lawyers, significantly increasing fair trial compliance [Ib].
