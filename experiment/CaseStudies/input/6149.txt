     The impact of Professor Taylor's research over the period 1 January 2008       and 31 July 2013 can be evidenced in three principal ways.
Editors and publishers have proved enthusiastic to disseminate Professor       Taylor's books to wider and sometimes remote language cultures and       readers.
This can be exemplified in the case of the outcomes cited above.
Art of Today, 1995, was quickly published in an American edition as       Avant-Garde and After, Harry N. Abrams, New York 1995; in a German       edition as Kunst Heute, DuMont, Cologne 1995; in a Spanish edition       as Arte Hoy, Ediciones Akal, Madrid 2000, and in a Korean edition,       Yekong Publishing, Seoul 2002.
That book, with sales of over 15000 between       1995 and 2002 and widely appreciated as a balanced yet sophisticated text       on the situation of contemporary art, was the basis of a further       commission for an updated and expanded account of its subject, published       as Art Today, Lawrence King Publishing, London 2005, which was       also, with minor changes, widely distributed to the American market as Contemporary         Art: Art Since the 1970s, Prentice Hall, New York 2005, with sales       figures of over 6500 between 2005 and 2013.
Translations of Art Today       into Russian and Chinese were subsequently published in 2006 and 2008       respectively and are listed in section 3 above.
Sales figures for the       latter are unknown.
Other prominent examples include the publication of Collage:         The Making of Modern Art, by Thames and Hudson, London 2004,       translated for the French edition as Collage: l'invention des         avant-gardes, Editions Hazan, Paris 2005.
Articles or catalogue       essays by Professor Taylor (not listed above) have been published in       translation in Spanish, Polish, Italian, Russian, Turkish, and French       during the assessment period.
Through these many foreign language       translations Professor Taylor's work has achieved a significant       enhancement of human understanding, sensitivity and imagination in the       cultural field across many communities and cultures.
During the period under review, many of Professor Taylor's publications       have appeared not only within academia, but as catalogues for public       exhibitions.
Examples include Elements of Abstraction: Space, Line and         Interval in Modern British Art in 2005, based on and staged in       Southampton City Art Gallery with its internationally significant holdings       of modern and contemporary British art (cited above); the leading       catalogue essay for Leonid Lamm: from Virtuality to Utopia, at the       State Russian Museum, St Petersburg in 2009 (editions in Russian and       English); and the leading catalogue essay for Robert Motherwell: The         Early Collages at the Solomon R.Guggenheim Museum, New York, in 2013       (also cited above).
Professor Taylor has been invited to write catalogue       essays for public one-man or group exhibitions throughout the period,       including (pre 1 January 2008) for John Goto (Museum of Modern, Oxford       1994), Joseph Cornell and contemporary American Artists (Pavel Zubok       Gallery, New York 2005), Gerald Giamportone (John Hansard Gallery,       University of Southampton 2006); and (post 1 January 2008) for David Ferry       (Galerie de Montaubon, France 2009), George Dannatt (Lemon Street Gallery,       Truro 2010), Ian Dawson, Nick Mead, Katy Pratt (RIBA Gallery Liverpool       2010), Clyde Hopkins (Chelsea Space, London 2011), Stephen Brigdale       (Bargate Gallery, Southampton 2012).
He has lectured widely to public       audiences at prominent galleries or museums during the period including       Tate Modern, London (2010, 2011), Muzeum Stzuki, Lodz, Poland (2011), and       the Museum of Modern Art, Istanbul (2012).
The impact of Professor Taylor's research can also be evidenced in       several interventions in, or contributions to, the policy agenda for the       visual arts on the national and international stage.
He has served as a suppl&#233;ant       of the Commit&#233; International d'Histoire d'Art between 2008 and 2013, and       on the International Advisory Committee of the Oxford Art Journal       from 2010 to the present.
In 2011 he was commissioned by Hampshire Country       Council to research and prepare a refereed report Agenda for         Excellence: The Research Potential of Southampton City Art Gallery         Collection for inclusion in the Gallery's important policy framework       review and funding programme.
