     Between 2009 and 2011, Professor Howell was contracted by the Australian       Agency for International Development (AusAID) to serve as lead researcher       on a fundamental review of AusAID's approach to civil society in its aid       programme to developing countries.
The review was commissioned by the       Office of Development Effectiveness (ODE), an independent unit within       AusAID, with the purpose of highlighting the importance of civil society       to senior management, feeding evidence into AusAID's process for       developing a framework for civil society engagement and, ultimately,       improving AusAID's impact in terms of poverty reduction on the ground.
The       underpinning research was pivotal in bringing Professor Howell to the       attention of AusAID, in defining the substantive approach used in the       review, and in generating the findings and recommendations [A,E].
The findings of the review were presented in a report titled `Working       Beyond Government: Evaluation of AusAID's Engagement with Civil Society in       Developing Countries' (Howell and Hall, 2012) [B] and related reports       focused on fieldwork in Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines       [C,D].
The main report made seven key recommendations grounded firmly in       the underpinning research.
These included:            develop a civil society framework that recognizes civil society in         developing countries as integral to the development process       incorporate analysis of civil society in country situation analyses         and integrate country- specific civil society strategies in country aid         strategies       invest in civil society advisors in headquarters and major country         programs, and activate networks for sharing lessons related to engaging         with civil society       develop a rationale for choosing aid program intermediaries not just         on a results basis but also for their ability to contribute to         developing a sustainable local civil society       include civil society in policy dialogue and implementation when         designing sector wide approaches with partner governments       support initiatives to strengthen the enabling environment for civil         society as part of strengthening civil society where appropriate          AusAID management agreed to take forward all seven of the report's       recommendations [E,F].
According to Russell Miles, AusAID's Director of       NGO Policy, in his 2012 presentation at the Crawford School of Public       Policy [G], the response to the evaluation was not just the normal       management response but instead came directly from the AusAID Executive.
He emphasised that the Executive took the evaluation very seriously and       that it had focused their attention on the issue of civil society in a new       way.
The Australian Council for International Development (ACFID), the       peak organisation for development NGOs, also indicated strong support for       the report and spoke in public forums about their intention to use it to       lobby AusAID for an increased focus on civil society engagement.
Subsequently, as a direct result of the report, AusAID issued a new       policy statement of Effective Governance and developed a new Civil Society       Engagement Framework in consultation with ACFID [F].
This framework,       formally released in 2012, "recognises the emergence of an informed and       engaged civil society as an important development outcome in its own       right...and provides the overarching direction by which all seven of the       recommendations are implemented" [H].
In publishing the Framework, AusAID       described the new approach as "...a significant shift in the Australian       government's engagement with civil society organisations with a sharper       focus on: effectiveness, results, sustainability, risk reduction,       efficiency and value for money, diversity and innovation."
[I]     Implementation of the report's recommendations has produced a number of       significant actions and impacts [F,J], including:     a) an increase in money going to NGOs in the context of AusAID's changing       approach to civil society, from $500 million in 2011-2012 to $700-800       million by 2015-16 (a 40-60% increase),     b) a doubling of funding to the Australian NGO Cooperation Project, from       $ 69 million in 2010- 2011 to $150 million by 2014-15,     c) establishment of the Civil Society Network, a cross-agency working       group,     d) establishment of the Civil Society Portal, a web portal for NGOs and       other civil society organisations that serves as a central hub for       information on accreditation, funding and other issues relevant to working       with AusAID     e) all country programmes conducting civil society analyses, and     f) governance and social development advisors taking responsibility for       engaging with civil society through dialogue, networking, projects and       strategic analysis.
Since 2012 the Civil Society Engagement Framework has been in the process       of being progressively rolled out in all 37 developing countries in which       AusAID works [I].
Jo Hall, ODE Director, provides examples of the       different ways in which this is being done from three country programmes       [H]:            The Philippines programme has replaced its longstanding community         assistance programme involving small grants with a new programme called         `Coalitions for Change', a much more strategic approach for working with         civil society organisations as recommended by the Framework       In line with the new requirement to analyse `the role of civil society         in both policy development and service delivery' as part of country         situation analysis, the Indonesia programme has completed an NGO sector         review designed to maximize NGO involvement in poverty reduction,         identifying specific ways to engage directly with NGOs and to improve         the policy and funding environment in which they operate       The Papua New Guinea programme has worked with a range of civil         society organisations to help them map out their capacity-building needs         and to develop a concrete strategy for addressing those needs.
Full implementation of the Civil Society Engagement Framework is expected       to be completed by 31 December 2013, following alignment with agency-wide       reforms and close consultations with ACFID and NGO members on key projects       [J].
Despite this formal end-date, the ODE Director predicts that the       report's "concrete and positive impact on the way that AusAID works with       civil society through its aid program...is likely to continue to have       influence" into the future [H].
Wider Implications: LSE work is contributing to better aid       delivery and monitoring mechanisms by an increasingly important donor       nation.
Ceteris paribus, stronger civil societies should enable       more effective governance in aid-recipient countries.
