     The Penguin Book of Irish Poetry sold over 12,000 copies in its       first three months (30 September to 31 December 2010), a considerably       greater number than the publishers expected of such a large (1120 pp.)
and       expensive (&#163;40) hardback.
(Penguin initially envisaged a print-run of       5000.)
The anthology featured in the Irish Top Ten Non-Fiction       best-selling lists in October 2010.
Sales of the hardback then slowed       before the release of a paperback edition in March 2012, which has sold a       further 1600 copies.
The book was reviewed in the Daily Mail, Dublin Review of Books,         Essays in Criticism, Financial Times, Independent, Irish Catholic, Irish         Examiner, Irish Times, PN Review, Prairie Schooner, the Tablet and Times         Literary Supplement.
It was the subject of two articles in the Irish         Times and one in the Guardian.
The volume was a Book of the       Year in the Independent, Scotland on Sunday, the Tablet       and the Times Literary Supplement.
The anthology was launched by Seamus Heaney (Nobel laureate) and Michael       Longley (winner of the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry) at an event attended       by 300 people at the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin.
Highlights of the       launch were broadcast on RTE Radio's Morning Ireland, main daily       news and current affairs programme in the Irish Republic.
Crotty was       interviewed on Radio 3's Night Waves, RTE's Arena and BBC       Radio Ulster's Arts Extra, pre-eminent radio arts programmes       respectively in Great Britain, the Republic of Ireland and Northern       Ireland.
He also gave interviews on one national and two local independent       radio stations in Dublin.
Publication of the paperback was marked by a       half-hour discussion between critic Niall MacMonagle and host Pat Kenny on       the 9 April 2012 (Easter Monday) edition of RTE Radio 1's Today with         Pat Kenny.
The publicity surrounding the launch excited public debate about cultural       identities, as when the SDLP MLA Conall McDevitt tweeted his surprise at       the book's high estimate of the Ulster Scots poetry of James Orr       (1770-1816).
Such inclusivity towards multilingualism and Presbyterian       heritage contributed to ongoing processes of memorialisation and       reconciliation in Northern Ireland and to the intermittent controversy       about the authenticity of Ulster Scots language and culture.
Roy Foster in the Financial Times described the book as `much       more than an anthology .
.
.
an alternative history of Ireland'.
Clair       Wills in the Irish Times declared the editorial selection       `impossible not to admire', while Patricia Craig in the Independent       wrote that `this .
.
.
magnificent anthology .
.
.
achieves what might       seem nearly impossible, a balanced view of Irish poetry from the earliest       times to the present'.
Timothy Webb in Prairie Schooner praised       the `compulsive.
.
.
exuberance and energy' of the book's editorial       vision.
Reviews drew attention to the Introduction, described as `sterling' by       Craig and as `incisive and thoughtful' by Edward Larrissy (in Essays         in Criticism), and said by Foster to mark Crotty's emergence `as a       formidably accomplished .
.
.
critic'.
Michael Glover in the Tablet       called it `tremendously informative.
.
.
the best and fullest account I       have ever read of the complicated history of poetry in Ireland: of its       languages, the battle between Gaelic and English, the flight of the Bards       &#8212; all .
.
.
summarised masterfully and engrossingly'.
The structure of the book was another focus of attention.
Craig said the       volume was `superbly organised', while Barra &#211; Seaghdha in the Dublin         Review of Books praised the `scale' and `architecture' of `a fully       realised, multi-storey edifice'.
The editor's translations, too, elicited       approbation, being described as `wonderful' by Wills, and the work of a       `formidably accomplished translator as well as critic' by Foster.
Gerard       Mangan in the Times Literary Supplement observed that Crotty `has       risen to a very complex challenge in the sheer variety of voices he has       recreated convincingly.'
A celebration of the book, featuring readings by the poet-translators       Ciaran Carson, Bernard O'Donoghue and Kit Fryatt, was held on 23 May 2011       as part of Aberdeen's annual WORD festival.
`Conversations with an Irish       Penguin', a public seminar on the recreation of early medieval Irish       literature in the first section, was conducted by David Dumville, the       University of Aberdeen's Professor of History, Paleography and Celtic, at       the National University of Ireland Galway on 14 April 2012 and at Harvard       University on 22 September 2012.
John Wyse Jackson claimed in the Irish Catholic that it would       take a lifetime to absorb the riches of the anthology.
The main impact of       the work, a matter of a wide general readership's enhanced understanding       of the literary, cultural and historical past of Ireland, will similarly       be a long term affair.
