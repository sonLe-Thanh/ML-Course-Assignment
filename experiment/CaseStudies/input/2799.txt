     Owen's and King's work on developing a conflict specific framework for       analysing the potential of religious peacebuilding within a given context       has led to increased engagement between themselves and policy makers both       in Nepal and in the UK.
In 2012/13 the WCRRP was invited on three       different occasions to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to talk to       staff and senior officers about religious peacebuilding, both in Nepal and       several other contexts including Syria.
Their work in this area has also       been presented to Lord Alderdice at the House of Lords in May 2013 and as       a result he has offered to convene a meeting of Lords interested in this       area, with a view to establishing a working committee with representation       from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department for International       Development, as well as academic institutions working in this area.
Whilst       difficult to quantify precisely, their research and the growing reputation       of WCRRP has increased the awareness and willingness of civil servants and       policy makers to more seriously consider the necessity and importance of       engaging religious leaders, groups and organisations in situations of       conflict.
The impact of their research within the Nepalese context is much clearer       and more tangible.
During the first two periods of fieldwork Owen and King       initiated dialogue with a wide range of religious and non-religious actors       involved in the peacebuilding process to survey the current state of       religious peacebuilding in Nepal and collect baseline data for the       project.
This interactive assessment initiated a process of knowledge       exchange, and drawing on insight from previous research; in-depth       knowledge of the relevant religious traditions; and an enhanced       understanding of the Nepal context, Owen and King were able to facilitate       change for a variety of stakeholders.
For example, religious stakeholders       consistently reported a clearer understanding of the potential of       religious actors within the peace and development processes, and the type       and nature of engagements necessary to their being seen as legitimate       actors by other stakeholders.
`Secular' organisations (such as Saferworld,       UNODA) reported a greater understanding of the potential roles of       religious groups and communities, and increased confidence in how to       approach them.
The research data collected during the first two periods of field work       was subsequently used to devise a participative and facilitative workshop       which was delivered in June 2013 to several inter-faith organisations       based in the Terai region, where inter-religious conflict has       traditionally been a problem.
Workshops particularly in Neplagunj and       Biratnagr were very well-received, with religious actors reporting a range       of benefits including:            Increased understanding of the roles of religious actors in         peacebuilding;       A greater appreciation of the problems and potentials of religion in         the Nepalese context;       Increased advocacy skills particularly in relation to engaging         national and state actors;       Better insight into the barriers to participation in peacebuilding for         religious actors at national and international level.
In addition to the workshops, a national level symposium and consultation       was held in Kathmandu on 17th and 18th June 2013 in       association with Religions for Peace Nepal and the Department of Conflict,       Peace and Development Studies, Tribhuvan University.
The consultation was       the direct result of the relationship building process carried out by King       and Owen, and brought together religious actors, faith-based       organisations, `secular' peace practitioners, INGOs/NGOs, as well as       policy makers and government representatives including the Minister for       Peace and Reconstruction.
King's and Owen's research informed the       structure and content of the symposium, and they facilitated much of the       dialogue process.
As a result of the two day discussion a wide range of stakeholders agreed       and signed up to the `Kathmandu Declaration' an action plan identifying       specific areas of religious peacebuilding on which religious and       non-religious organisations and actors would collaborate       (http://www.winchester.ac.uk/academicdepartments/theology/Research/Documents/Kathmandu%20Declaration%20final.pdf).
Additional       impacts include:            The initiation of network of stakeholders working in peacebuilding;       The opportunity for grassroots peacebuilders (from Biratnagar,         Neplagunj, and Muslim communities) to address for the first time a high         level national audience and inform them of their problems;       A shift in recognition of the importance and potential of religious         actors at government level;       A report summarising the last three years research has been compiled         and on invitation submitted to the Minister of Peace and Reconstruction         and we are awaiting his response; particularly in relation to assisting         in the establishment of a national level `Commission on Religious         Affairs' which would act as an advisory body to the government to act as         an early warning system for identifying potential problems within and         between religious groups         (http://www.winchester.ac.uk/academicdepartments/theology/Research/Documents/Religion%20and%20Peacebuilding%20in%20Nepal%20Report.pdf).
