     The impact detailed here is corroborated in a letter from M. Vance Grant,       Managing Director of PropexFabrics GmbH [A].
In particular: "The Curv&#174;       self reinforced PP composite which is a direct result of the hot         compaction technology as applied to polypropylene developed at the         University of Leeds has become a very profitable business venture for         PROPEX FABRICS" [A].
Pathway to Impact       The impact started with a number of commercial paths developed in       conjunction with the underpinning research.
These paths led directly from       the advances made with the composite polymer materials.
Initially in 1994       it was evident that the hot compaction technology could have a significant       commercial application [1].
A small spin out company VANTAGE POLYMERS was       created under the auspices of Leeds Innovations with Ward as       Managing Director and several full time and part time staff.
This venture       was initially funded by Hoechst Celanese as licensee of the Leeds high       modulus polyethylene fibre technology, and later by the Ford Motor       Company.
The creation of the company enabled further progress on       developmental work and commercialisation by Ward and M Bonner also of the       University of Leeds, with direct support from PROPEX, BTG and other       interested parties.
In 2000, the commercial operations were sufficiently       developed to transfer to BP AMOCO (now PROPEX FABRICS) under a major       licensing deal.
Then in 2002, PROPEX FABRICS set up the first commercial       plant for Curv&#174; self reinforced PP composite at their site in       Gronau Germany [B].
The first impact that led from the licensing deal with PROPEX FABRICS       occurred in 2005.
Samsonite pioneered the use of Curv&#174; to       produce a new range of lightweight, and impact resistant luggage as part       of their premier X'Lite collection [C].
"Samsonite's use of CURV         composite is a revolution in the industry, providing the worldly         traveler with the best in performance," says Quentin Mackay,       Samsonite's Global Creative Director [C].
Impact during the REF period       The impact has expanded massively following the initial success of X'Lite.
In 2009 Samsonite extended the use of Curv&#174; to a higher volume       and more cost effective range of suitcases, the Cosmolite range [D].
The       Cosmolite range continues to be a successful product for Samsonite and has       received very favorable reviews from consumers and experts alike [E].
In       2009-2010 the Cosmolite suitcase was the number 1 seller of the whole       Samsonite range.
It was also the highest selling suitcase in Europe in       2009-2010, with contribution to Samsonite's total net sales increasing       from 0.4% in 2008 to 7.5% in 2010 [F].
Successive generation of Samsonite       suitcases based on the Curv&#174; single polypropylene composite       included Cubelite&#174; (2010) [G] and Firelite&#174; (2012)..
This is both an economic and an environmental impact.
Economically,       Samsonite has experienced a massive growth in sales since the introduction       of the Curv&#174; material.
This distinct and material contribution       for polymer technology can be seen through the 34% increase in sales on       year ending 31st December 2011 [H].
This is a clear indication       of how significant the technology has been to industry on a global level.
Indeed, the 2011 Annual report reports (Financial Highlights on page 4)       that in addition to the 34% increase in net sales there has also been an       increase of 56.6% in adjusted net income and a 47.2% increase in adjusted       EBITDA [H].
The environmental aspect of the impact can be seen from       improved quality of the Samsonite suitcases.
The composite material is       lighter, more durable, and more efficient to produce than materials       previously used by Samsonite.
A second impact, also of economic and environmental significance, that       has come from the licensing deal with PROPEX FABRICS is the introduction       of the Curv&#174; material to the manufacturing of audio technology       in the loudspeaker industry.
Indeed, the loudspeaker consulting group       Menlo Scientific describe how the University of Leeds originally developed       the composite polymer technology before BP Amoco aquired the technology       and created PROPEX FABRICS to commercialise the process [J].
A third important economic impact has been in the market of sporting       goods.
Bauer manufactures elite level hockey skates (the SUPREME and VAPOR       lines, both using Curv&#174;), and had 69% of the market share for       ice skates worn by USA professional National Hockey League players in 2011       [M,N].
Continuing Development and Impact     The reach of the composite polymer impact can be clearly seen from the       multi-partner industrial collaboration project FuturePlas [K].
In 2006       Leeds were part of a successful Technology Strategy Board (TSB) proposal       focused back on PE materials (Future Plas &#8212; Generating the next generation       of single polymer composites, &#163;250,000 2006-2008).
The research undertaken       showed that the incorporation of an interleaved film was even more       important for these highly crystallised materials, which normally have a       very narrow melting range.
Using a film it was shown that sheets with       significantly improved stiffness and strength could be obtained.
Following       this, an EU FP7 research project (hivocomp.eu, &#163;600K, 2010-2014, with       Leeds, PROPEX, SAMSONITE, and 4 EU academic partners) was set up to focus       on achieving radical advances in composite materials for cost effective,       higher-volume production of high performance carbon fibre reinforced       parts.
The project is analysing and developing self-reinforced composites       based on thermoplastic polypropylene and polyacrylamide, hybridised with       carbon fibre, with potential further high impact application in the       automotive, aerospace, and luxury luggage sectors.
In addition another       spin off company was formed RIGICOMP headed by Ward which extends       the hot compaction technology for the manufacture of self reinforced       technology [L].
Summary       To recap, the underpinning research outlined in Section 2 created a range       of high-impact-resistant polymer composites, through cost-effective and       commercially exploitable methods.
Polypropylene was identified as the most       appropriate polymer for which a wide reach of the technology was       applicable.
A wide range of applications has been developed for the       material Curv&#174;, including anti- ballistic body armour, sports       goods (NIKE, BAUER), and lightweight luggage (SAMSONITE).
