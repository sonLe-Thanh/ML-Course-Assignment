     At the end of this section we bullet-point our specific research         contributions; before that we outline their development and in so doing         demonstrate their authenticity.
The Swansea Railway Verification Group [C1],       supported by eight academics, is a direct result of the research       underpinning the impact.
Its various projects are motivated by       interactions with Invensys Rail, a company with a powerful heritage in the       railway industry stretching back 140 years.
Since 1935 Invensys has had       its head office in Chippenham, and it currently employs over 4,000 people       worldwide within the Invensys group of companies which together have over       20,000 employees.
(On 2 May 2013 Invensys Rail was acquired by Siemens but       continues to operate under the name Invensys Rail as part of Siemens' Rail       Automation Business Unit.)
With a growing track record in rail signalling research, the Swansea           Railway Verification Group was awarded an EPSRC Grant entitled       SafeCap [C2] worth &#163;450,000 (full economic costing)       to Swansea University which supports one full-time PDRA and part of the       time of Faron Moller and Dr Markus Roggenbach.
While       administered by EPSRC, this grant is in fact funded by the Rail Safety         and Standards Board (RSSB) and was awarded after an open call and       extensive review process by RSSB with a full interview stage.
The call was       for research ideas that would have the greatest potential for impact       on overcoming capacity constraints on railways; SafeCap was ranked       second of five successful proposals [C3]; and its success       has led to the Group being invited to contribute to the development of an       Academic Research Strategy Document impacting on strategic       decisions in policy making at national level.
According to the Senior VP (Engineering) for Invensys Rail [C4],       "the Swansea Railway Verification Group can be said to have had an       impact on changing attitudes and practices at head office level         within Invensys Rail, a long-established multi-national company."
Evidence of this impact provided by this Senior VP is outlined below.
In 2007 the Senior VP (Engineering) was VP (Technology) at Invensys.
As       he describes in his letter, he invited Moller to Chippenham to consult on       a major project on which the company was working; this multi-million-pound       contract involved developing software for controlling interlockings at 111       stations in the UK, and he sought expert advice from Moller about what       theoretical and formal methods tools were available, or could be       developed, to stream-line this mammoth task.
With this initial consultation, the VP (Technology) embarked on       developing a research-focussed ethos in the company and welcomed Moller's       input on this vision.
The creation of the Swansea Railway Verification         Group, with its many projects supported by Invensys Rail, attests to       this vision.
Apart from the VP (Technology), three further members of       staff at Invensys Rail have been directly involved in this research and       contributed large amounts of time and effort to it: the Director of       Research (a new post created early on in the research programme); and two       Senior Solutions Architects.
According to the VP (Technology), "it is         a direct consequence of the engagement with the         Swansea Railway Verification Group that the new position of           Director of Research was created in the company."
Various other members of the technical staff at the company have also       engaged with the different projects at various times in order to ensure       that the research being carried out can be effectively deployed in       practice.
According to the Director of Research at Invensys [C5], "the       research carried out in Swansea - in particular the verification tools       developed - has directly led to the adoption of           formal verification tools and techniques within the           interlocking design stage.
The company's motivation with         this is to cut down greatly on the time taken to deliver           interlocking systems by reducing the expensive and time-consuming         testing cycle inherent in the process.
With these techniques in place,         many design problems can be identified and rectified at the design stage         before going into the testing phase."
Also according to the Director       of Research, "we have engaged with you on a variety of discussions           exploring various regulatory and commercial necessities, and         explored with you a wide spectrum of formal methods technologies on live         problems emanating from ongoing Invensys Rail contracts."
Specific Research Contributions and their Impacts     Specific research contributions providing impact are as follows:            The adoption of formal verification techniques within the         interlocking design stage at Invensys Rail.
The development of a novel modelling language and approach to         modelling systems with which technical staff within the railway industry         can build models in a way which is natural to their engineering         understanding; they are no longer hindered by the use of traditional         solid state interlocking languages, nor by the unnatural and         incomprehensible nature of the alternatives proposed by the research         community.
The analysis of performance data which examines line and         network capacity constraints, with a view to identifying means for         improving capacity on the UK railway network under the existing         traditional interlocking technology.
The analysis of the strategic merits of adopting ETMS, both         alongside and in place of existing interlocking systems.
Our impact reaches beyond Invensys Rail into national regulatory bodies.
According to a Principle Engineer at Network Rail [C6], "the         impact of the SafeCap project is that it has changed           attitudes at Network Rail by demonstrating the         potential and the benefits of Formal Methods to Railway design.
The         SafeCap results promise to reshape the GRIP design process         for early stage safety and capacity analysis."
(GRIP stands       for Governance for Railway Investment Projects and is the standard       employed at Network Rail for managing and controlling projects; compliance       to the standard is mandatory, so influence on the shape of GRIP         represents substantial impact on Network Rail practices.)
Due to the success of our research efforts, we             contributed to a paper solicited by the Institute of Railway             Signal Engineers (IRSE) entitled "The Future of Train           Control Systems" which was presented and discussed by railway signal           engineers at their meeting in London on 13 February 2013, and later presented             by invitation to the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB)           on 14 May 2013.
[C7]         were invited to join a panel to develop an Academic             Research Strategy Document as a response to the Rail           Transit Strategy 2012, which seeks "a national policy for the           development of the railway over a 30-year planning horizon."
[C8]         have the credibility to lead on the first compilation of             a Body Of Knowledge in Formal Methods in Rail, to           be developed from a Workshop titled FM-RAIL-BOK that we will organise           in September 2013.
The committee overseeing this Workshop includes           various representatives from industry and rail standards boards.
