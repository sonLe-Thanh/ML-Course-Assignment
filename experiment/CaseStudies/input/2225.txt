     The growth in interest in composite pipeline repairs led Shell       International, who were a partner in the "Composites Offshore" programme,       to approach the standards bodies in order to establish international       standards which would ensure the quality of pipeline repairs.
Their       knowledge of the original work led them to approach Gibson and Kotsikos to       support drafting of the standards, based on P3.
This led to the drafting of two entirely new standards, ISO/TS 24817 -       Composite repairs for pipework, published in 2006 and revised in 2011 (S1       in section 5) and more recently ASME PCC-2, Repair of pressure vessels and       piping, published in 2008 and revised in 2011 (S2), with the ASME standard       based on the ISO standard.
These are now mandatory standards for any       organisation undertaking composite pipeline repair.
The introduction of       engineered composite pipeline repairs underpinned by these standards       marked a clear step forward in safety enhancement in the offshore industry       whilst simultaneously minimising disruption and therefore reducing costs.
Their use in off-shore installations is especially widespread because they       are a cold temperature repair solution.
The technology has played an       essential part in maintaining the productivity of ageing offshore plant       around the world and in particular in the North Sea.
4.1 Impact on Standards       Composite pipeline repairs are used by a wide variety of sectors including       aerospace, automotive and the offshore industry mainly because of their       versatility and cold application.
Until the development of the new       international standards based on Newcastle's research in this area, uptake       of composite repairs was limited due to the inconsistent application of       repairs and consequent variation in the failure rates of the repairs.
The standards were developed to cover all aspects of installation       including the training and validation of the repair staff.
These two       standards have enormously improved the consistency of repair works in this       area and given a significant stimulus to their uptake in the offshore       industry.
In the development of the ISO standard (which covers the       material qualification, design, installation and inspection of composite       repairs) several new test methods and analysis routines were developed.
These test methods were specifically concerned with assessing and       quantifying the adhesion characteristics of composite repairs to metallic       pipes.
The Chairman of the ISO committee supports the contribution made by       Newcastle University to the ISO/TS 24817 standard [S3]:     "During the development and writing of the ISO standard the work         performed by Newcastle University formed the basis for the test protocol         and the analysis routine used to convert the qualification test data         into an engineering parameter which is used in the design of the         composite repair.
Without doubt without the supporting work of Newcastle         University the current ISO standard, ISO/TS 24817, would not be such a         robust standard in terms of the engineering rigor of the test and         analysis routines of the measured qualification test data."
4.2 Impact on Pipeline Industry       Several successful companies (or parts of companies) specialising in       composite repair technology have been created offering pipeline       rehabilitation services around the world (e.g.
Prokem Pipeline Products,       IMG Composites, Walker Technical, ENECON and Clock Spring).
The size of       the worldwide market for pipeline repairs is estimated to be &#163;250-350M       p.a., with at least 10% growth expected in the European market next year [S4].
The development of the international standards, underpinned by the       original research at Newcastle, has given the technical confidence to       support the growth of this industry sector.
The work at Newcastle has       played a key role in transforming the working practices of the pipe repair       and maintenance industry.
Comments in an article entitled `Composite pipe repairs gain acceptance'       by the Chief Executive at Belzona, an industrial company specialising in       the repair and maintenance of buildings, structures, machinery and       equipment identified the following as the characteristics which have led       to the wide adoption of composite pipe repairs [S5]:     "Composite repairs have gained greater acceptance among asset owners         and equipment operators because they provide an engineered, durable and         affordable solution and they comply with international engineering         standards."
Concluding his article he goes on to state:     "Composite repairs are indeed the right solution for extending the         lifetime of equipment in an efficient and reliable manner."
The Technical Director of Walker Technical, a UK company involved in       composite technology for the oil and gas, petrochemical, refinery and       power industries supports the increasing use of composite repairs and in       particular in off-shore installations [S3]:     "Composite repairs over the last few years have become a         common repair solution for damaged or corroded pipework in Oil and Gas         installations.
Their use, particularly in off-shore installations, has         become widespread due to the fact that they are a cold repair solution.
Hot repair solutions e.g.
welding are considered a safety risk due to         the presence of both heat and ignition sources."
