     The final report provided recommendations for the successful operation of       street markets across a variety of sites and sectors, including local       authority markets, privately run markets, and farmers' markets.
It argued       that markets were significant in a number of key local and national       government policy arenas: community development and cohesion, health       agendas for better diets and nutrition, economic and social innovation       agendas including offering sites for start up businesses, and       environmental agendas for reductions in packaging and shopping in the       locality by foot as opposed to car journeys to supermarkets at some       distance.
The research led to a number of publications as indicated above.
The research was immediately picked up by the National Association of       British Market Authorities (NABMA), which is the leading organisation for       local authority street markets across the UK.
Watson was asked to give the       keynote lecture at the NABMA annual conference in 2006.
Here she promoted       a new agenda for the role of markets beyond their traditional role as       commercial and retail sites.
Her argument, which became central to NABMA's       public platform, was that markets had other roles to play in terms of       political and policy agendas for urban regeneration, social and community       inclusion and cohesion, healthy eating and nutrition, economic innovation,       and the reduction of environmental impact and city liveability.
The       research was influential in the launch of the Love Your Local Market         Campaign and in providing the impetus for the regeneration of       markets in local areas.
Graham Wilson Chief Executive of NABMA confirmed the significance of the       impact of Watson's research as follows:     Sophie Watson was really the first person to undertake research on the         social impact of markets.
The research was of great significance because         it led to a more detailed consideration of the way markets interact with         their local communities.
Sophie's research was also one of the catalysts         for the Communities and Local Government's Committee Inquiry into Retail         Markets which produced a detailed agenda for the markets industry to         address.
In the period since Sophie's research, we have seen markets linked         with a range of policy objectives including healthy eating, culture,         tourism, public space utilisation, new start opportunities and         regeneration and it is this broader base that has given markets a higher         profile and wider appeal.
The research was enhanced by the provision of         case studies showing what can be achieved and providing good practice         guidance for those who want to find new ideas and initiatives.
In the         last two years my organisation has led the `Love Your Local Market         Campaign' which has focused on new start opportunities but also sought         to build affection and support for local markets and provide evidence of         the connectivity between the market and the well being of the local         community.
Sophie must take credit for giving us the impetus to look at         this wider picture.
Watson's invited lecture at the National Food Markets Conference         2007: From Producer to Consumer further emphasised the social and       public role of markets to market advocates whose focus to date had been on       the more nutritional value of markets.
From 2008-9 Watson was a special adviser to the House of Commons DCLG       Select Committee's Traditional Retail Markets Inquiry.
Her role       was to highlight the hidden social and community benefits of street       markets that had hitherto been unrecognised.
She accompanied the       Commission on two site visits to Leicester and to two London markets       (Annexes 2 and 3 of the final report).
Watson was also a key witness to the Committee.
Her arguments were       central to the final report `Can Market Failure:Traditional Markets         Survive?
', presented to the House of Commons DCLG Committee in 2009       (see pp.
Ev 4-8).
Her evidence and arguments brought a new perspective to       the value of street markets in the UK, which has contributed to their       regeneration in many local areas.
In 2010, Watson was appointed as expert adviser to Regeneris on the       London Development Agency Report on London's street markets.
Her       contribution to this is evidenced in their report London's Street         Markets.
Her research was also drawn upon in Markets 21 A Policy         and Research Review of UK Retail and Wholesale Markets in the 21st       Century conducted by the Retail Markets Alliance in November 2009.
Her work was cited as evidence in a written statement submitted by R.       Janssens to the Draft Newham Core Strategy with respect to Newham's       strategy for Queens Market.
Watson was invited again by NABMA to remind market authorities and       strategists of her arguments at the 2013 Annual Conference.
At this event       many of the speakers and participants spoke of how they had adopted her       recommendations in their strategies for revitalising or rebuilding their       local markets.
There was now a much wider acceptance of the notion that       markets could play a role in revitalising the community and as a social       and public space.
Her speech was reported on the NABMA website following       the conference.
Rob Nixon - markets manager for Stoke on Trent Council       reports:     Despite recent advances in profile emanating from the likes of the         `Portas' study, markets to a greater extent remain hidden in terms of         their role and significance.
With over 47,000 micro businesses, their         staff and associated supply chains, they are surely an important part of         our retail landscape.
However I and many people in the industry believe         they are so much more in terms of place management.
I refer specifically         to the part markets play in social interaction and cohesion.
Despite         their history, countrywide presence and broad reach there remains little         in the way of empirical data or theory surrounding retail markets.
This is the reason why your work `Markets as Sites for Social         Interaction' has and remains a staple document for those working in the         industry....It is one of the few documents that identifies the humanity         of the market environment and in doing so explains why despite the         dramatic change in patterns of consumption they survive and in many         places prosper.
Watson has been invited to a number of different institutions and events       to give lectures on street markets and their implications for public       space, and on the methodologies for researching street markets.
Her       research has had a significant impact on teaching in the City of Vienna       where she was appointed in 2011-12 to a Visiting Professorship in SKUOR &#8212;       The Interdisciplinary Centre for Public Space and Urban Cultures &#8212; a post       funded in part by the City of Vienna.
Her role was to lead student       research on street markets in Vienna and Budapest.
She was invited to present her research on BBC Radio 4's Thinking         Allowed in May 2011 and was also a guest on the programme on 20       March 2013.
Watson's research on street markets is featured on the Charisma Web Site       for Consumer Market Studies.
To summarise, through Watson's different activities and roles cited       above, markets are now recognised by national and local government, within       the market authorities sector, as key sites for sociality, community and       public space.
