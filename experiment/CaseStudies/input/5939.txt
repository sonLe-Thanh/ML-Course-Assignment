     The IB approach was made Government policy and rolled out in England and       Wales as `personal       budgets' (PB).
The detailed IBSEN findings and the linked carers study       primarily shaped and       contributed to the future implementation of the PB policy at local and       national levels in England as       the findings revealed which systems were most effective for implementing       IBs and what to look out       for as problems with changes in funding streams.
There has also been       considerable international       interest from countries and regions interested in adopting the IB       approach.
The official target is for       70% of social care users to have a personal budget.
1.3 million people       received services in 2012-13       (Health and Social Care Information Centre).
The following is a selection of the major impacts, and is indicative of       the breadth and depth of the       impact of the research on policy and practice:            DH published a detailed 37 page report specifically addressing IBSEN's         findings.
This stated:         `The Department of Health welcomes the independent evaluation reports         produced by         [IBSEN].....The IBSEN research greatly improves our understanding of         these issues... it will         strongly inform [personal budget] implementation....
In moving forward,         strong attention will be         paid to those issues where the risks highlighted by IBSEN are most         significant....The lessons         learned from the separate research into carer's experiences of IBs ...         are also important.'
(passim, DH, 2008)1.
The Appendix included details of         the actions taken by DH in response to         26 elements of the recommendations from IBSEN.
These included: Ministers         looking at the         issues around incorporation of income streams when considering further         development of         individual budgets and feeding this into public consultation via the         welfare reform green paper         No One Written Off.
Feeding insights from the evaluation into the         planning for personal health         budget pilots.
Collating learning and best practice from IBSEN when         creating the         Personalisation Toolkit for councils.
Feeding into Departmental         reviews on charging and also a         CSCI review of Fair Access to Care Services.
IBSEN findings on the poorer experiences of older people were         particularly problematic.
The         Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE), on behalf of DH,         commissioned further research         from SPRU to identify good practice in delivering PBs to older people         and people with mental         health problems (Newbronner et al., 2011)2; this further         study is also widely cited in policy and         practice guidance.
IBSEN also prompted the English Association of         Directors of Adult Social         Services (ADASS) to commission a further review of evidence and practice         in delivering PBs         for older people (Routledge and Carr 2013)3.
The IBSEN research was used to inform guidance on how best to         implement IBs in relation to         improving outcomes for carers.
DH (2010)4        IBSEN shaped the DH approach to the design, piloting and evaluation of         NHS personal health         budgets (PHBs)5 between 2009-12: the DH commentary on the         IBSEN findings stated `the         issues and complexities raised have influenced the decision to pilot         Personal Health Budgets'1.
SPRU also played a key role in the PHB evaluation.
IBSEN evidence on the pilot projects' difficulties in integrating         funding streams shaped the         design of the Department for Work and Pension's (DWP) Right to Control `trailblazer'         pilot         projects introduced by the Welfare Reform Act 2009.
Before commissioning         its evaluation of         the `trailblazers' DWP commissioned a feasibility study to learn         from the experiences of the         IBSEN evaluation.
The report of the evaluation of Right to Control8         says "The Right to Control         pilot .... builds on the Individual Budgets pilot ....
The Right to         Control [pilot] also addresses         the legal and accountability barriers to integrated funding streams         identified in the evaluation of         the Individual Budgets pilot.'
Professor Glendinning contributed to policy debates by using examples         from IBSEN in oral         evidence to the House of Commons Health Committee's 2010 investigation         into social care.
From this, the Committee concluded that, despite consensus in favour of         personalisation, 'the         details of implementation are contentious'6        The new Coalition Government's Vision for Adult Social Care7         Green Paper cited both the         main IBSEN evaluation and the linked carers study in support of its         proposals to `make         personal budgets the norm for everyone who receives ongoing care and         support'.
The Audit Commission report on PBs9 cited evidence from         IBSEN on the costs of IBs to justify         the expectation that personal budgets should be cost-neutral.
A review10 of the published literature on self-directed         support for the Scottish Government,         commissioned to aid policy decisions in this area, drew attention to         IBSEN as a core report in         this policy area in England.
It recommended the principles underpinning         IBs, as set out in the         `influential and detailed' IBSEN evaluation.
The South Australia State Minister for Disability and the Head of the         Disability Service visited         SPRU in 2011 to learn about the UK's experiences of implementing         personal budgets and to         discuss our recommendations.
Australia was starting to look at its         disability provision in order to         reform it and bring it up to date.
In 2013 Australia launched a new         disability insurance scheme         Disability Care Australia, with an emphasis on independence and control         for the service user         and including personal budgets to spend on care.
South Australia is one         of the launch sites for         this policy and fed into the debates about its creation.
There has been         subsequent research         collaboration between researchers in SPRU and Australia to compare         aspects of personal         budgets in each country.
The range of impacts demonstrates how the IBSEN research influenced the       final implementation of       personal budgets in England by highlighting the challenges in applying       this level of personalisation       at local and national levels, and by recommending where extra care was       needed for different user       groups.
It is an example which has been heeded by other countries as they       look to implement       more personalisation in their social care and health systems.
