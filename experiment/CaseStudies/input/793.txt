     Key insight: Osteoarthritis as a clinical syndrome of persistent           joint pain and disability       Our epidemiologic estimates of joint pain, osteoarthritis, and severity of       disability have informed central government and directed the         commissioning of clinical services for osteoarthritis across England       by underpinning the costing reports and templates produced by NICE and       rolled out nationally [1].
In specially commissioned work undertaken for       the Policy &amp; Public Affairs Unit of Arthritis Research UK in 2012-2013       presented in the report "Osteoarthritis in General Practice" to Parliament       in June 2013, cited in national health economic reports, and in national       press releases in July 2013, we have provided information for       policy-makers and third-sector organisations that has helped advance         the policy debate on health priorities for the nation and the NHS,       specifically towards greater recognition of the disability attributed to       musculoskeletal disorders and osteoarthritis in particular [2].
Our research has also directly influenced health professional         guidelines and training on clinical assessment, diagnosis and prognosis.
Members of our research team sat on national (NICE - Dziedzic, 2008; NICE       Update - Dziedzic, Porcheret 2013) and European (EULAR Hand - Dziedzic,       2009; EULAR Knee - Peat, 2010) guideline development groups where, in       addition to our epidemiologic estimates, our research on clinical       diagnosis and assessment underpinned recommendations for clinical (as       opposed to x-ray) diagnosis of osteoarthritis in routine practice [3].
Dissemination of this core message for practitioners has been actively       pursued by us through advising on the national Map of Medicine (Peat [4])       and NHS Patient Decision Aids (Wood, Myers) with these in turn forming the       basis for national knowledge summaries used by clinicians at the point of       care [5] as well as featuring in NHS Evidence and Osteoarthritis Research       Society International's OA Primer - an online educational resource for       practitioners and patients worldwide.
Key insight: High-risk occupations and causal exposures       The research on physical occupational exposures associated with knee       osteoarthritis was frequently cited and highly influential in the       Industrial Injuries Advisory Council's (IIAC) 2008 report on       osteoarthritis of the knee in miners [6] and in helping advance the         national policy debate to consider other similarly affected       occupational groups, notably carpet fitters and carpet and floor layers &#8212;       the subject of a later IIAC report in 2010.
Both IIAC reports were       presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions       and resulted in a change in legislation with Parliament approving       the addition of osteoarthritis of the knee in these occupational groups to       the prescribed list of industrial injuries (PDA14) with effect from 13       July 2009 [7] and 30 March 2012 respectively, resulting in benefits to         health and welfare for over 16,000 coalminers who were successfully       awarded claims [8].
Key insight: central importance of self-management and active           nonpharmacological management and the effective contribution of allied           health professionals to delivering these in primary care       Our research on the effectiveness of high-quality advice and supervised       exercise programmes for osteoarthritis and our commitment to seeing the       implementation of these in routine primary care contributed to exercise       becoming a core treatment recommended in successive NICE [3] and European       guidelines for all persons with osteoarthritis and directly challenging       both the belief that exercise is bad for joints with osteoarthritis by       accelerating `wear and tear' and the idea that `nothing can be done'.
Members of our research team sat on these guideline development groups       (Dziedzic, Porcheret, Mallen).
Our impact has extended beyond influencing health professional         guidelines to training health professionals to support the       implementation of these evidence-based changes to care.
Working with       Arthritis Research UK and the Royal College of General Practitioners,       Porcheret (GP research fellow and RCGP Clinical Champion for       Osteoarthritis 2008-2011) and co-workers at Keele developed     (i) a new e-learning module on osteoarthritis for primary care health       professionals [9] that to date has been completed by 606 individuals since       its launch in February 2013     (ii) a series of all-day workshops run across UK sites training 230 GPs       to date, and     (iii) a series of health care professional leaflets and topical evidence       digests [circulated to &gt;44,000 GPs] [10].
Regionally, our clinical researchers have provided practical,       face-to-face training for 44 GPs, 141 physiotherapists, 12 occupational       therapists, and 17 practice nurses from across the West Midlands and       Cheshire on the practical delivery of best evidence treatment for       osteoarthritis as part of our osteoarthritis studies, organised and run       `Sharing Best Practice' days, hosted a series of clinical appraisal topic       sessions with local health professionals, and shaping local clinical       algorithms and patient pathways.
Our Osteoarthritis Guidebook, developed       and co-authored with members of the public together with health       professionals and researchers at our Centre, has been made available       through our institutional website and that of Arthritis Research UK.
In a       set of local general practices it has been provided to over 500 people       consulting with osteoarthritis.
