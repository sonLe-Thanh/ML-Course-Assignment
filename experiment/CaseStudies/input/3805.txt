     This research has impacted on the knowledge-based activities of a range       of organisations and individuals involved in the use, enjoyment and       conservation of Scottish church buildings.
Beneficiaries form an extensive       user base, ranging from national and regional bodies responsible for       statutory administration, through archaeologists commissioned to       investigate the buildings, to bodies or individuals with an interest in       this aspect of Scotland's architectural heritage.
Reactions and a large       body of correspondence, of which only a sample can be mentioned here,       highlight the significance of this work for the cultural heritage of       Scotland as reflected in its diverse range of church buildings.
Cultural       heritage is an increasingly valuable contributor to both the economy and       the cultural life of Scotland; it constitutes a central plank of       Scotland's tourist industry, which is currently worth &#163;4.3bn per year.
INFORMING THE WORK OF STATE BODIES:     The Corpus has met an urgent need for accurate information as a       basis for reaching properly informed decisions on developments at Scottish       churches of medieval origin.
This was affirmed on 30 November 2011 by       Historic Scotland's Director of Policy and Outreach that `the material         is an enormous help as we prioritise and distinguish candidates for         designation and ensure that their entries are accurate, informative and         helpful' [S1].
The national recording body, the Royal       Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Scotland, also       welcomed information on the churches that is based on firmly grounded       research.
The Secretary (chief officer) of the Commission stated on 5       December 2011 that `the survey work and documentation produced by the         project to date is providing original and valuable research that         advances our understanding of the sites' [S2].
SUPPORTING THE ACTIVITIES OF LEARNED BODIES AND LOCAL SOCIETIES     The increased information on the churches has met a major need for both       national learned societies and local historical societies, and has made it       easier for those bodies to provide informed views on the churches.
Enthusiasm for the project is evidenced by the twelve illustrated lectures       that the investigators have so far been asked to provide.
These have       varied from a formal lecture on 3 October 2012 to the British       Archaeological Association in Burlington House in London, to a talk to a       local church group in Cupar on 24 April 2013.
Confirmation of the positive impact is provided by a letter of 24       November 2011 from the president of the Royal Archaeological Institute, to       which one lecture was given, which affirms `the signal importance of         such recording work which will form the basis for a wider understanding,         better appreciation of the conservation and management needs and the         springboard for suture actions' [S3].
PROVIDING AN AUTHORITATIVE BASIS FOR THE WORK OF PRACTITIONERS IN THE       FIELD     The architect of the Perth and Kinross Heritage Trust, an arm of Perth       and Kinross Council that is deeply involved in conservation of church       buildings, stated on 30 September 2011 that `the excellent work that         you and your colleagues have done...has been enormously useful in not         only helping us to make early assessments and prioritise the best         `targets' for our work...[but in] informing and developing the         interpretation material which we are developing' [S4].
Archaeologists commissioned to investigate and record the structures and       underlying deposits of churches likewise welcome the Corpus as a       resource to aid efficient and timely searches.
AOC Archaeology, a leading       body in such work in Scotland, referred to the Corpus on 15       October 2012 as being `an invaluable resource...with excellent         information and images provided by acknowledged experts, all of it         readily accessible to the researcher.
It provides a definitive statement         of...each church' [S5].
Further evidence of the increasingly diverse uses of the information       assembled in the Corpus, are the requests to take local history       and other groups on visits to churches in order to provide guidance on the       interpretation of architectural and documentary evidence, and also to give       those groups the confidence to provide their own guidance on questions of       conservation when the need arises.
Four of these have been a direct result       of talks about the project to local societies.
THE WEBSITE     The principal means of disseminating the findings of the project is the       freely available web site, which has an extended page for each of the 105         sites in the pilot phase area, together with an introductory       synthesis of all the information that has been gathered.
Between January       2010 and July 2013 the site had over 23,000 hits, with a steady       year-on-year increase.
Links to the website have been made available       through a number of online networks, including arts-humanities.net.
Links have also been requested by a number of bodies, including the Royal       Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland, and       Scottish Churches Architectural Research.
FURTHER EVIDENCE OF POSITIVE RESPONSE     There is an evident need for ongoing engagement with a range of interest       groups, and it was pleasing that the London-based Ecclesiological Society       selected the website as one of their websites         of the month (http://www.ecclsoc.org/).
One of the most significant indicators of the value placed on this work       was the invitation to Fawcett to deliver the prestigious six Rhind       lectures on 3-5 May 2013 to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, with       the support of (and in the lecture theatre of) the Royal Society of       Edinburgh (`Magnificent for the beauty and extent of its buildings and         worthy of everlasting fame' - the architecture of the Scottish late         medieval Church).
These lectures drew heavily on material assembled       in the course of the project.
As a particularly gratifying indication of positive reception, the pilot       phase of the project was so highly rated by AHRC's peer reviewers that a       grant with full economic costs of &#163;486,625 has been made for the second       phase of the project, running from 2012 to 2015, and covering the diocese       of St Andrews and Brechin.
The project has also been brought to wider       attention in a number of newspaper reports, as well as in a range of       electronic or published forms, including the following:     ScARF (Scottish Archaeological Research Framework),       www.scottishheritagehub.com/content/medieval       Salon (The Society of Antiquaries of London Newsletter), issue 265, 14       November 2011,     www.sal.org.uk/sandbox/salon/     The Society of Antiquaries of Scotland Newsletter, issue 265, 14 November       2011.
