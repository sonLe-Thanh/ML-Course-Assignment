     Process/events from research to impact       The impact derives from the development of the special purpose group       support software, Group         Explorer, and the associated methodology.
The impact from the use of       the software and       methodology arises from half/one-day workshops that are specifically       designed for attendance by       6-25 participants using the developed methodology (problem oriented causal       mapping) and Group         Explorer.
The participants are typically the members of the senior       team in an organisation.
The       research and application was undertaken in real organisational settings,       at the specific request of       the top management teams across a range of major organisations (see below       for examples) and       undertaken by Eden and Ackermann &#8212; and the impact was derived specifically       from these settings.

More Effective Collaboration and Conflict Resolution: One of       our regular workshops       includes 8 top team managers from EdF and 8 senior managers from the       Office for Nuclear       Regulation (ONR) in an effort to resolve dysfunctional behaviours between       the organisations (the       workshop was repeated and refined each year from 2006-until 2012).
The       Chief Inspector (ONR)       comments in his letter that "these strategic conversations,         independently facilitated using your         methodology and IT, have been time efficient and effective in developing         our strategies, internal         focus and external relationships" [Source 3].
Post workshop       interview notes from several named       Senior Civil Servants of the Department of Energy and Climate Change       (DECC) and from       members of the ONR top management team said, for example: "the model         helped catch people up         and develop a sort of common understanding.
We learnt a lot more about         each other.
.... the         mapping was very successful in deciding what needs to be done."
"The         structure of the [workshop]       - the format &#8212; takes out the negative elements... very different from         traditional meetings &#8212; it [the         GSS] provided a mechanism for honest discussion."
"The software         [GSS] was incredibly useful &#8212;         setting preferences and getting everything out in the open.
It would         have been much slower if         everyone had to speak (and we wouldn't have got that much on paper) ...         good conflict resolution         session with positive outcomes re attitudes and solid deliverables"       [Source 6].

Effective Strategic Problem solving and Nuclear New Build Risk         Assessment: The       Strathclyde approach is being used by a team of 10 senior managers from       EdF tasked with       addressing the development of a risk strategy (2011-2013).
In the case of       nuclear new build risk       assessment and collaborative multi-organisational working between the       Nuclear New Build team of       EdF and ONR, the participants expect there to be a significantly increased       probability of success,       and reduced risk in the construction of new nuclear power stations, than       would have been       otherwise.
The use of the system and methodology is to be extended by EdF       later in 2013 and       into 2014 [Source 1 and 2].

Effective Strategic Problem solving: This example involved a       Health Service Multi-organisational       group of 30 GP's, social workers, care home managers, and NHS senior       managers addressing the strategic issues associated with increasing       dementia (2008).
The       National Lead for Mental Health (the sponsor for the work) has written       that the system enabled       them to: "Understand their different perspectives around the key issues         that were impacting on the         functioning of the system.
This took some of the unhelpful `emotional         heat' out of the discussions         as individuals were able to understand that a different opinion was         based on a different model of         the world" (Ruth Glassboro, General Manager, Mental Health, Borders       NHS).

More Effective Collaboration: Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR)         and the Department for         Energy and Climate Change (DECC): This example from 2012 involved       three teams of senior       managers (two from DECC, and one from ONR).
A participant from DECC       speaking about the       workshops said "The software was incredibly useful &#8212; setting         preferences and getting everything         out in the open.
It would have been much slower if everyone had to         speak...good conflict         resolution session with positive outcomes regarding attitudes and solid         deliverables."
The CEO of       ONR at the time said "We agreed common goals &#8212; we can sort it out and         stop bickering...Actions         in place."
Meanwhile joint client Chief Nuclear Officer, ONR had       this to say, "astonished by the         capability of the system...would have taken us weeks to get where we got         to...behaviours seem to         have changed during the workshop: a more roundtable approach being         taken, and joint things         coming up by the end of the day".

Evaluating Competitive Advantage of Scotland: Scottish       Enterprise (SE) got together a group       of Scottish company CEOs to consider how Scotland could become more       competitive (2010).
The       SE sponsor said that "using both the Group Explorer system and the         mapping tool helped to draw         out the deep and underlying competencies that make our sectors         different...
I can't imagine any         other system or method that would enable us to have made as much         progress as we did in such a         short time" (Ian McMahon, Head of Engineering and Aerospace, SE).

Strategic Problem solving: The first example involved a group       of 18 NHS Consultants,       Hospital Chief Executives, Government Civil Servants responsible for       health provision, Senior       nursing staff, and NHS administrators tasked with addressing issues in       acute hospitals (2013).
The       Deputy Director of Health Performance states that "it was important for         us all because it gave us a         conversation where we could reach conclusions and prioritise.
We         finished up with agreements         that were neither NHS or Government, but rather a shared understanding         and agreement.
We `got         to a good place as a group'."

5b.Strategic Problem solving: In the second example (2011), a team       of senior managers from       Clydesdale Bank were assisted when seeking agreement about a strategy for       new working       practices across departments.
The Transformation Director at Clydesdale       Bank attests to the use       of the system over a number of years.
He argues that his decision to use       the approach was based       on "experience of it increasing productivity, the ability to draw on         multiple perspectives &#8212; often from         those who have unique views but do not contribute in larger groups and         most importantly to be         able to move quickly from idea to agreement to the governance of         delivery" (Kevin Page, Director       of Operations, Clydesdale Bank).

Developing Implementable Strategy: The first example involves       the top management team       of Balfour Beatty (25 people) a construction company.
The Chief Executive       writes: "This approach         had a transformation impact on the company with a reduction in         dysfunctional behaviours and an         increased ability to identify and agree joint goals".
"[The]         system helped protect anonymity in the       early part of the session and ensured that everything including highly         contentious items was put up         for debate and agreement.
The outcome was high levels of ownership and         commitment from the         two separate SMTs on the way forward."
"By 2008 annual sales had         reached &#163;300M with a         corresponding increase in profit.
Employee numbers increased to over         1700."

Developing Implementable Strategy: The second example concerns       the top management       team of Land Engineering (2013).
The team comment: "The process         followed was helpful...         particularly useful were the tools in being able to gather and arrange         everyone's thoughts into         something that was useful... we previously struggled with this".
"The         process helped us get past         some points where the interests of vocal individuals were not in the         shared interest of the group".

Organisational Change: Royal Bank of Scotland.
The sponsor       comments that "in a half day         meeting with the whole team involved in the change in our organisation,         we were able to gather         views, reach consensus and ensure everyone provided input rather than         just those who usually         speak loudest!"
"[This was] a strategic planning session for a         complex programme of change we         were developing using the Group Explorer system.
Usually, commencing a         programme of change         of that scale would require a series of workshops, and meetings to         define the scope of the         programme in detail, necessitating the need to collate complex and         varied views and reach         consensus over a period of weeks."

Risk Assessment: The workshop with Scottish and Southern Energy       help the company       Identify and explore the systemic relationship between strategic risks.
"Risks         attained beyond the         traditional top down risks identified through project risk registers"...       "the software and mapping         process enabled significant progress to be made in a very short period         of time &#8212; capturing and         structuring 100+ risks and subsequently prioritising them in as little         as half a day" (Frank Clifton,       Project Development Manager, SSE).
As the various corroborating sources testify, in all of the cases listed       above the application of the       developed methodology and group support system was, in summary, taken by       the participants to       have led to one or more beneficial impacts: changes in relationships,       reduction of dysfunctional       behaviours, an ability to address joint goals, an ability to share wisdom       and experience and       viewpoints, and an increased commitment to agreements than would normally       have been the case.
The workshops also created impact by improving working relationships:       degrees of trust, mutual       and deeper understanding, and appreciation of interacting but different       goals were significantly       improved.
In particular, the group support system facilitated designed       conversations that would not       have been possible using other formats, and allowed significantly       increased productivity by:       multiple conversations at one time, anonymity when appropriate, ease of       face saving, continuous       recording of `minutes' (`minutes' created by the group in real time), and       agreements developed in       context.
Global reach: The impact has been more geographically extensive       than just the UK with       workshops held with senior management `bid teams' within Bombardier       (Canada), and       management teams in the Netherlands (Reed-Elsevier), USA (various),       Luxemburg (SES),       Australia (Health) and Denmark.
