     The FOOD trials showed that (i) routine oral supplements had little       effect on outcomes, (ii) that in patients who could not swallow, early       tube feeding showed a trend towards improved survival, and (iii) that       early use of PEG was associated with worse functional outcomes.
Pathways to impact       The trial team conducted a substantial programme of dissemination       activities beyond the three primary results publications.
These included       many local, national and international conference presentations; materials       posted on the FOOD website (www.dcn.ed.ac.uk/food/);       co-authorship of a Cochrane review and secondary publications; and       engagement with guideline committees, including the National Institute for       Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Royal College of Physicians and       Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN).
Impact on public policy       The results of the FOOD trials have had direct implications for the       management of at least 100,000 stroke patients admitted to hospital each       year in the UK, and many of the 15 million patients with stroke each year       worldwide.
The results of the FOOD trials have been used as the basis for national       guidelines in the UK, Canada, Italy, Australia, Singapore and South Africa       [5.1-5.6].
The third edition of the UK National Clinical Guidelines for Stroke       (2008) references the FOOD trials 2 and 3 and recommends that a       nasogastric tube is used after 24-48 hours.
PEG may be considered within 4       weeks if the patient cannot tolerate nasogastric feeding, but otherwise       not until 4 weeks.
These guidelines were revised since the first edition       on the basis of the FOOD trials data.
Impact on health and welfare       1160 deaths prevented per year       Based on the estimates of effect seen in the FOOD trial 2 (a 5.8% absolute       reduction in death at 6 months &#8212; 58 deaths avoided/1000 patients) and       assumptions based on Dennis' 2003 survey of UK clinicians [3.4], 1160       additional patients would survive compared with a policy of avoiding tube       feeding for at least a week, which was common prior to publication of the       trials' results.
780 severe disabilities avoided per year       Based on the effect sizes seen in the FOOD trial 3 (7.8% absolute       difference in severe disability &#8212; 78 severely disabled patients/1000       treated with early PEG) and assumptions based on Dennis' 2003 survey       [3.4], 780 patients might avoid poor outcomes (severe disability) in the       UK each year by avoiding an early PEG tube insertion, with no effect on       survival.
Improved hospital experience for up to 40,000 patients per year       Based on the estimates of effect seen in the FOOD trial 1 and assumptions       based on Dennis' 2003 survey [3.4], up to 40,000 patients may now be       avoiding unnecessary supplements each year in the UK without a detriment       to their clinical outcome.
Many of those patients would have found the       supplement unpalatable, which would have had a detrimental effect on their       hospital experience.
Impact on the economy       As a result of FOOD trial 1, an estimated 40,000 patients in the UK each       year will avoid receiving routine oral supplements (&#163;10 per day).
Based on       an average hospital stay of 25 days, this amounts to a saving to the NHS       of &#163;250 per patient and &#163;10M per year.
According to a survey conducted by Dennis in 2003, 84% would, if       resources allowed, insert a PEG within the first 4 weeks.
Given the       prevalence of prolonged dysphagia, this is estimated to translate into       10,000 PEG insertions per year.
Avoiding these PEG insertions by using       nasogastric tube feeding will save the NHS approximately &#163;2M each year       (&#163;200 per PEG insertion).
In addition, the trials' findings suggested that early PEG insertion       might increase severe disability (78/1000 patients), resulting in 780 more       severely disabled patients per year; the associated costs of this are       possibly as much as &#163;40M if the total cost of caring for a severely       disabled stroke patient is estimated at about &#163;50K.
