     Armitage's research, outlined above, is based on a commitment to showing       the relevance and importance of poetry in the modern world and explores       poetry's power to speak to current culture about neglected zones,       experiences, histories, and trauma.
This cultural work has had three main       modes of impact: (i) cultural and educational impact through demonstrating       the importance of poetry for contemporary audiences, readers and citizens,       as well as informing them about the art form and its practitioners; other,       specific beneficiaries here include young writers, school teachers, and       pupils; (ii) emotional and attitudinal impact, through highlighting       cultural values and social assumptions, changing perceptions, and aiding       specific individuals and groups come to terms with, or understand,       experiences; and (iii) social and economic impact, through collaboration       with local communities, arts organisations, and publishers.
Cultural and Educational Impact     Armitage has consistently promoted poetry as a medium and for its ability       to change people's perceptions, be they of the past, as with the Death         of King Arthur creative translation project, or of the present, as       with the Black Roses piece.
As Kate Kellaway wrote of The         Death of King Arthur in The Guardian (19 Feb 2012), Armitage       `has a miraculous ability to make the past fresh, moving and urgent,         not allowing legend to create distance'.
His poetry has global reach       and impact and his readership extends well beyond the academy [S1]: for       example, The Death of King Arthur was reviewed in the tabloid and       broadsheet press in the UK and abroad (e.g.
Chicago Times, New         York Daily News), as well as on personal blogs; it featured on lists       of `recommended reads' in publications such as the men's magazine GQ       (29 May 2012); it garnered Armitage numerous invitations to literary       festivals in the UK (e.g.
Hay-on-Wye, June 2013) and abroad (e.g.
Jaipur,       January 2013).
The wide reach of Armitage's work and its underpinning philosophy about       the cultural role and communicative power of poetry have led to him       becoming one of the UK's leading champions for the place of poetry and the       arts in today's society, informing the wider public about poetic       traditions and processes, and demonstrating the ability of the poetic       imagination to provide a form of commemoration and historical recovery and       of giving voice to both marginalised and traumatic experience.
His public       role as disseminator of poetry's power to speak to us is measurable       through the sheer number and variety of commissions that his work has       triggered in the national media.
Since 2011, he has presented five major       BBC documentaries which demonstrate this range: Oblique Strategies       (Radio 4, 2013) explored the creative process through investigating       approaches used by Brian Eno and David Bowie in the 1970s (and indicates       the more absurdist turn of recent work); Staying Bright (Radio 3,       2013) looked at the history and cultural place of stainless steel -       particularly in the north of England &#8212; over the century since its       discovery; Poems from the Pennines (Radio 4, 2012) put the `Stanza       Stones' project within a longer tradition of landscape art; Down Off         The Pedestals (Radio 4, 2011) brought to a wider audience two       neglected 19th-century dialect poets, Samuel Laycock and Ammon       Wrigley; The Pendle Witch Child (BBC4, 2011) uncovered the lethal       power of words in one of British history's most infamous 17th-century       witch trials.
As such, all five programmes were closely connected to, and       grew out of, key local/regionalist and historical strands of Armitage's       research.
Armitage has also appeared on BBC1's Countryfile (2012,       on the Stanza Stones), BBC2's Review Show (various appearances       2011, 2012); ITV's Britain's Secret Homes (2013, talking about the       radical poet William Blake); BBC2's The Culture Show (on The       Smiths, 2013); and a BBC 4 documentary on Ford Madox Ford's First World       War trilogy Parade's End (2012).
The impact of these media       appearances has been to make poetry, and literature more generally, a       living art for wider, non-academic audiences.
Armitage's poetry has had a specific impact on school-children, through       the inclusion of his poems on the AQA GCSE syllabus (including the       currently uncollected `Harmonium', which will be published in 2014 in Paper         Aeroplane: New Selected Poems 1989-2014).
Armitage has further       supported secondary-school learning through his contribution to the BBC's       Learning Zone of six short films (2011) in which he unpacks the techniques       and imagery used in those of his poems included on the GCSE syllabus.
The         Death of King Arthur was also issued in 2012 by W. W. Norton, a       leading USA-based publisher of undergraduate and secondary school teaching       texts.
Armitage has also had significant educational impact through his role as       mentor.
He has established productive, durable links with arts       organizations in Yorkshire and with schools and youth groups from across       the socio-economic spectrum.
His 2012 Stanza Stones project, for example,       involved leading workshops with six groups of writers aged 12-26 to       produce an anthology of poetry, as well as dance and dramatic performances       [S8].
This was one of two projects that Armitage led for the 2012 Cultural       Olympiad: the projects are evidence of his impact as a poet, but they also       speak to his commitment and ability to reach multiple audiences.
Whilst       the Stanza Stones project was rooted in the Pennine landscape of his       childhood and involved mentoring young, inexperienced writers, the second,       Poetry Parnassus, took place at London's Southbank Centre [S7] and was       conceived and curated during his time as artist-in-residence there (2012).
It was the largest poetry festival ever staged in the UK, involving 204       published poets from practically every country in the world [S5][S6].
Its       aim was to popularize poetry as a global human activity, central to every       nation's cultural sense of itself and enabling connection, through       translation, to other cultures (aims that underpin Armitage's Death of         King Arthur).
Over 100 events &#8212; from conventional poetry readings       and talks on topics such as the relationship between poetry and politics,       to pop-up performances and public classrooms along the South Bank &#8212; were       designed to strip poetry of its aura of exclusivity and intimidation.
The       events were attended by thousands, in London and at regional events as       part of its national tour, and resulted in the publication of an       anthology, The World Record, edited by Neil Astley and Anna Selby       (Bloodaxe         Books and Southbank Centre, 2012) and an interactive international       poetry map, made available to a global audience through the Guardian       website (26 June 2012).
The impact of Armitage's contributions to the       Cultural Olympiad has been to nurture future generations of readers and       poets, aiding the sustainability and vitality of this art form.
Further to       that, there is additional impact on the young writers participating in the       Stanza Stones project, who benefitted from increased understanding and       appreciation of their local environment, its place in the cultural       tradition, and their own capacity to participate within that tradition:       factors which enhance quality of life and cultural capital.
Emotional and Attitudinal Impact     The impact of Armitage's use of poetry as a communicative medium, with       the power to change perceptions and give expression to marginalised or       traumatic experience, is particularly evident from the reception of Black         Roses: 1776 copies had been sold [S2] to 31 July 2013, and 1457       seats were sold at the Royal Exchange production in September 2012 [S4].
This poetic drama (first broadcast on Radio 4) did not merely reach a       diverse audience through a variety of media: it also had a profound impact       on those audiences [S3], as captured on the Radio 4 website.
Illustrative       comments, testifying to the transformative power of the piece, include the       following: `A painful listen, but one that has changed me as a         person'; `A brilliant piece of drama.
I wasn't going to listen         but thought I'd give it 5 minutes to see what it was like.
I was hooked         immediately'; `Wonderful play making us face up to reality [...]         This needs to be part of sixth form curriculum across the country';       `The programme was a testament to the power of poetry.
A perfect         illustration of the need for continued funding for the arts'.
Also       see the Royal Exchange comments pages [S4]: `Such an important         production especially for young people to see'; `I heard the         radio broadcast, so moving it had me in tears and I had to listen to it         again when I got home.
Such tragic end to such a promising life, my         heart goes out to Sophie's friends and family'.
Armitage's drama has       had a further positive impact: a third of the cover price from sales of       the book version goes to the Sophie Lancaster Foundation, a charity       dedicated to countering prejudice and intolerance.
The broadcast version       also led to a `More than Words' listening workshop run by the BBC where       members of the public could talk to Sue Roberts, producer of Black         Roses, and Sylvia Lancaster, Sophie's mother.
The play had       spontaneous impact too: teenagers from the Royal Exchange Young Company       and Burnley Youth Theatre watched the play in September 2012 and shared       their thoughts and feelings about the performance.
In February 2013, the       Young Company and members then attended six creative writing workshops,       exploring the themes and style of the play, whilst the Burnley group       explored their responses through improvisation, discussion and devised       drama.
The focused reflection on their own affective responses to the play       helped them not only realize the emotional trauma of the family, but       enabled a local sense of emotional solidarity.
Social and Economic Impact     Armitage's work as a poet and his role as champion of the arts has       benefitted independent publishing, encouraged widening participation, and       aided a variety of arts organizations, especially those which use local       resources or connections to enrich the lives of the community through the       arts.
Since 2011 this commitment is evidenced through his use of the small       independent press Pomona for the publication of Black Roses [S2],       his work with young writers (for example, on the Stanza Stones project),       and his continued active patronage of the Yorkshire Sculpture Park (his       residency involves readings and publications), the Arvon Foundation (a       creative writing charity for which he teaches), the Wordsworth Trust       (where he contributes to the Wordsworth Trust Poetry Series), and the       Elmet Trust (a charity which celebrates the poetry of Ted Hughes in the       village in which he was born and brought up, for which Armitage does       poetry walks and other events).
Armitage has also helped sustain local arts organizations within       Sheffield, most particularly The Poetry Business [S9] (an independent       poetry press and writer development agency), Bank Street Arts (a       cross-disciplinary arts centre), and Off the Shelf (Sheffield's       annual literary festival): the localism of Armitage's creative work led       directly to these collaborations.
This engagement with the local community       has been consolidated through the annual Lyric poetry festival,       inaugurated in 2011 and co-curated with Dr Joanna Gavins (School of       English), and the city-wide week-long Sheffield Poetry Festival, founded       2012 with Armitage as patron.
Lyric brings over 1500 people each year to       the University over the course of a weekend and is now being developed to       include a range of community-based workshops.
The Poetry Festival features       over 50 poets and 500 visitors, whilst promoting local and national poetry       presses.
Testament to Armitage's impact on the city's cultural scene is       provided by the directors of The Poetry Business, who have spoken of how       activities such as Lyric and the Sheffield Poetry Festival have `made a         genuine difference to how [they] work across the city'.
