     Ethical particularism is important in this case study because it is now       being discussed and debated within the legal profession, not just among       scholars but also practitioners.
Specifically, tort lawyers have taken       cognizance of ethical particularism in the context of whether and to what       extent negligence determinations should be left to a jury, given the       variation of features across similar cases and the impossibility of       proposing hard and fast negligence rules.
In addition, particularism has become an important part of general       ethical debate among the public.
This has partly arisen serendipitously,       via opportunities presented to Dancy, and capitalised on by him, to       publicise his research to a broad audience.
He has on various occasions       presented his theory in an accessible way to non-academics, using concrete       examples of moral reasoning to illustrate abstract ideas in an engaging       and provocative way &#8212; especially the clash between our belief in       exceptionless general principles of morality, and our willingness to make       exceptions and qualifications in particular cases     Impact on the legal profession     Dancy's particularist theory has &#8212; in a way that is rare for the work of       a philosopher who is not a jurisprude &#8212; entered legal discourse as a       theory to be taken seriously in helping lawyers understand recent and past       rulings.
The most important evidence of the impact of particularism in the law       comes from the American Law Institute's (ALI's) Restatement of the Law of       Torts, 3rd edition, pub.
2010.
ALI Restatements are internationally       recognised as highly significant legal documents.
They are essentially       codifications of case law, i.e.
common law judge-made doctrines that       develop gradually over time.
Although Restatements are not binding       authority in and of themselves, they reflect the consensus of the American       legal community as to what the law is (and in some areas, what it should       become).
There are then good grounds for viewing the Restatements as the       most influential secondary authority in this area.
The above Restatement       (Ch.3 sec.8) says: `Tort law has thus accepted an ethics of particularism,       which tends to cast doubt on the viability of general rules capable of       producing determinate results and which requires that actual moral       judgments be based on the circumstances of each individual situation.
Tort       law's affirmation of this requirement highlights the primary role       necessarily fulfilled by the jury.'
The citation for this passage names Dancy as the progenitor of       particularism and refers to a paper of his from 1983.
It is extremely rare       for a contemporary philosopher to receive mention in an ALI Restatement       (indeed we are aware of no other examples).
Although this citation refers       to a very early publication which predates Dancy's employment at Reading,       it is clear that it is the theory of particularism itself, developed over       several decades and reaching its mature and complete form in 2004, that       has led to the impact here, as opposed to a single early paper.
This       assumption has been confirmed by email correspondence with the lawyer in       charge of the project.
Furthermore, it is worth stressing that this impact       is on legal practice itself, not merely on academic discussion.
The theory       of particularism is providing part of the intellectual toolkit by which       legal practitioners conceptualise and structure their domain, with ensuing       changes and benefits to practice and understanding amongst this community.
The reach of particularism into judicial practice is also discussed in         a paper in the Hofstra Law Review, 2008.
Here an academic lawyer argues         that a preference for particularism explains the way in which judges         decide certain cases and he makes explicit reference numerous times to         Dancy.
Again, the point to stress here is that it is the judges and         lawyers on whom particularism is held to have had an influence, even if         it may be through the medium of academic legal interpretation: the         decisions judges reach are being shaped by, and can best be understood         by practitioners in terms of, ethical particularism.
Finally, a recent US Supreme Court decision, Hosanna-Tabor (2012) has         received much discussion amongst legal experts.
One blog, Mirror of         Justice, discusses it at some length, with the author, a legal academic,         referring to the work of Dancy and `judicial particularism' as a way of         interpreting the decision.
This leads to posts by a non-academic (as it         seems) debating the issue with the author         (http://mirrorofjustice.blogs.com/mirrorofjustice/2012/01/what-does-it-mean-to-call-a-judicial-opinion-particularist.html).
If         the interpretation by the original post's author is correct, then it can         also be claimed with plausibility that particularism has influenced the         Supreme Court justices themselves, even if they have not heard of Dancy         by name.
Given the influence and importance of ALI Restatements and the         recentness of this evidence of impact, we think it reasonable to suggest         that the impact seen thus far, though significant in its own right, also         constitutes only the initial stages of potential impact.
The Department         is committed to working closely with Dancy to consolidate the impact of         his research in this crucial area, ensuring maximum reach for his         important philosophical work.
General impact outside academia     Dancy's research has also found its way into the arena of general public       debate about morality:            Dancy, extremely unusually for a professional philosopher, was invited         to appear on a popular TV show in 2010.
His interview on the US         late-night talk show The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson (audience         1.4 million) was devoted almost entirely to explaining moral         particularism to a general audience, which Dancy did admirably well.
Not         only was the interviewer enthralled, but follow-up comments on the         Internet show non-academics engaging with the topic.
Ferguson himself         joked that the research was just the thing to appeal to the 18-35 `kids'         in his audience demographic.
The cultural reach of moral particularism is also evidenced by a         lengthy discussion, with Dancy prominently named, in a 2013 article for         the digital magazine Aeon (which `seeks to invigorate conversations         about worldviews...open to diverse perspectives and committed to         progressive social change').
The discussion has thus far generated 62         comments from interested lay readers (http://tinyurl.com/ompx87e),         together with 1000 `likes' on Facebook and 200 tweets.
Members of the public engaged with Colin Allen and Jonathan Dancy in         general ethical debate about whether there could be `moral machines' in         the blog On The Human (2011).
Allen, an academic, tries to use Dancy's         particularism (cited by name) in the context of defending the         possibility of `moral machines' or `moral robots' capable of responding         to novel and variable moral situations rather than being programmed         (impossibly) to follow general principles.
This leads to a response by         Dancy himself, debating with Allen over the extent of their         agreement/disagreement, as well as a number of non-academics weighing in         with various opinions about particularism and the possibility of moral         machines.
A blog for discussion of theology and philosophy of religion (2010)         contains posts by non-academics discussing moral particularism, with         Dancy mentioned by name.
His Stanford Encyclopaedia article on moral         particularism is cited, as well as the Wikipedia entry on him.
Finally, Dancy's Philosophy Bites podcast (a series aimed at         presenting philosophical research in a format accessible for         non-specialists), discussing moral particularism, has been downloaded         nearly 49,000 times.
We can very safely be sure that the vast majority         of downloaders are non-academics for whom the podcasts are designed.
Again, we take this as evidence that his work has helped to inform and         shape views about morality among this group.
Beneficiaries     Lawyers are now seeing particularism as a way of understanding judicial       determinations, especially in negligence cases (see for instance the       discussion of the decisions made by Justice Stevens at http://www.scotusblog.com/2010/04/justice-stevens-particularist/).
It has caused them to reflect on whether general principles can actually       determine a decision in factually similar cases.
Members of the public who have expressed opinions about the theory are       divided as to its strength.
Some see it as a challenge to the very idea of       objectivity in ethics, others as a welcome alternative to a rigorously       rule-based application of morality to various situations.
Some have       clearly been stimulated to apply particularist thinking to their own       specific concerns.
All are provoked and challenged by the theory to think       more deeply about the content of an ethical system.
Reach and significance     It is hard to think of a much more significant impact on the American       legal profession than being mentioned in an ALI Restatement.
Together with       the articles and online discussion cited above, we think this can ground a       claim for the highly significant reach of particularism in the profession.
Furthermore we know from a 2010 Wake Forest Law Review study that nearly       one third of US Supreme Court decisions cite academic articles published       in law reviews (http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the_high_bench_vs._the_ivory_tower/),       suggesting that the impact of particularism is also being enhanced by its       discussion in academic legal journals.
As far as wider cultural impact is       concerned, as with most philosophy it is hard to assess the number of       people influenced by a position or theory.
The Craig Ferguson show       regularly attracts around 1.4 million viewers, of whom one can be certain       that thousands would at least have been challenged by the interview to       think more about ethical decision-making.
Again, intensity of influence is       difficult to measure.
Some viewers were sufficiently interested to read up       on particularism, especially Dancy's article in the Stanford       Encyclopaedia; one found the theory `very appealing' and wondered whether       further reading might `keep me from sleeping tonight'.
Evidence     In the case of Dancy's impact on legal reasoning in general and judicial       reasoning in particular, the evidence is that cited above.
Furthermore,       there are a significant number of references to Dancy's work on ethical       particularism in various other legal journals, including his most recent       work such as the 2004 book, as well as secondary literature discussing his       theory.
These include The Supreme Court Review (2004), The Stanford Law       Review (2002), The University of Chicago Law Review (2008), The Modern Law       Review (2005), and The Oxford Journal of Legal Studies (2009).
There are two points to make about this evidence.
First, all of these       publications are contributed to and read by legal academics, who then       disseminate the ideas at conferences and workshops, where they often       become the common currency of debate within the legal profession itself.
We cannot prove that judicial particularist leanings in various decisions       such as Hosanna-Tabor were informed by ideas that originated in academic       journals.
Judges do not usually cite academic works or opinions in their       decisions (but see above concerning the US Supreme Court).
Nor, however,       do their interpretations of the law emanate from nothing more than their       personal and idiosyncratic predilections.
Rather, their judicial work is       informed by, and taps into, the existing climate of debate over       interpretation, policy, the use of precedent, etc.
This debate is to a       large extent shaped by the original work of academic specialists, some of       whom are practitioners themselves.
Secondly, judges and legal       practitioners read academic journals and are directly informed by their       contents.
We are therefore confident that Dancy's particularism has had an       impact, albeit indirect and via academic discussion in legal journals, on       non-academic thinking in the legal profession.
In the case of Dancy's work as it pertains to the wider community, there       can be no doubt that particularism has become a lively topic of discussion       among philosophically interested members of the public.
The examples above       are typical.
And here is a TV critic for Entertainment Weekly commenting       on Dancy's appearance on the Craig Ferguson show:     "True to his desire, Ferguson hosted a segment with Dancy last night.
May       I say that I not only found it a more entertaining segment than the one       that had preceded it &#8212; someone named Robin Williams was the first guest &#8212;       but that I want to take a class with Professor Dancy right now?
Dancy is a       very big cheese in his field.
[He] came very close to making a dunderhead       like me understand what he was getting at in making distinctions between       right and wrong and the context in which such terms have meaning.
If, say,       PBS still stood for what it used to (that is, educational programming for       the good of the nation rather than a few good shows sprinkled into a       schedule of antiquing and repair series), Jonathan Dancy would be doing       for moral particularism what Robert Hughes once did for modern art in The       Shock of the New: teaching us via vivid language and examples.
I found       Prof. Dancy exhilarating.
How about you?"
(http://watching-tv.ew.com/2010/04/02/craig-ferguson-jonathan-dancy-claire-danes/,       2 April 2010).
There follow 79 comments, quite a few of them mentioning Dancy.
Typical       comments include: `I was so confounded during that interview and at the       same time, I didn't want it to end' and `I felt as if I had been invited       to sit in on a conversation rather than being "performed" to, which was       down to both Ferguson and Dancy.'
