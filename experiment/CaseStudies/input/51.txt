     The impact of Sobrevilla Perea's research has been achieved principally       through her interventions in the public debate on the present-day       political situation in Peru.
These interventions are deeply informed by       her historical perspective, and bear upon questions of political       legitimacy and the role of constitutions and elections therein.
Key focal       points for this impact have included the Fujimori trial (2008-9) and the       2011 presidential elections.
The impact of Sobrevilla Perea's project to       digitize provincial newspaper collections in Peru (2009-13) has been to       ensure wide public access to this historical material, which can also       inform current political debate.
Impact activities:             Blogs on the Fujimori trial.
In January 2008, Sobrevilla Perea         was invited by the human rights organization Coordinadora Nacional de         Derechos Humanos to act as an observer at the trial of the former         president of Peru, Alberto Fujimori.
She met with victims of the human         rights abuses perpetrated during his regime, including both the only         surviving victim of the killing in Barrios Altos and the         relatives of those `disappeared' at La Cantuta.
After the trial,         Sobrevilla Perea wrote an editorial published in a blog           in Peru and a           blog in Argentina, which sparked a debate in Peru and Argentina         over Fujimori's legacy (since the Barrios Altos case was         instrumental in bringing to an end amnesty laws in both countries).
Two articles in Argumentos, the journal of Peru's most         important think-tank, the Instituto de Estudios Peruanos.
In `Las           elecciones peruanas: reflexiones a base de la historia de la larga           duraci&#243;n' (April 2011), Sobrevilla Perea offered an historically         informed perspective on the Peruvian elections.
In `&#191;Darle           una segunda oportunidad al Fujimorismo?'
(June 2011), she         encouraged voters to consider the possibly devastating consequences of         Keiko Fujimori's election as president.
Public talks and workshops resulting in media engagement.
Following her participation in the online discussion, Sobrevilla Perea         was invited to deliver a series of public talks in the UK on the 2011         Peruvian election, aimed at mixed audiences of academics, journalists,         and Peruvian voters living in the UK.
The first of these talks was         delivered at Senate House, University of London, on 3 June 2011, two         days before the elections.
This talk was attended by journalists from         the Economist, the Guardian, and the BBC.
After the         election, Sobrevilla Perea was invited to give a talk on the election         results at the London School of Economics on 17 June 2011.
This was         followed by an invitation to participate as one of the main speakers at         the annual event of the Peru Support Group, held on 29 October 2011,         analysing the first 100 days of Humala's presidency.
In June-July 2013,         Sobrevilla Perea organized a series of workshops with young people in         Peru to reflect on the long-term understanding of the events that took         place in Peru in the 1980s.
These workshops used documentaries, videos,         and video blogs on social platforms (Facebook and Twitter) to spark a         debate on the importance of history in the understanding of politics and         of collective memory on the tenth anniversary of the publication of the         Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Peru.
Newspaper and television.
One of Sobrevilla Perea's most         important activities in the on-going debate around Peruvian political         processes has been a newspaper           article published in the Guardian on 17 June 2011.
This         article highlighted the plight of the women who underwent forced         sterilization in the 1990s.
The article has contributed to the campaign         for the reopening of the judicial case against those responsible for the         sterilization programme.
Sobrevilla Perea was also interviewed on the         Aljazeera television programme Listening Post (broadcast on 24         September 2011), to discuss the way in which the press covered the 2011         Peruvian presidential election, and on Jueves a las 3 p.m. con           Patricia del R&#237;o (broadcast on 14 June 2013), to discuss her work         with young people on memory.
Reach of the impact:            Over the past five years, Sobrevilla Perea has established herself as         a public intellectual in Peru, and in March 2012 she was identified as         one of the eight most influential `nuevas voces en temas de realidad         nacional' in Revista Somos (the Saturday supplement to the         Peruvian national newspaper El Comercio).
Her June 2011 article in Argumentos was the second most widely         read article in the journal that year, and sparked a campaign among         111,000 participants on Facebook and Twitter on the legacy of Fujimori         and the 2011 presidential election, as well as on several well-known         political blogs in Peru, where it was linked and discussed during the         election.
Her April 2011 article in Argumentos was the third         most widely read article in the journal during the same period, and it         also circulated widely on Facebook and Twitter.
Several blogs have         subsequently included links to it.
Lawyer Fran&#231;ois Peglau commented:         `This article circulated like wildfire over the web and was a very         useful tool in the debate.'
The meeting at Senate House, London, on 3 June 2011 was attended by         over 60 people, including representatives of the two election         candidates, journalists from the Economist, the Guardian,         and the BBC, investors from the City of London, and members of the         general public.
The financial consultant Julius Abensur wrote: `I was         extremely impressed at [Sobrevilla Perea's] ability to present a         dispassionate analysis of the political scenarios unfolding in Peru'         (5.7).
Lawyer Fran&#231;ois Peglau wrote that Sobrevilla Perea was able to         supply a `perspective with her historical analysis, which enriched the         discussion' (5.7).
Journalists and members of the general public,         alongside academics and over 30 students, attended Sobrevilla Perea's         talk at the London School of Economics on 17 June 2011.
Maria Luisa         Palomino, a participant from Peru, remarked that Sobrevilla Perea         `demonstrated in-depth knowledge of the topic under discussion' (5.7),         while Alejandra Irigoin (Lecturer in Economic History, LSE) wrote:         `Bringing the long historical sweep of the politics of exclusion in a         place like Peru made for a much richer understanding of the crossroads         where the country and indeed the region stand today' (5.7).
Sobrevilla Perea's July 2011 article in the Guardian was         widely circulated in Peru via blogs, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as         being syndicated worldwide.
The Aljazeera television programme Listening           Post, on which she appeared in September 2011, was broadcast to an         international audience in the millions.
The event held at the National Library in Lima as part of the         provincial newspaper digitization project (see section 3 above) was         attended by more than 100 people.
These included representatives from         the most important national newspapers in Peru - El Peruano,           El Comercio, Correo, and La Rep&#250;blica - as well as         from state institutions and museums, alongside librarians and         archivists.
Significance of the impact:     According to the lawyer Fran&#231;ois Peglau, the impact of Sobrevilla Perea's       research in both informing and changing the quality of the political       debate around the 2011 election was significant, especially given the       small margin (3%) by which Fujimori lost the election to Humala (5.7).
In       November 2011, the judicial process against those accused of being       responsible for the forced sterilization programme commenced at the       Inter-American Court.
Since the medical records of the sterilized women       have been destroyed, the judicial process will only be able to proceed on       the basis of testimonies.
Ines Ruiz (under the supervision of Sobrevilla       Perea) began taking testimonies from women in the communities of       Huancabamba in the northern Peruvian Andes in 2012.
Josefa Ramirez Pe&#241;a       from the Instituto de Apoyo al Movimiento Aut&#243;nomo de Mujeres Campesinas       wrote that, after the first visit, `over 100 women have been inspired to       come forward and present their cases to strengthen the judicial process'.
The other strand of Sobrevilla Perea's work that is having significant       impact is the creation of a centralized repository for digital collections       of Peruvian newspapers.
Providing easy and cost- effective access for a       wider general public to historical newspapers will substantially improve       the quality of political debate.
Sobrevilla Perea's British Library-funded       project has already resulted in a collaboration between the largest       holders of newspapers in Peru (El Comercio, La Rep&#250;blica,       Pontificia Universidad Cat&#243;lica del Per&#250;, and El Peruano), and the       creation of a centralized catalogue at the National Library in Lima.
This       work has also ensured the preservation of newspaper collections in       Huancavelica and Ayacucho.
