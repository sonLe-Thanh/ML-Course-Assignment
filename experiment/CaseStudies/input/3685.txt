     IMPACTS.
The research in section 2 had impacts through public engagement,       influence over the terms of the debate about targets, and downstream       policy changes, especially in devolved governments.
Bevan's research has       featured in the media and led to personal invitations to policy debate.
It       also provided a model for other research enquiries into health services       and school systems, and into emerging policies for policing.
Public engagement            2009: Bevan's research featured in a BBC Radio 4 programme, Analysis &#8212;         In Defence of Targets [7].
2009: Bevan was invited by the editor of the British Medical           Journal to participate in a debate on `Have targets done more harm         than good in the English NHS?'
[8].
2011: Bevan was invited by an editor of the British Medical           Journal to review the evidence that competition between hospitals         improves clinical quality [9].
2013 Bevan and Wilson were invited to a House of Lords/Parliamentary         Seminar on Benchmarking Public Services for Excellent Performance, to         present their paper on models of governance of the NHSs and schools in         England and Wales.
Public engagement also had an international dimension:            2010: Bevan was interviewed by and quoted in the WHO's report         on assessment of the performance of health systems [10].
2012: Bevan was invited to contribute to seminars at the World Bank on         performance measurement in developing countries &#8212; the papers by Bevan         and Hood [2] and Bevan and Hamblin [3] are posted on the World Bank         website.
Influencing the terms of the debate and policymakers            2010: The Report by Connolly et al [3] was covered extensively in the         media and by the Scottish Parliament, with defensive responses in Wales         and Scotland, as described by Timmins [11].
2011: Bevan's research was cited by Burgess et al [12], who analysed         the `natural experiment' between England and Wales in terms of         performance in GCSEs at age 16.
This study produced strong evidence that devolution resulted in worse         grades in Welsh schools relative to those in England.
2011: Peter Preston in The Guardian [13] cited Bevan's research as         evidence of the effectiveness of governance by targets in commenting on         the shift to a quasi-market model for the English NHS by the then         Secretary of State for Health.
2013: The Nuffield Trust Report on public reporting of performance,         written for Jeremy Hunt, the new Secretary of State for Health in         England, extensively cited Bevan's research into `star ratings [14].
2013: Guilfoyle [15], a serving Police Inspector, cites the research         by Bevan and Hood [2] which identified scope for gaming in response to         targets in his account of how he improved performance in his police         force.
Guilfoyle argued that the inflexible nature of targets in         policing led to such dysfunctional consequences that they should not be         used in attempts to improve performance of the police.
Policy changes     In addition to its influence on the terms of debate, Bevan's research is       also strongly associated with policy changes in the health services of the       four devolved nations through its contribution to an evidence base about       targets, which the devolved governments could not ignore.
Timmins, who was       public policy editor of the Financial Times between 1996 and 2011,       and is now a senior fellow at both the King's Fund and the Institute for       Government, is the author of Report published by the Kings Fund, which is       the most influential health policy think tank in the UK.
His Report [11]       draws on research by experts on each country's NHS and provides evidence       of the impact of Bevan's research.
His Report states, "In terms of       day-to-day management of the NHS ... one of the most obvious examples of       lessons learnt is over the use of targets" (p 13).
He made three points to       justify that statement.
First, the strength of the research evidence: "there is no doubt       that `targets and terror', as the approach was originally dubbed by Gwyn       Bevan and Christopher Hood, worked in England by focusing management       effort on reducing waiting times as a key priority (Bevan and Hood 2006;       Propper et al 2007).
In England they duly fell, sharply and steadily.
By       2005, even despite the difficulty of directly comparing waiting times between       the countries, it was clear that waiting times within countries       were coming down faster in England than in Scotland, Wales or Northern       Ireland" (p 13).
Second, the shift by governments in the devolved countries from       initial rejection of, to following, the approach taken in England:       "Initially, Wales rejected, and Scotland was at best lukewarm, about the       target-driven approach to waiting times that the English NHS adopted,       ahead of the re-introduction of choice and competition" (p 13); but, given       the evidence, by 2005, decided to follow suit the English approach,       "adopting such targets, and in each case waiting times fell" (p 13).
Third, "the coalition government in England, having first given the       impression that it was abandoning waiting time targets, has now reaffirmed       them" [11, p 14].
WHY DOES THE IMPACT MATTER?
Improved governance leads to improved       performance of public services in terms of the objectives that matter to       the public and hence to governments, such as reducing long hospital       waiting times and good performance in GCSEs at age 16.
The `natural       experiment' following devolution shows which types of governance are and       are not effective in achieving highly salient measures of performance of       public services.
