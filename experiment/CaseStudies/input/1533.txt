     CAC's research into the role of the Arts in criminal justice has       generated impact characterised       by both reach and significance, which we have detailed below through       reference to a range of       outcomes encompassing various audiences and user groups.
In the face of concerns about the public acceptability of Arts projects       in prisons, CAC's research       has been instrumental in establishing and maintaining a good reputation       for such projects within the       CJS through provision of robust, rigorous evidence of their effectiveness.
In 2008, PSI-50 was published by National Offender Management Services       (NOMS).
As a result       of this, HM Prison Service &#8212; and in particular individual prison governors       &#8212; became wary of inviting       external arts organisations to work in their prisons.
Consequently, the       Arts Alliance (hereafter `AA' &#8212; the       national body for promoting arts in the Criminal Justice System) launched       a campaign against PSI-50,       using, amongst other evidence, CACs research on the Arts to demonstrate       their value.
The Manager of       the AA has stated with reference to CAC's research, "The provision of         robust evidence for the benefit of         the Arts Alliance in demonstrating the impact of arts programmes in the         rehabilitation of offenders is         useful in making our case when trying to influence the wider policy         debate.
We hold regular meetings         with key policy makers at the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the National         Offender Management Services         (NOMS), where such evidence is crucial".
In addition, the Manager of       the AA has further stated, "The         report co-authored by Dr Laura Caulfield and David Wilson about Good         Vibrations music project:         Continuing Positive Change in Prison and Community (2010), is quoted in         a paper, which will be taken         to the `Beyond Employability' Round Table event hosted by Prisoner         Education Trust on 26th June         (2013).
Having robust evidence such as this is the key to enabling arts         interventions to continue in         criminal justice settings and communities and is hugely valuable to our         membership".
In 2010 the then       Justice Minister Crispin Blunt, in rescinding PSI-50, stated `We recognise       that Arts activities can play a       valuable role in helping offenders to address issues such as communication       problems and low self-esteem       and enabling them to engage in programmes that address their offending       behaviour'.
CAC has continued to generate impact through the AA in providing evidence       of improved       offender outcomes.
The AA Evidence Directory &#8212; an online repository of       research and evaluation,       includes CAC projects.
Dr Caulfield served as an advisor on the AA       Evidence Advisory Group from       April 2011-December 2012, consulting on collating, enhancing, reviewing,       and disseminating the       evidence base for the Arts.
A measure of the impact of the research is gauged by its promotion in a       range of professional       and academic arenas.
For example, Caulfield was invited to present       findings relating to a 2008       evaluation of Gamelan music projects (Funded by the Firebird Trust) at the       AA launch conferences in       2009 and a subsequent AA conference in 2010, which attracted an audience       of government and prison       service officials, as well as Arts practitioners and others.
In 2011 the research was identified in Research Councils UK Big Ideas         for the Future report, a       publicly available document outlining 100 examples of excellent research       from all fields including       science, engineering, social sciences, medicine and the arts and       humanities.
The report focused on       research taking place in 2011 and explored what it might mean in 20 years'       time.This demonstrates not       only impact of reach and significance in the assessment period but       validates this strand of our research       as a foundation upon which to generate future impact.
Dr Caulfield's 2011 evaluation of the Artist in Residence at HMP Grendon,       commissioned by the       Marie-Louise von Motesiczky (MVLM) Charitable Trust, resulted in the       residency being extended for a       further two years (2012 and 2013), demonstrating effects on and benefits       to practice within the prison       and benefits to opportunities available to HMP Grendon prisoners.
The       Chair of the MLVM Charitable       Trust has stated, "The evaluation demonstrated the impact of the artist         in residence programme to date.
This in turn was the basis for the MLVM Charitable Trust's decision to         fund the programme for a further         two year phase".
The recreational art group built around the Artist       in Residence currently has places for       15 prisoners and resulted in 107 entries being made to the Koestler Trust       Exhibition in 2013 &#8212; the       highest number of entries from the prison in its history.
Of note, the       work of the artist and the prisoners       with whom she worked will be exhibited at the offices of the Guardian in       March 2014.
In addition, outcomes measures for prison-based arts programmes developed       by CAC were       cited as an example of good practice by CLINKS and the Charities       Evaluation Service in their publicly       available guidance report entitled Demonstrating the Value of Arts in         Criminal Justice (Ellis &amp; Gregory,       2011), This report directly addressed concerns by NOMS that the Arts       should aim to collect robust       evidence.
The inclusion of CAC research in the report demonstrates reach       amongst third sector       organisations and significance in terms of influence upon the practice of       outcomes measurement in       prison-based arts activities.
