     BEREC and its associated office are responsible for reviewing regulatory       decision-making on       telecoms markets across all 28 EU member states.
The research [1] was       published by The EU       Commission, and included the specific contribution of Boeger and Corkin       with associated       recommendations for reform (under its own name, although Boeger and Corkin       are named as co-       authors on a separate page), formally adopting it as a Commission Working       Document on 23 April       2013 ([a]).
It has directly impacted on the ways in which BEREC and its       office use the Article 7/7a       Procedure in the following ways: substantial reform of BEREC and its       Office's working methods;       dialogue shaping across the EU Commission, European Parliament, and Member       States;       influenced an EU Parliament report; and has been the driver of       inter-institutional pressure on       BEREC and its office.
In summary, the research kick-started and directly       shaped the substantial       changes to BEREC and its office both now and in the future, and is the key       reference point.
Boeger has facilitated this impact through workshops.
For example, on 8       October 2012, the       Commission held an open workshop in Brussels where Boeger presented the       report (alongside       some of the other authors) to members of industry and their representative       association, national       telecoms regulators and representatives of the BEREC Office, including its       Administrative Manager       (who commended the quality of Boeger and Corkin's analysis, [f]).
Senior       representatives of       several national telecoms regulators also offered highly positive feedback       ([i], [j]).
On 21 June       2013, Boeger co-organised a workshop attended by the key stakeholders in       telecommunciations       regulation &#8212; EU and national regulators themselves, MEPs, EU commission       members &#8212; at which       there was a further drive to progress and discuss the reforms.
Substantial Reform of BEREC and its Office       BEREC and the BEREC Office are committed to implementing Boeger and       Corkin's evaluation and       associated recommendations.
BEREC had already initiated several actions to       improve aspects of       the Article 7/7a procedure before the evaluation report was completed in       2012, but its published       work programme for 2013 commits it formally to consider the report's       recommendations in this       internal review, describing the two processes as `closely linked' ([d], p.       20).
The Head of       International Policy, AGCOM, and Chair of the BEREC `Framework       implementation' working group,       responsible for overseeing the internal review, wrote ([i]):     The `BEREC Evaluation Report is certainly a very useful reference tool         that we are         considering, within the [working group], for our ongoing work of         reviewing the [BEREC rules         of procedure], as well as any other internal guidelines and working         methods (especially as         far as art.7-7a procedure is concerned)'.
The review is ongoing but BEREC has already implemented far-reaching       improvements.
The       BEREC Office in particular has put in place (with further progress       ongoing) comprehensive       changes to its working methods under Article 7/7a.
Describing the       evaluation report as a `motivator'       in the process ([f]), the Administrative Manager of the BEREC Office       discussed the following       changes at the workshop organised by Boeger and Corkin on 21 June 2013:       Extending time limits       for national regulators to comment on BEREC draft opinions; Developing       templates for BEREC       opinions; Monitoring notifications of regulatory measures and potential       early-warning "alerts";       Maintaining a register of regulatory experts and rapporteurs; Regular       assessment reports about the       work of Article 7/7a working groups; Committing national telecoms       regulators to give the Article       7/7a procedure high priority; Clarification of definitions and detailed       procedure for BEREC and its       Office under Article 7/7a (including the role of rapporteurs); Improving       language and translation       support; Facilitating cooperation and tripartite meetings.
Some of the recommendations have directly prompted calls to tackle the       shortcomings BEREC has       so far been unable to address.
The Head of International Policy at Ofcom       and Chair of the BEREC       `Evaluation' offers perhaps the most comprehensive assessment of the       far-reaching significance of       Boeger and Corkin's research in both the intra-and inter-institutional       context ([j]):     `I think the Article 7/7a case study in the BEREC evaluation report         will come to be seen as         a very important contribution to the (ongoing) debate over the         appropriate institutional         arrangements in Europe, in the telecoms sector.
It was enormously useful         to have a         professional, independent and dispassionate account of how the Article         7/7a process has         worked in its first 18 months (warts and all).
On the one hand, it         offered welcome validation         and recognition of the real efforts that have been made by NRAs, BEREC         and the BEREC         Office, to make the system work.
I expect this will spur our continued         commitment going         forward.
On the other hand, the even-handed but frank (constructive)         criticism in the case         study should also serve to prevent any of the actors involved from         becoming complacent,         and the recommendations provide useful orientation on where and how we         should deploy         our resources.'
Dialogue shaping       The Commission is compelled to commission/produce this evaluation report       pursuant to EU       legislation.
It is designed specifically to frame directly the published       inter-institutional discussions,       consultations and negotiations between the Commission, the European       Parliament and the       Member States (including ministries and telecoms regulators) in preparing       the next review of the       EU telecoms framework (five EU Directives and one EU Regulation).
In this       context, the document       co-produced by Boeger and Corkin has acted as the primary point of       reference for all their       subsequent communications on the subject in a number of crucial respects.
The European Parliament is compelled by law to respond publicly to the       Commission by       commenting on the report (a plenary vote is scheduled for 12 Dec 2013).
Therefore, their       recommendations directly shape this published inter-institutional dialogue       leading, eventually, to       the Commission's call-for-input for the next review (which is expected       sometime in 2014).
Exploiting their research fully as a platform to generate wider       inter-institutional exchanges, Boeger       and Corkin's stakeholder workshop brought together academic experts       alongside senior policy       players in the formal process, including from the European Parliament, the       Commission, national       telecoms regulators and senior industry representatives, to exchange views       on the institutional       arrangements discussed in their study.
At the workshop, Mr Sed&#243; I Alabart       MEP, Rapporteur on       the Opinion dossier, remarked ([h]): `We have already analysed the         Evaluation....
In our first         reading of the Evaluation, we can agree on the major topics.
... [W]e         can use this Evaluation to         discuss the future of BEREC or a regulatory authority.'
Direct influence on EU Parliament draft report       The evaluation has directly and significantly influenced a simultaneous       parliamentary draft report       evaluating the implementation of the entire EU telecoms framework.
This       report proposes that the       conclusions reached by the research of Boeger and Corkin be addressed in       the forthcoming       framework review ([e], p. 5, pt.
4 (x)).
The evaluation ([k]):     `clearly helped us with [the draft] report....
It especially         allowed us to "get to the point" when         it came to raising difficulties related to the implementation of those         Telco Package's         provisions in which BEREC has a role, such as art 7/7a procedures.'
Inter-institutional pressure       The EU Commission is using Boeger's co-produced report to exert some       inter-institutional       pressure on BEREC and the BEREC Office to follow the line advocated by the       researchers in their       report.
The Commission's strategic positioning means that even greater       weight and visibility has       been given to the evaluation report.
The Commission has directly       incorporated the report into its       `thinking process' in its recent and potentially far-reaching initiative       on completing the single market       in telecoms.
Vice-President Kroes announced in Dec 2012 that she       considered the report as       `comprehensive and balanced.... a valuable input into our forthcoming         reflections on how to         deepen the internal market in this area.'
([b]) Mr Vesa Ter&#228;v&#228;, Head       of Unit at DG CONNECT ([g]):     `Regarding Art 7/7a case study [produced by Boeger and Corkin] it was         our assessment         (and I believe BEREC share this) that the study was sound and thorough         and provided a         very useful tool for assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of the         BEREC platform to         achieving its requirements and objectives.
... With regard to the single         market initiative...         [t]he evaluation report has played an important role in our thinking         process.'
BEREC and the Office have argued their position is broadly compliant with       the approach in the       report, as part of their negotiating position with the Commission ([c],       pp.
3-4; [f]), again       demonstrating the report's strategic significance.
