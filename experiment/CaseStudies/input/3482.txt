     Social and cultural impact.
The project's research led to two       touring exhibitions `South Asians Making Britain' (UK-tour 2010-12) and       `Beyond the Frame: India in Britain' (India-tour 2011-12).
These       exhibitions with outreach activities and online learning resources have       helped to re-frame public and political perception in the UK and India of       South Asian contributions to British life and culture before the Second       World War.
Both were built on successful collaborations with major       organisations (the British Council (India), the British Museum, the       National Archives of India, the South Bank Centre (London), and the       Victoria and Albert Museum), and attracted large audiences, as well as       extensive interest from the media and policy-makers.
The UK exhibition tour was premiered at `Bharat Britain' (British Library       conference 2010; 250 delegates).
It visited 11 public libraries, 2010-12       (1-2 months/venue, coordinated by British Library): Barking, Birmingham,       Bradford, Brighton, Croydon, Leicester, Manningham, Middlesbrough,       Southall, Swiss Cottage, and Woking (11,000 visitors).
The impact       on equality and citizenship issues was reflected in visitor responses.
Some highlighted how `all peoples' have `played their part in shaping       history' (Manningham, 10/2011); others stressed how the `legacy' of Asian       Britain should promote `mutual respect and understanding' (visitor book,       Southall 09/2012).
Indian ayah images prompted actress Meera Syal to       consider their stories for a play (BL 2010).
Recognition of the importance       of this new angle on British history encouraged other display requests:       DSC South Asian Literature Festival (600 visitors, 10/2010); Asia House       (300 visitors, 05/2012); and Humboldt University, Berlin (January &#8212; March       2012).
Following the success of the UK exhibition tour, the India exhibition       tour was proposed following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding       in Delhi between the UK and Indian governments (07/2010).
The British       Council (BC) requested a preview for arts, education and culture leaders,       and after meetings between the BC, OU, the BL and the National Archives of       India (NAI), the BC proposed co-ordinating an India-wide tour.
The impact       of the eight-city Indian exhibition tour (November &#8212; February 2011-12,       with 6325 visitors) was enhanced by the many dialogues it provoked across       numerous constituencies (arts and culture events, school workshops with       more than 450 children).
The project materials deepened impact, stimulating wide media coverage       (20 articles, including major newspapers, Times of India, The         Hindu, Indian Express, Mint, DNA, Pioneer,       Calcutta Telegraph, Week) [5.5].
The display and       accompanying events influenced cultural programming (BC, NAI), sparking       curriculum debate about `new ways of interpreting history' through       examining `Indian history in Britain' instead of `studying British history       in India' (Feedback forms 22/02/2012).
School workshops (15-18 year-olds)       were linked to BC's `Connecting Classrooms' scheme; NAI held a Delhi       launch (11/2011), coordinating a separate museum-led tour to their       Puducherry, Bhopal and Jaipur archive-centres (August - September 2012)       with outreach modeled on the OU/BL materials (600 participants).
The project supported by PR consultants achieved wide media coverage and       provoked further cultural interest.
The `Bharat Britain' conference led to       a BBC broadcast on poets Tagore and Naidu (Radio 4, 7/11/2010).
The UK       exhibition prompted the image-based timeline, `South Asians Making       Britain' (09/2010) for Guardian Online on front and world news       webpages (13,603 visits/month September &#8212; December 2010).
BBC Three       Counties Radio covered the OU exhibition launch (2012).
High profile       national institutions (Southbank Centre, `Asian Bloomsbury', 07/2012 and       Asia House, `Radical South Asians', 10/2012) extended understanding (Fiction         Uncovered podcast/Winkball          http://www.winkball.com/walls/9pYhqlsIsbhS/london-literature-festival-day-two-         southbank).
Knowledge transfer and exchange.
Curatorial, academic and       pedagogic collaborations with Indian and British stakeholders in the arts,       cultural and museum sectors resulted in innovative international       programming, showcasing UK humanities research through jointly-created       materials, including entries on Asians in British History on the BL's       award-winning interactive online timeline (5500 unique visits/month; http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/timeline/accessvers/index.html).
A new Asians in Britain learning website [5.2] coinciding with the India       tour (11/2011) attracted 15,445 individual page views by 09/2012.
This       cross-institutional engagement widened participation consolidating the       AHRC/BL India strategies [5.3, 5.4].
Hasan (Director, NAI) observed       `Important cross-sector exchange has been established' (Delhi, 11/2011).
Jensen (BL Head of Arts and Humanities) noted: `how much more can be       achieved when academics and library staff pool knowledge and expertise and       share their network of contacts.
This partnership has opened an important       aspect of history to... the wider public, and provided invaluable       opportunities for knowledge exchange between the OU and BL.
Feedback from       the UK, India and the Foreign Office suggests... this project has       contributed significantly to community cohesion and cultural diplomacy'       (10/2012).
Further online knowledge transfer has been ensured via the `Making       Britain' database (www.open.ac.uk/makingbritain),       which hosts publicity materials, blogs and websites promoting this       interactive freely-available resource (launched 2010).
From 1864 unique       visits/month (10/2011) to 11,389 (03/2013), traffic continues at       5,000-12,000 visits/month.
Figures (03/2013) show that attention from UK       (3735), India (3273) and the USA (1757) dominates, but it has attracted       users from more than 46 countries.

Political impact.
The strong OU/BL partnership generated wider       political interest.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in London       hosted the exhibition (November - December 2011), inviting the team to       lead a FCO seminar on cultural diplomacy, thus recognising the project's       significance to UK/India understanding.
FCO analyst (Velmati) marked its       relevance for Britain's diasporic communities; Wadvani, Deputy High       Commissioner, Kolkata suggested the website/database be `required reading       for anyone joining the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's South Asia team'       (2011).
