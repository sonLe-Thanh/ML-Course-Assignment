     The major impact is that this model has enabled policy makers         and practitioners, including       teachers (all of whom have obligations as UNCRC duty bearers), to implement         children's right to         participate in decision-making more effectively by providing a       legally-sound but user-friendly       model of understanding Article 12 which has improved understanding and       facilitated and promoted       implementation.
Impact on children, young people and teachers     The model has been used to teach children and young people in Northern       Ireland about their rights       under Article 12, through its inclusion in the core Key Stage 3 (KS3)       curriculum text for `Learning       for Life and Work' &#8212; a statutory area of learning in the Northern Ireland       Curriculum (C).
The       incorporation into the core KS3 curriculum in Northern Ireland since 2008       means that it will have       impacted upon up to 325,000 children and young people, based in 216       post-primary school       settings.
The accessibility of the model is further evidenced by the fact       that it has been used widely       by NGOs and other educators to inform adults and children about Article       12.
For example,       Playboard, Northern Ireland's leading play agency, has reproduced it         in full in its Play Quest         brochure [A], which advises the play and leisure sector on       children's participation in decision-making.
It is also used extensively by staff in other Higher Education       Institutions in its training of       teachers, lawyers and other childhood professionals and has, for example,       been identified as       "pivotal" in the Oxford Bibliography of Childhood Studies [B].
The       model has been adopted by a       range of training organisations, including for example the SiS Catalyst       project that trains science       educators across Europe [F].
Impact on Policy     Within Northern Ireland, the research has had a significant impact       on the work of the Children's         Commissioner's office.
The research, described by NICCY as a "significant         milestone in         children's rights in Northern Ireland" (http://www.niccy.org/article.aspx?menuid=11865)       was       used to determine the initial priorities for the Commissioner's office.
These included a core priority       around children's participation in decision-making, with education       identified as a particular area of       concern.
Moreover, one of NICCY's core roles is to advise government on       the fulfilment of their       obligations under the UNCRC.
As part of this, it has distributed it in policy         briefings to all         government departments, in a paper called "Having a Say" which       outlines and recommends       Lundy's 2007 participation model as a means of understanding and       implementing Article 12.
See       (http://www.niccy.org/Makeitright/childrenhavingasay/)       ([G], [H]).
It has also used the model       extensively in its training of public officials in relation to Article 12.
NICCY's participation officer [D]       has confirmed this as follows: "we have referenced your model in         various training programmes         including with social workers, health professionals and teachers to get         them to consider various         case studies and whether they are truly implementing Article 12.
It has         been a great help at getting         people to understand the indivisibility of rights and they need to         understand the CRC in its entirety         rather than individual articles, which are often summarised in one line         that fails to explain the         nuances of each individual article.
Most recently we have used your         article with our own         participation awards panel [who provide awards to public officials       for effective participation] to help         them articulate various models of participation."
Within the Republic of Ireland, the model is used by the Irish Ombudsman       for Children, Emily       Logan, to explain and promote the obligations in Article 12 to those who       work with children [E].
It       has also been selected by the Irish Minister for Children and Young People       to underpin the Irish       National Strategy on Children's Participation (to be implemented in 2013).
This promotes       compliance with the UNCRC in the Republic of Ireland as part of the       National Children's Strategy.
Anne O Donnell, Head of Policy and Citizenship Participation in the       Ministry identified the reasons       for selecting the model over other international participation models as       follows: "Lundy's model has         been identified as the most appropriate to underpin the policy because         it uses a rights based         approach to involving children in decision-making and is         non-hierarchical, in that it does place any         one form of participation above or below another.
The model is         accessible and user friendly in that         it translates complex children's rights principles, such as the         interdependence and interrelated         nature of a number of rights, into a succinct model which assists policy         makers in clearly         understanding and articulating their obligations under the UNCRC" [I].
Professor Lundy has been       appointed to the panel that will advise on and oversee the implementation       of the strategy.
