     [Numbers in square brackets refer to evidence in Section 5].
The Imp-Act research between 1999 and 2005 has had a major impact       on policy and practice across the microfinance industry, notably in terms       of the ideas, frameworks and tools which the industry uses.
This has had       significant consequences for millions of poor people globally.
The research changed mind sets [5.5, penultimate paragraph;         5.8].
In particular, it was key to developing the idea of `double bottom         line' (i.e.
social as well as financial) performance management of MFIs         &#8212; Copestake (2003) being the first published reference to the idea of         social performance in this field [3.3].
This in turn shifted the         emphasis away from ad hoc impact assessment studies controlled         and dominated by international donors, towards practices that MFIs         themselves could implement and benefit from directly.
The research had an immediate impact on how MFIs in Imp-Act         undertook social performance assessment and management: including         their design and use of tools for poverty assessment and social audit         [5.5, 5.6, 5.7].
An independent evaluation lauded the high quality of         the materials produced from the research, reporting that Imp-Act         was "really entering new territories and was innovative" and has         "changed the industry" [5.2, p55; 5.3].
The research played an "effective role in setting the agenda of           the Social Performance Task Force" [5.2, p55].
The SPTF is an         industry-wide body to which CGAP is affiliated, which in 2012 produced         the first "Universal Standards for Social Performance Management": a         joint policy statement for the sector by its leading actors.
Evidence of the growing adoption of social performance assessment,           beyond the MFIs who participated directly in Imp-Act,         comes from "MIX", the premier industry reporting body.
By 2010, 405 MFIs         with 44 million borrowers (including banks) reported the use of social         performance management techniques [5.1].
The majority of their clients         were women, [5.2] with the median MFI reporting 29% of members below a         US$2 per day poverty line [5.1].
This adoption of social performance         assessment demonstrates a deeper commitment on the part of MFIs, to         align their financial services to their social mission and to meet           poor people's needs [5.1].
This impact was achieved in three interconnected ways, involving       evidence, advocacy, persuasion and coalition-building.
First, from the outset the research was designed to be embedded within       the microfinance industry and to be `owned' by MFIs, as much as by the UK       academics coordinating Imp-Act, or the Ford Foundation funding it.
As the research diffused through the MFIs of the Imp-Act network,       they readily adopted the language, tools and practices that the research       promoted.
This transmission was reinforced by the findings Copestake and       Johnson published in practitioner journals and industry-oriented outlets,       such as the Small Enterprise Development journal [3.5], and       through other leading microfinance research and support organisations.
Evidence for this is to be found in supporting statements from senior       staff of CARD in the Philippines [5.7], the Microfinance Centre (MFC) in       Warsaw [5.6], SEEP, SPTF and Microfinance Initiatives in Washington DC       [5.5, 5.8] and MicroSave [5.9].
Second, the Imp-Act research led to the formation of the Imp-Act         Consortium in 2006.
This mainstreamed the uptake of social       performance management in microfinance through training and networking.
The Consortium drew heavily on Imp-Act research findings and       materials [5.1, 5.2]; therefore although not directly involved in the       training, Copestake and Johnson continued through their research findings       to have a significant impact on wider practice.
A key link resource was the Imp-Act Guidelines for social performance         management of microfinance, published in 2005 in French, Spanish and       Russian as well as English [5.4].
This included eight detailed Practice       Notes (http://www.imp-act.org/resources/publications/practice-notes),       six of which were drafted primarily by Copestake or Johnson.
The Imp-Act         Consortium subsequently incorporated all this material into A         Practice-Based Guide for Microfinance, aimed at "putting the social       into performance management".
This is now available in five languages,       with over 100,000 downloads:       http://www.imp-act.org/resources/publications/practice-guide.
Third, 2005 also saw the formation of the Social Performance Task Force       (SPTF).
This was an initiative of the Ford Foundation, CGAP and the       Argidius Foundation, with the aim of mainstreaming the ideas and practices       of Imp-Act at the global policy level.
By 2012, its membership had       grown to 700.
As its coordinator, Laura Foose, comments: "all of the         ideas, frameworks and tools that SPTF promotes can be traced back to the         Ford Foundation funded Imp-Act Programme that culminated in an         international conference on social performance in Bath in 2005 and the         book `Money with a Mission'.
James Copestake and Susan Johnson both         played leading roles in the conception, implementation and influence of         the Imp-Act Programme and hence the idea of social performance         management in microfinance."
