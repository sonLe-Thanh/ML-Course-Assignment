     The research benefited learners and teachers in secondary level and adult       continuing education; activities building upon the research brought       economic benefits to museums in the USA, and changed the way in which       Pompeian social life was perceived by children and the general public.
Impact on Education     Cooley's research (2003) and (2004) has influenced the design and       delivery of Roman social history courses in schools, universities, and       Continuing Education departments.
GCSE: The sourcebook features on reading lists for GCSE courses Roman         Life and Latin offered by OCR, and the Welsh Joint Education Committee         (WJEC)'s Level 2 certificate in Roman Civilisation.
According to OCR,         from 2008 to 2013 there were 10,621 AS Level entries, and 10,244 A Level         entries both of which use the sourcebook.
It is recommended in the         Teacher Resource Pack for GCSE Classical Civilisation (4020) Unit 3         offered by AQA (1263 students June 2011; 1579 June 2012) and for OCR         GCSE Classical Civilisation (J280; 18,913 entries 2008-13).
AS level: The sourcebook formed the basis for the OCR AS unit 6 for         Classical Civilisation `City Life in Roman Italy' (entry code F386)         designed in 2008.
Using the sourcebook, the course developer compensated         for the previous over-emphasis on elite houses and villas, adjusting the         course towards a `more rounded view of life in Pompeii, in full         confidence that students and teachers would have easy access to the         relevant texts and building plans, and to very helpful contextual         commentary which would guide them in using and interpreting the         material....For example, part of the reason that the temple of Isis now         appears on the list of prescribed material is because the building         itself, its dedicatory inscription and the dedications from within the         precinct were all presented in detail in the sourcebook.'
The course         designer also `took the opportunity to embed explicit references to the         sourcebook into the existing prescribed materials, and selected new         items partly on the basis of their coverage in the sourcebook.'
The         sourcebook is the main resource for inscriptions in the unit (12 out of         15) and is prescribed reading for the building and tomb of Eumachia, the         tomb of Munatius Faustus and Naevoleia Tyche, the Amphitheatre, the         Painting of the amphitheatre riot, and the Temple of Isis.
Higher School Certificate: in New South Wales, Australia, Stage 6         (ages 17-18): since 2005, Cooley's books have supported the Ancient         History core unit `The Cities of Vesuvius - Pompeii and Herculaneum'.
Topics supported by the sourcebook include the archaeological and         historical methods used to investigate the site (ch.
1-3); the city plan         and streetscape; how to use archaeological evidence to learn about the         social hierarchy and local political life (ch.
6); and the architectural         features and uses of public buildings (sourcebook and textbook).
In the         annotated resource list, Cooley (2003) is considered `An excellent         reference particularly on new research and interpretations over time.
Political influences and volcanology dealt with well.
Very good for         Section 3 of the syllabus.'
The sourcebook was described as having an         `Excellent section of primary sources for a wide range of aspects of         Pompeian life.'
(both p. 70)        Continuing Education courses: the sourcebook formed the basis for         online Continuing Education courses at the University of Oxford (twice         yearly since 2009, enrolment typically 15- 20) and Royal Holloway,         University of London (since 2007, enrolment 3-4 annually).
According to         Jo Berry, former course coordinator for `Pompeii and the Cities of the         Roman World':         `The Oxford course was completely designed around your sourcebook...[it]         helped to keep the students grounded in the evidence...I really felt         that by the end of each course the students were better at using         evidence to explain or justify their answers to questions.'
Other educational activities include writing an article `Social climbers       at Herculaneum' for the magazine Omnibus (2013), produced by the       Joint Association of Classics Teachers (JACT).
Targeted at sixth-formers       interested in the Classical World, this magazine has a circulation of       1,500-1,600 per issue.
Cooley has delivered talks to students taking       subjects in Roman social history at Abingdon College (09.2010, 30       audience); Bancroft's Classical Society (03.2012, 20 audience); to the       general public at `Pompeii: Excavations Past and Present', Dept.
of       Continuing Education, Oxford University (02.2008; 118 audience); and to       teachers at an OCR Inset day, British Museum (04.2013, 100+ audience).
98%       of the audience said that the lecture made them think about the       inscriptions in a new way (`Inscriptions are something I normally shy away       from so the lecture was fascinating and I hadn't even considered wax       tablets!
'), and the same number said that the lecture would enhance their       visit to the exhibition.
Impact on museum visitors     Cooley was invited by the multi-national company Acoustiguide to       contribute to the audio-guide for the exhibition `A day in Pompeii'       organised by the Soprintendenza Speciale per i Beni Archeologici di         Napoli e Pompei, and offered her expertise, speaking on 11 of the 26       stops on the guide (nos.
102, 104, 106, 112, 116, 118-22, 124), presenting       information on the city's social, cultural and economic composition, Roman       gods and goddesses, frescoes, furniture, and jewellery.
Cooley was one of       four international academic experts who appear on the English guide for       adults.
It toured 8 cities in the USA (2007-8; 2011-13) where the audio       guide was used:            The Gulf Coast Exploreum Center, Mobile, Alabama (Mar-Jun 2007;         134,790 visitors)       The Science Museum of Minnesota, Minneapolis-St. Paul (Jun 2007-Jan         2008; 297,883 visitors)       Discovery Place, Charlotte, NC (Jul 2008-Jan 2009; 122,818 visitors)       San Diego Natural History Museum (Feb-Jun 2008; 131,000 visitors).
Discovery Times Square, New York (Mar-Sep 2011)       Museum of Science, Boston (Oct 2011-Feb 2012; 250,000 visitors)       Cincinnati Museum Center (Mar-Aug 2012; 132,000 visitors)       Denver Museum of Nature and Science (Sep 2012-Jan 2013; 171,980         visitors).
At museums where the audio guide was rented separately, it made       considerable contributions to the institution's revenue from the       exhibition.
For example, at Discovery Times Square, 39,375 audio-guides       were rented at $7 each (total $275,625).
The audio-guides were available       to rent at $2 for adults and $1 for children at Discovery Place Charlotte,       contributing to the $8 million economic impact the exhibition created for       the region.
The audio-guides were offered free to all exhibition visitors       at the Science Museum of Minnesota and the San Diego Natural History       Museum.
In all instances, the audio-guide added value to the visitor       experience: it contextualised the exhibition in current academic research       presented in a manner accessible to non-experts, giving visitors a richer       and more nuanced understanding of the objects on display, and made for a       more enjoyable visit.
The impact's reach is demonstrated by the nearly 1       million exhibition visitors who had access to academic research on       Pompeii.
Impact on children's publishing     Cooley was invited by the children's book publishers Scholastic to act as       historical advisor for My Story, Pompeii, part of a popular series       for 9-11 year olds.
Her report to Scholastic provided the correct date of       the eruption of Vesuvius, corrected names, topography, and archaeological       details which stem from her research on Pompeii's archaeological history.
As a result, the author Sue Reid changed several of the characters' names       to suit their family and social situations and employed the new date of       the eruption.
A historical note at the end of the novel explains that       recent research has re-dated the eruption.
Since publication in 2008,       Scholastic has 15,000 books in print and in the market in the UK and a       further 10,000 in print and in the market in Australia and New Zealand.
Media Consultancy     Cooley was contacted by two media outlets developing television       programmes about Roman social history.
She was consulted by an associate       producer from Associated Producers (Toronto, Canada) who produced the       series `Secrets of Christianity (Decoding the Ancients)', which aired in       the US (History Channel, 2010), Canada (History Television, 2011), and 9       other countries (2011) .
Her research about the `inscriptions in Pompeii       that indicate a Jewish presence' fed into episode 3, `Vesuvius and the       Fear of God'.
Cooley was also interviewed by telephone by a       producer-director at Lion Television for the series `Meet the Romans'       (BBC2, April 2012).
She was asked for input into `how we could use       funerary monuments and other epigraphic evidence to let us into different       areas of the social history of Ancient Rome'.
Viewing figures for the       programme were 1.97 million (w/e 22 April), 1.8 million (w/e 29 April) and       2.9 million (w/e 6 May).
Public Impact     Cooley has communicated her research to non-academic audiences: her web       article for Warwick's Knowledge Centre (June 2013; 154 unique page views)       reviewed the British Museum exhibition, `Life and Death at Pompeii and       Herculaneum' (Summer 2013).
She has given talks to Classical Association       branches at Roehampton and South-West London (03.2013; 20 audience) and       Southampton (05.2009, 20 audience); Three Counties Ancient History Society       (Upton Snodsbury, 04.2008 and 04.2011, 20 audience); and to Friends of       Alcester Museum (10.2012, 40 audience).
Further evidence of the research's reach and significance is demonstrated       by the number of copies sold: Pompeii (2003) has sold 451 copies (figures       from 2009) and the sourcebook 7562 (pbk), 195 (hbk) and 312 (e-book)       copies worldwide during the assessment period.
Its popularity has prompted       the publisher to commission a second edition (2013c), which includes       recent finds from Pompeii and source material from Herculaneum.
The       textbook was featured in The Times Book Club (17.4.2010).
It is       recommended by the company Andante Travels for tourists on their Campanian       tour (http://bit.ly/15v18xT).
