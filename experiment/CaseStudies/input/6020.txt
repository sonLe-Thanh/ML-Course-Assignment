     Our social practice approach to evaluation had impact in four major       areas.
First, it has had a major impact on the ways in which policy makers       understand the relations between policies and day to day practices.
Second, it enabled them to improve the management of a national policy       initiative aimed at enhancing quality across Scottish higher education.
Third, our approach to evaluation led to changes in quality practices in       Scottish universities and in some cases had a direct impact on the       development of their educational provision.
In fact our evaluative       approach was so integral to the success of the QEF that one Scottish       Pro-Vice Chancellor said "I have often referred to it as the sixth element       of the Scottish Quality Enhancement Framework".
Finally, our approach to       evaluation has had global reach in the way that it has influenced       international debates about the development of socially just approaches to       evaluation.
1) Changing policy makers conceptions of how policies impact on         practices     "We took up and ran with your model of culture change [set out in       Saunders, M. et al., 2011] through explicit work on developing and         supporting quality cultures and we still conceptualise the model of         institutional development in terms of systems of both shared practice         and shared values" (Head of the QAA Scotland).
Through our evaluative research reports and our frequent discussions with       higher education policy makers in Scotland, our evaluation helped policy       makers to reconceptualise the relations between policies and practices.
For example, in June 2012, the head of the QAA Scotland told us that our       analytical frameworks:            provided them with a model of cultural change which they have used to         conceptualise institutional development in terms of systems of shared         practices and values;       this model helped them to develop and support quality cultures across         the higher education sector;       resulted in them thinking about measuring impact by examining the         alignment between policies and practices at the levels of senior         management, middle management and teaching and learning interactions         rather than by examining the level of awareness these groups had of         individual policies;       helped them to develop collective models for defining and measuring         impact in this way;       allowed them to conceptualise the way in which they can embed a         quality culture.
2) Improving the management of national teaching and learning policy         initiatives       The Lancaster University evaluations "provided valuable insights         into the operation of the [Enhancement] Themes which QAA Scotland         officers were able to use to adopt a revised approach to managing this         area of activity" and informed "a change in emphasis in the way in which         the individual Themes are managed" (Scottish QAA 2012 report on       quality assurance and enhancement in the university sector).
Our evaluation reports and discussions with policy makers in Scotland       have led to an improvement in the ways in which national teaching and       learning policy initiatives are managed.
We provided high quality       information for policy makers that helped them to adjust aspects of policy       implementation in order to make it more effective.
Reports written by       policy makers in Scotland and statements from these policy makers show       that our valuation led to the following improvements in the QEF:            our concepts offered a powerful focus for the development of         enhancement indicators resulting in a new framework;       a change in the approach to managing the operation of the enhancement         themes and a change in emphasis in the way that individual themes were         managed which was more responsive to institutional pressures and         circumstances;       based on our evidence the external institutional reviews were revised         to be less like a QA audit and more of a fully enhancement-led approach         (by re-emphasising supportive and collegiate approaches);       the enhancement themes were developed to become longer in duration and         to include the requirement to set up cross-disciplinary teams within         each institution;       our reports were instrumental in the redrafting of the Scottish Higher         Education Enhancement Committee terms of reference;       our reports played an important role in Student Participation in         Quality Scotland's (SPARQs) development of their approach to student         engagement in quality enhancement processes by analysing and presenting         good practice.
3) Influencing practices at an institutional level       The evaluations "helped frame our developments over a particularly         challenging period when we were engaged with a major project to merge.
I         think it would be fair to claim that this work therefore had a direct         input to the re-development of our provision".
(Senior lecturer at       the University of the West of Scotland)     Through our reports and the on-going discussions with individual higher       educational institutions, we had a direct influence on the practices of       staff and thus the students in Scottish universities.
Statements from       staff in Scottish universities and national reports on enhancement       activities indicate that our evaluation:            made an important contribution to the development of a Scottish         approach to quality;       helped institutions to develop a notion of a quality framework;       was crucial in developing a change-focused approach to enhancement at         the institutional level;       had a direct impact on the ways in which some institutions approached         the internal evaluation of their educational innovations;       had a direct input into the ways in which some institutions developed         their educational provision;       led to the increased integration of students into institutional review         processes and the provision of examples of good practice for their         development.
4) Shaping international policy debates about how to develop useable and       socially just evaluation     "Your work [Saunders, M. 2011; 2012] fed into a new concept which       is reflected in the draft regulation for the 2014-2020 period, which is       aimed to be clearer on the different types of indicators used and the       differentiated roles of monitoring and evaluation... [It confirmed] that       we need to build up practice at different levels of European Governance       and seek to accumulate evidence across different contexts for the       different policy areas" (Head of Evaluation, Directorate General for     Regional Policy, European Commission)     Our approach to evaluation has had a major impact on international       debates on the development of inclusive evaluation practices.
The impact       of our social practice approach to evaluation internationally has       included:            the incorporation of our work on capturing the effects of policy         programmes and interventions into its guidance to all EU member states         for the evaluation of cohesion and integration fund expenditure;       the emphasis on evaluation practices (through the vice presidency of         the IOCE and the Executive Committee which manages EvalPartners) and the         co-design of the Chiang Mai Declaration on Civil Society Working In         Partnership For Better Evaluation, which was supported by UN agencies,         the OECD and evaluation societies from across the world         http://www.mymande.org/sites/default/files/Declaration_evalpartners_English.pdf         ;        the emphasis on evaluation practices in recent UNICEF publications         (e.g.
Bustelo, M. and Saunders, M. 2013) on Evaluation and Civil         Society, which are sponsored by organisations which include the World         Bank, OECD and UN Women.
