     The York research strongly affected the conclusions of international       reports on the impacts of       climate change.
In conjunction with the original research, these       influenced climate-related policy       development and actions by intergovernmental, governmental and       Non-Governmental       Organisations (NGOs) during 2008-13.
"York research on the         responsiveness of and risks to         biodiversity from climate change has pervaded public and political         thinking throughout the world.
There can be no doubt that this has thereby framed a major component of         the policy context within         which all national and international discussions, agreements, policies         and legislation have been         set", according to Guy Midgley, South Africa's lead for long term       climate change adaptation       planning, and negotiator for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change       (UNFCCC).
Contribution to policy-facing reports.
York research is prominent       among the evidence and       conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment       Reports (IPCC       AR4, 2007), which were marked by the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to       IPCC.
Specifically:            IPCC AR4 cites 24 publications by York biologists, and Thomas was an         expert reviewer.
York research allowed the IPCC to draw its main conclusions about the         impact of climate         change on terrestrial biodiversity: e.g.
Fitter &amp; Fitter (2002) is         cited as evidence for the earlier         timing of spring events (Working Group II, Section 1.3.5.1), and         Hickling et al.
(2006) as         evidence for latitudinal changes to the distributions of species (WGII,         Section 1.3.5.2).
IPCC lead-author Midgley states: "The IPCC's AR4 judgement that `In           terrestrial ecosystems,           earlier timing of spring events and poleward and upward shifts in           plant and animal ranges are           with very high confidence linked to recent warming' stems very           strongly from research carried           out at York.
Thomas and Hill studies constitute nearly three-quarters           of individual species range           shifts among terrestrial species reported in IPCC AR4 (WGII, Table           1.9), contributing more           cases of terrestrial distribution changes than any other research           group in the world."
This York-associated conclusion constitutes one of only five IPCC         assessments as having very         high confidence across all sectors of climatic change and impacts.
Midgley notes that "two of 18 key impacts of climate change listed           in the summary for           policymakers (Figure SPM.7) are (i) changes to the distributions of           species and (ii) extinction           risks to species; both based strongly on the research at York."
These IPCC reports engaged nearly all the world's nations, thousands         of NGOs, and thousands         of natural and social scientists, so the implications of York research         have been widely taken up         across diverse sectors.
The impact of the IPCC report and York research         are outlined below.
International action.
The York work as represented in these       reports has been heavily used by all       sectors of society in 2008-13 as a sound basis for the dissemination of       knowledge, formulation of       policies, and development of mitigation and adaptation activities.
For       example:            "IPCC AR4 reports, which were so strongly influenced by the York           work, have underpinned all           international climate change negotiations, policy making and           adaptation strategies from 2008           onwards" and "contributed to the development of national           policies in most countries in the world"         says Midgley, who also states that "concerns around biodiversity           impacts due to climate change           have been [a] critical influence on developing world           perceptions of risk, and [formulation of]         critical mitigation and adaptation responses", including in South         Africa.
Non-academic Australian and USA national and state environmental         reports include ~2000         citations to IPCC as well as direct citations to Hill and Thomas (e.g.
Department of Environment         Climate Change &amp; Water, New South Wales, Australia).
"In the US, the policy changes that have arisen directly and           indirectly because of [the York] work           include state and national centers for dealing with the biological           impacts of climate change",         states Lee Hannah, Senior Fellow at international NGO Conservation         International.
IPCC-reported York evidence contributed to global-scale initiatives         and policy development         through the UNFCCC and Conference of Parties (CoP).
These provide means         by which 195         member nations and ~30 international agencies seek agreement (e.g.
at         Copenhagen 2009 and         Doha 2012 congresses) on globally-integrated approaches to the         development of climate         change mitigation and adaptation strategies.
The need for agreement is         predicated on IPCC-         reported scientific evidence, which for biodiversity impacts stems from         the York research.
International NGOs draw on York work.
Hannah says that "Conservation           International and           numerous other NGOs have drawn on this work, both directly and         [through] AR4 reports, when           developing their positions at international climate change and           biodiversity congresses, such as           the UNFCCC" and that Thomas "has had a deep influence on the           IUCN [International Union for         the Conservation of Nature] red list process for climate change".
Jonathan Mawdsley, program director of the Heinz Center, highlighted         the link between         Thomas' research and UNFCCC communications, which led to the Convention         on Biological         Diversity deciding to convene a Technical Advisory Group "to channel           advice from convention           participants to the UNFCCC on...climate change and biodiversity"         (Mawdsley et al.
2012).
Thus,         York research influenced the decision to establish a process whereby         climate change and         biodiversity issues and advice from all nations are collated under the         aegis of UNFCCC.
Impact on UK and EU policy development.
UK and EU policies on       climate change have been       driven by the IPCC AR4 reports, and strongly reflect the York research on       biodiversity impacts.
UK policy-making.
The first report of the Committee on Climate         Change (2008, e.g.
p. 16), the         Climate Change Act 2008, the Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change         (DECC) 2009 Impact         Assessment, and a series of other DECC reports and statements, including         annual carbon         budget and emissions statements, all draw on the York-influenced IPCC         AR4 reports for         scientific evidence and as a motivation to develop mitigation and         adaptation strategies.
UK emissions targets.
Members of Parliament used concern for         biodiversity (i.e.
from York         research) in the UK Climate Change Act debate (Hansard 9/6/08) to argue         for 80% reduction of         greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (20% above the government-proposed         60%).
After debates         in the Commons and Lords and advice from the Committee on Climate Change         (mentioning the         limited adaptive capacity of biological systems), the 2050 target was         indeed set at an 80% cut.
The Climate Change Act (Nov 2008) made the UK unique in introducing "a           long-term legally           binding framework to tackle the dangers of climate change" (CCC         2013).
EU emissions targets.
The Council of the European Union's         adoption (6/4/09) of the climate         energy legislative package is "designed to achieve the EU's overall           environmental target of a           20% reduction in greenhouse gases ... by 2020".
Martin Horwood MP         stated that "The IPCC           fourth assessment report, quoted extensively in these [EU] documents,           paints the familiar           picture of potential species extinction..." (Hansard, 13/6/09).
This reveals how Thomas' scientific         insights about extinction have become `common understanding' within         relevant policy debates.
This legislative package is a framework for legislation in all EU member         and linked nations.
Impacts on conservation organisations and their policies.
York       research has directly or       indirectly affected policy development in virtually all       environmental/conservation NGOs,       government departments and agencies, and state and province agencies       throughout the world.
Defra, Natural Resources Wales, other UK agencies, and conservation         NGOs such as the         Royal Society for the Protection of Birds have developed new internal         structures and employed         staff both in climate change advocacy (mitigation) and practical         conservation roles (adaptation).
Their motivation is mainly the perceived risks and knowledge that         species are already         responding to climate change &#8212; both established for the UK by York         researchers.
Independently of IPCC, the Defra report "Conserving biodiversity in           a changing climate:           guidance on building capacity to adapt" (Hopkins et al.
2007) represents guidance that has         been in place for all UK government agencies and conservation NGOs in         2008-2013.
John         Hopkins, UK government conservation agency employee for over 30 years,         states that the         report "drew heavily upon [Thomas and Hill's] work, much more           so than any other authors" and         that "...there are few other academics who have been so successful           at producing policy           relevant world class publications ... and support[ing] policy           makers and practitioners."
Natural England has produced a "Terrestrial Biodiversity climate           change impacts Report Card           2012-13", with Thomas on the working group (its conclusions         underpinned by York research).
Natural England commissioned in 2012-13 assessment of the climate         change risks to over 3000         UK animal and plant species, using Thomas et al.
's (2011) risk         framework.
Direct references are made to Thomas' work as well as to IPCC by         globally-leading         organisations, including the International Union for the Conservation of         Nature, World Wide         Fund for Nature, Birdlife International, and Friends of the Earth.
Conservation International's         Lee Hannah states: "The understanding developed by York researchers           in recent years has ...           resulted in a marked redistribution of resources in this field,           including structuring of climate           change biology units within national and international NGOs, such as           Conservation           International.
Most NGOs now employ specialist climate change           researchers and policy makers,           as well as integrating the threat of climate change throughout their           organizations.
The insight           from the York research has therefore affected international NGO and           governmental thinking at           levels from line staff researchers to that of senior policymakers".
At intergovernmental level, the UN Collaborative Programme (involving         FAO, UNDP, UNEP) on         Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in         Developing Countries (UN         REDD+) involves 44 partner countries, spanning Africa, Asia-Pacific and         Latin America;         influenced by the York-realisation of the threats to biodiversity from         climate change.
Impacts on public discussion.
Primary reporting of York research       on television, newspapers,       radio and electronic media (~5000 reports) is estimated to have reached "millions         of people around         the world" (Pearson 2011), influencing legal cases (e.g.
expert       evidence by Thomas to two US       cases) and inspiring books on the subject.
The Smithsonian's Pearson wrote       a popular science       book on the ecological impacts of climate change that drew upon Thomas' "extensive         body of work... numerous times"; American journalist Kolbert       focussed on Thomas and his work in her       acclaimed "Field Notes from a Catastrophe: Man, Nature, and Climate         Change" (which received a       Heinz Award 2010 and Sierra Club Award 2011); and Hannah (2012)       extensively referenced       research by Thomas to provide "a clear explanation of the science       [of extinction risk] for         conservationists, researchers, teachers, students, and policy-makers."
Hence, York research has       contributed to wider discussions of the relationship between humanity and       the biosphere.
