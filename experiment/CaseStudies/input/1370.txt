     Impact on production: decisions by regulatory authorities have been         influenced       In December 2008, the GB Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) approved the       BioBullets product       Silver Bullets 1000 for use in public water supplies (ref 7).
A second       formulation suitable for very       large water volumes and carrying a different active ingredient (currently       confidential), Silver Bullets       2000, was approved in April 2011 (ref 8).
These approvals demonstrated the       environmental safety       of the products, and enabled them to be tested within operational drinking       water plants.
The       Environment Agency has also provided permits for discharge of Biobullets'       products into recipient       streams and rivers, with monitoring of riverine biota before and after       dosing trials repeatedly       showing the broken-down product to have no measurable impact on aquatic       biota (ref 9), and       regards "The biobullet formulation [as] an essential management tool in         our response to a variety         of priority invasive non-native species."
(ref 9).
Impact on production: costs of [drinking water] production have been         reduced       Eight full-scale trials have been conducted within the impact period in       seven UK waterworks,       belonging to Anglian Water (ref 10), South Staffordshire Water (ref 11),       Thames Water (ref 12),       Severn Trent Water and Welsh Water.
Dosing [text removed for publication]       has yielded highly       successful results, [text removed for publication].
Removal of mussels       from raw water pipes has       resulted in reduced pipe restrictions, with related savings on pumping       costs.
For example, a       representative of Anglian Water said: "There had been a significant         loss of performance at our         water treatment works in Covenham due to large numbers of zebra mussels         blocking the pipes         feeding the plant.
Use of BioBullets significantly reduced the number of         mussels, demonstrating a         cost effective solution to the problem" (ref 10).
The potential financial impact of BioBullets' products on the UK water       industry is significant.
For       example, Thames Water spent &#163;1m in 2010 clearing zebra mussels from their       raw water pipes (ref       12).
Anglian Water reported in 2011 that the increased pressure required       to pump water through       zebra mussel-infested pipes cost &#163;500K per annum in additional energy       costs (ref 12).
Following       trials of BioBullets, the companies stated:            "We believe BioBullets will save hundreds of thousands of pounds in           operational costs in a           way that has no adverse impact on the environment."
(ref 12).
We are very hopeful BioBullets are the solution we've been looking           for having trialed them           at our treatment works at Alton in Suffolk and Pitsford in           Northamptonshire.
In both cases           we saw a significant reduction in the numbers of mussels without any           impact on the           treatment process or the environment."
(ref 12).
BioBullets is currently negotiating commercial terms with a service       provider [text removed for       publication] to deliver the product across the UK water industry.
Impact on commerce: the performance of an existing business has been         improved       In June 2011, a dedicated manufacturing plant for BioBullets was opened in       Bristol [text removed       for publication].
The plant has an annual capacity of 5000 tonnes, [text       removed for publication].
International impact on commerce       Based on the original research conducted in Cambridge, tests and trials       have been carried out in       other countries.
Tests in the Netherlands (by [text removed for       publication], a major consultant to       the European and Asian power industries) yielded 100% mortality [text       removed for publication].
Trials funded by the Aragon government in Spain in February 2011 resulted       in a highly effective       removal of fouling zebra mussels and Asian clams (Corbicula spp.)
within irrigation systems:       "Infestation of irrigation systems by zebra mussels and Asian clams has         presented farmers with         problems in maintaining adequate water supplies to crops.
BioBullets was         able to remove         substantial volumes of mussels from the irrigation pipes."
(ref 13).
BioBullets is currently in       discussion with both the US and Spanish water industries about using their       products to control       zebra mussels in water supplies in those countries.
Building on the breadth of the initial patent, the company has       diversified its product range to target       a broad range of invasive aquatic species.
In 2006, BioBullets started       development and testing of a       formulation to control fouling by invasive bivalves (Mytilopsis and       Perna spp.)
in [text removed for       publication] shrimp farms.
In laboratory tests [text removed for       publication] one formulation yielded       100% mortality of mussels, but with no harmful effect on the shrimps.
Discussions are underway       between BioBullets and [text removed for publication] (two [text removed       for publication] shrimp       farming companies) for full-scale field trials.
In 2008 a grant to       BioBullets from the US National       Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (ref 14) enabled the       development and testing of       a formulation to control invasive seasquirts (Didemnum vexillum),       pests which threaten the global       marine aquaculture industry.
Trials of formulations in New Zealand in 2010       produced high       mortalities in both Didemnum, and a second invasive and       economically damaging seasquirt, Ciona         clava (ref 15).
The underpinning BioBullets technology has become a platform for       expansion of the company into       other areas.
A Feasibility Grant from the TSB in 2011 enabled development       [text removed for       publication] to enhance the growth rates and survival of commercial       shellfish larvae (ref 16).
[text       removed for publication] In January 2013, BioBullets led a consortium of       three SMEs (the others       being Micropore Technologies, UK, and Scalpro, Norway) in successfully       bidding for Eureka       Eurostars funding (an EU R&amp;D programme) to develop microencapsulated       feed products to       enhance commercial shellfish yields (ref 17).
The speed of juvenile       shellfish growth is currently       constrained by the availability of, and nutrient levels in, algal cells;       BioBullets' platform technology       enables them the encapsulation of tailored and optimised nutrient packages       for feeding to different       shellfish species.
Impact on the environment: the management of an environmental hazard         has changed       The adoption of Biobullets by UK water companies has changed how the       industry approaches       control of zebra mussels.
The products are reducing the use of chlorine in       water supplies, and so       reducing a major human and animal aquatic toxin: "Biobullet provides a         unique formulation that has         the potential to allow us to target a variety of invasive non-native         species in a manner that will         protect the rest of the ecology from non-target damage."
(ref 9).
