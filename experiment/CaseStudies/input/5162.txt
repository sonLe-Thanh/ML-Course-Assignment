     The research described has had a direct impact on the HIV-related       policies of both international organisations and national governments in       Africa.
Findings on knowledge and attitude change through education in       particular have been widely implemented.
UNESCO's 2009 International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education       drew heavily on the evidence from the Tanzanian and Zimbabwean trials and       the Steady.., Ready..., Go!
reviews, highlighting the MEMA kwa Vijana       results as `particularly interesting' while picking up on its caveat that       education and community-based programmes alone are not sufficient to bring       HIV incidence down.5.1 In 2010, comprehensive HIV knowledge       among 80% of young people was agreed as the first `bold result' of the       UNAIDS Business Case on Empowerment of Young People for HIV Prevention.
To help countries achieve this result, the UNAIDS Inter-Agency Task Team       on HIV and Young People agreed in 2011 to focus their efforts on sexuality       education in schools.
The two trials were influential in these global       policy moves.5.2 The new UNAIDS Strategy for 2011-2015 points       to the need for expanded provision of effective school-based sexuality       education.5.3     The MEMA kwa Vijana intervention materials were introduced into schools       in Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe in the early 2000s, and roll-out       continued between 2008-2013.5.3 The materials are approved for       use in primary schools in Tanzania, where they are published in Swahili,       and are freely available in both English and Swahili on the MEMA kwa       Vijana website.5.4 They were also the first HIV prevention       educational materials to be featured in the Global HIV Archive in 2012.5.5       Two reviews for UNESCO stressed the importance of these two trials and       specifically highlighted the MEMA kwa Vijana trial.
SIECUS (Sexuality       Information and Education Council of the United States), in its Global         Vision: Promising Resources From Around the World (2008) describes       MEMA kwa Vijana as `innovative' and highlights the features of its       training package.5.6 MEMA kwa Vijana's results were also       important evidence used for the WHO guidelines on preventing early       pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in developing       countries (2011),5.7 and the key UNICEF Opportunity in         Crisis document (2011) endorsed MEMA kwa Vijana and Regai Dzive       Shiri as `successful in changing attitudes'.5.8     Ministries of Health in Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya have accepted the two       programmes' joint policy recommendations that educational interventions       will need to be combined with both biomedical and structural measures to       change social and sexual norms.
Global health-related agencies such as       UNESCO, WHO, UNICEF and UNAIDS have also used the recommendations, with       UNICEF's Fourth Stocktaking Report on Children and HIV citing the       policy brief based on these projects.5.9     The results of the Steady.., Ready..., Go!
reviews have been used       extensively by policy-makers and programme implementers in international       agencies and governments to focus their priorities on `Go!'
and `Ready'       interventions &#8212; those that should be implemented forthwith without needing       further evidence, and those that should be implemented with careful       evaluation.5.2, 5.10 Senior UNICEF staff have quoted the       reviews to justify their priorities, including Geeta Rao Gupta, Deputy       Executive Director at the International AIDS Conference in July 2012.5.10       A 2012 LSHTM-UNICEF review of the national response to prevent HIV among       young people in 20 high-prevalence countries found that the programme with       the strongest evidence and thus designated as `Go!'
in the review &#8212;       in-school interventions that are adult-led and curriculum-based &#8212; was the       most widely-implemented youth prevention strategy across countries.5.10     Presentations of the research to policy-makers and health practitioners       have helped raise awareness and understanding of the research findings.
Ross presented findings from the MEMA kwa Vijana trial and the systematic       reviews at numerous UN and other meetings, including the Annual Meeting of       HIV Program Focal Points from Ministries of Education in Sub-Saharan       Africa, Dakar, Senegal, December 2008 (over 50 participants from 30       countries); and an expert consultation at the International Centre for       Research on Women, Washington DC, May 2011 (over 50 participants from       international organisations, funding agencies and governments).
Ross has also been influential as the Chair of the Technical Steering       Committee of the WHO's Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and       Adolescent Health,5.2 on the UNAIDS Monitoring and Evaluation       Reference Group, and as an academic lead on the new Lancet       Commission on Adolescent Health and Wellbeing.5.2     In July 2013, Ross and colleagues presented their latest review of global       evidence on the effectiveness of interventions for HIV prevention,       treatment and care to UNICEF (48 participants, including UNICEF staff,       government adolescent health focal persons, etc.)
and these have been used       as a central piece in UNICEF's new operational guidance on adolescents and       HIV.5.10
