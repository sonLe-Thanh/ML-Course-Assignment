     Levitas's early theoretical work on social exclusion published in 1996       [1], partly funded by the ESRC [7], has had a huge interdisciplinary       impact and has continued to be a key reference point (106 citations since       2008).
The concept of social exclusion had an increasingly high profile in       New Labour discourse from 1997 with the setting up of the Social Exclusion       Unit.
In the years after 2001, the terminology became more central to EU       discourse and social policy, with member states required to produce       National Inclusion Plans.
International attention to the potential (and       potentially different) meanings of inclusion was consequently high at this       time.
Levitas's impact was reflected in the very high number of citations       for The Inclusive Society?
(641 since 2008) [2]; in academic       invitations (including to Harvard in 2001); in invitations to speak to       non-academic groups, notably people working in local government; and in       invited contributions to professional journals, such as: `Calculated       Poverty', The Stakeholder, 5(6) (2002), pp.
12-13.
Levitas was       also invited to give an opening plenary address at the 2003 Social       Inclusion Research Conference, Canadian Council on Social Development,       Ottawa (www.ccsd.ca/events/inclusion/papers)       which was aimed at local and central government and practioners rather       than academics.
Subsequently, in 2005, Levitas was an invited participant       in Ottawa on the Expert Round Table on Social Inclusion of the Canadian       Department of Social Development.
The impact of the 1999 PSE, together with that of the PSE 2002-03       Northern Ireland Survey, has also been ongoing since 2000, including from       2008 onwards.
The PSE questionnaire was placed in the public domain, and       widely adapted for use elsewhere (including in Japan in a study published       in 2010) [e].
The public perception of necessities, key to the consensual       approach, varies between countries and the method has been introduced in       many countries across the world to apply nationally appropriate criteria.
The United Nations Expert Group on Poverty Measurement (Rio Group)       endorsed the PSE deprivation index construction methodology in 2006 as       `best practice' to guide national policy makers.
In 2011 the European       Union recommended it as the academic `gold standard' (7th       Meeting of the EU-SILC Task-Force on Material Deprivation, 19 March       2011, p. 7).
Its continuing influence is evident in poverty policy and       surveys in more than 50 countries worldwide today.
It has changed the way       that information about poverty is collected, measured and understood by       governments, academics and NGOs in most OECD countries, including all 27       European Union member states, Australia, Hong Kong, Iceland, Israel,       Japan, New Zealand, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Taiwan and Turkey.
Hence       the PSE has had global impact.
Levitas' collaborative research [4] is       cited in the European Commission's Eurostat Reports http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat       from 2007 through to the present day [d] funded by the European Commission       as part of its Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity.
The PSE       approach is also being promoted globally by the UN Dept of Economic and       Social Affairs: e.g.
2010 report [f].
The impact of the B-SEM, originally published in 2007 [6], is also       widespread, ongoing and global: a search produces 20,400 Google hits.
The       Cabinet Office's Social Exclusion Task Force commissioned four pieces of       work based on the B-SEM framework and addressing different stages of the       life-course.
Three were written by scholars at institutions other than       Bristol: these were published in 2009 [a] [b] [c].
The Bristol team, this       time with Fahmy as PI and Levitas and Gordon as CIs, carried out the       fourth study: Understanding the Risks of Social Exclusion Across the         Life-Course: Working Age Adults without Dependent Children, Social       Exclusion Task Force, Cabinet Office, 2009.
The approach taken in the       B-SEM was used extensively by the think-tank Demos in its attempt to       derive a broader, more multi-dimensional measure of poverty: see their 3D         Poverty (2010) http://www.demos.co.uk/files/3-D_Poverty_-_web.pdf.
This continues to be influential, such as in the joint work in 2013 of the       Family Strategic Partnership and Family and Parenting Institute which       explicitly frames its analysis in terms of the B-SEM and its adoption by       Demos (http://www.familystrategicpartner.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Policymakinglife_chances.pdf).
The       B-SEM features at the global, regional, national and local levels and in       diverse contexts.
To illustrate, it can be found at the global level in       the work of the World Health Organisation in 2008 [j]; at the regional       level in a 2012 EU report whose methodology follows `the seminal study of       Levitas et al.
(2007)' [i]; at the national level in the work of the       Australian government in 2008 [h]; and at the local level by the       Hertfordshire Safeguarding Children Board in 2011 (http://www.hertssafeguarding.org.uk).
It is used in diverse contexts: in commercial care home management in the       UK in 2013 by Croner-i (http://cronersolutions.co.uk);       in tackling social exclusion in libraries, museums, archives and galleries       in 2009 (http://www.seapn.org.uk/site_content_files/files/newsletter_ns_99.pdf);       and in the UK Equip online tool, developed for the JRF and currently in       use, to help housing providers assess the impact of their existing or       potential new policies (http://www.equip.org.uk/policy-elements/).
The various impacts are cumulating and coming through in the response to       the first results of the most recent survey, PSEUK 2012.
A prime time ITV       documentary based on the initial results was broadcast at 7.30 pm on 28       March 2013 and was watched by an estimated 3.3 million viewers.
It       stimulated widespread debates about cuts in welfare spending.
An e-mail       from the ITV Tonight programme producer on 3 April 2013 stated: `everyone       is delighted with the response we had to Breadline Britain, the ratings       were great 3.3 million and 17% but more than that the emails we've had in       from viewers expressing their concern for our contributors has been       incredible' [g].
