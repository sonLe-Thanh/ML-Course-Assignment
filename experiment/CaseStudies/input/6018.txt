     In addition to wide public dissemination through specialist and generic       media coverage (UK and international) there are four key elements to the       programme's impact:     Changing user community practices: This research       programme has involved real world deployments in law enforcement agencies,       Children's Social Care and direct engagement with schools, children and       young people.
The micro-world simulation BRIGIT has been deployed in       commissioned work to assist in the reconfiguration of safeguarding systems       (Lancashire County Council).
Beneficiaries report positive developments in       their inspection performance on account of learning gained in respect of       practitioner decision-making, with BRIGIT evidencing `proof of concept' in       its practical application.
An iTunes application, `Child Defence', has been released by Isis       Forensics that enables children and young people using mobile phones to       check the age of people they are messaging &#8212; potentially protecting them       from being groomed by adults posing as children online.
Whereas most child       protection software will monitor a child's online activity and be       controlled by parents, this new software empowers children to protect       themselves (5).
The first version has been downloaded over 1000 times and       an enhanced version is in development.
Impact on educational programmes for children and young people (public         service impact).
The collaboration with local schools has also led       to significant impact at various levels.
The main beneficiaries locally       are the two schools we have worked with, in developing and providing       Internet safety lessons to over 500 students, which included Turing-test       like sessions whereby children chatted with people behind the scenes half       of whom were children with the other half adults pretending to be children       (allowing them to understand masquerading tactics utilised by offenders       online).
This led to a strong collaboration with teachers at Queen       Elizabeth School to develop comprehensive lesson plans on the broader       topic of e-safety for key stages 2-5, lesson plans which we claim are       nationally leading.
These are now being rolled out across the region       through the South Lakes Teaching School Alliance (SLTSA).
Adoption by law enforcement agencies: Isis held live         trials with the London Metropolitan police (2013), as well as the       police forces in Kent, Lancashire and Merseyside (2010-2012).
The work was       also in collaboration with the Child Exploitation and Online Protection       Centre (CEOP).
Participants agreed that the toolkit works accurately on       real data sets and significantly reduces the manual time involved: "allows       all victims to be identified and therefore a full range of offending to be       investigated", "provides the ability to focus analysis on specific       information allows investigations to be more focussed and therefore       potential victims of grooming or contact abuse to be identified more       easily", "the only other option is manual analysis which would be much       slower".
This work has transformed strategic thinking on child online       protection.
To date the primary beneficiary is the Canadian Royal Mounted       Police who have licensed the toolkit for use across the country, an       approach that they regard as an "operational necessity".
Other, equally       large-scale agreements are being negotiated but are not yet confirmed as       of the REF census date.
Economic Impact: Isis was featured in the RCUK: Big         Ideas for the Future Report, which presents key projects that       demonstrate the value of public investment in higher education and       research and the positive impact this has on economic growth and the       social wellbeing of the UK.
A spin-out company was created from the Isis       project, Isis Forensics, to license the Isis Toolkit and to exploit the       associated IPR.
This company employs 4 FTE, has received venture capital       of &#163;400,000 and is seen as having very significant growth potential.
They       have signed a major deal with the Canadian Royal Mounted Police as       documented above.
Contributions to policy formation and debate:       Broadhurst et al 2010a (1), cited in the `most read' and `most cited'       columns of the leading international journal: British Journal of         Social Work, has usage statistics that exceeds journal records, with       download rates now standing at 11050 and is cited in a number of       international contexts (EU, Canada, America, New Zealand and China).
This       was used in oral evidence to the Children, Schools and Families Select       Committee hearing 9th of February 2009, and again by Graham Stuart MP to       challenge Ofsted and requiring Ofsted to submit further evidence of its       role and function as part of government review by the same committee       (13.5.2009).
As a consequence of the impact of the teams' work, Professor       Sue White was invited to join the National Social Work Taskforce (2009)       and subsequently the Munro Review of Child Protection (2010) and was able       to directly influence and guide the transformations in frontline practice       that have emanated from the Munro Review of Child Protection.
In       particular, through diffusion of impact and exploitation of research       findings associated with this programme of work, changes have been made to       the national statutory guidance `Working Together' in regard to relaxation       of timescales and boundaries between initial and core assessment (DfE,       2013).
The research on direct risks to children through social media informed       the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on         combating the sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child         pornography, repealing Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA, through the       European Economic and Social Committee's Section for Employment, Social       Affairs and Citizenship Opinion on the Proposal when May-Chahal       acted as expert to the rapporteur.
It also provided a case study in a       report requested by the European Parliament's Committee on Gender Equality       (Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs, an Overview         of the worldwide best practices for rape prevention and for assisting         women victims of rape) proposing the extension of the application of       software tools to assist in the detection and management of cyber coercion       and rape of women and girls.
A policy paper was prepared for the BCS and       presented to Alun Michael MP (2009), and subsequently selected as the       single UK input to the Internet Governance Forum in that year (in       Sharm-Al-Sheikh).
The paper was again tabled at the Internet Governance       Forum the following year (held in Vilnius).
