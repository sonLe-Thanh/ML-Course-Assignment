     [Numbers in square brackets refer to evidence in Section 5].
Ridge's research first came to prominence durin6 the New Labour       administration after 1997, when rising rates of child poverty rates       brought a new focus on its eradication.
She has continued her knowledge       transfer activities with the Coalition government, contributing to the       development of its Child Poverty Strategy.
Through her expert advisory       roles and her networks of longstanding relationships with policy makers,       child poverty lobby groups, public service professionals and charities,       she has sought to influence policy and practice development for the       improvement of low-income children's lives.
An ESRC review of the impact       of their funded research on the development of child poverty policies       names Tess Ridge as one of a few academics to have made `significant       research contributions to the development of this emerging policy area'       [5.9]     In relation to the REF guidance (REF 01.2012, Main Panel C) we identify       four main types of impact.
1.
`Shaping or influence on policy made by government'       Ridge provided invited written and oral evidence and advice on child         poverty to Social Security Select Committees (2002, 2003, 2007, 2009,         2011); to HM Treasury Rural Forum (2002); to the government's Children         and Young People's Unit; and to the 2007/08 Work and Pensions Select         Committee inquiry into child poverty.
Typical were the last-mentioned         Committee's recommendations, which cited Ridge's evidence and urged the         `DWP to work with DCSF, local authorities and other partners to address         the socially excluding impact of poverty on children.
This must be a         priority of the new Child Poverty Unit' [5.6: page 25].
More recently, Ridge has played a key role in ensuring the         incorporation of children's voice in policy development.
Since 2009 she         has had an on-going strategic relationship with the Child Poverty Unit         (tasked with delivering the Child Poverty Strategy) and the DWP.
Child Poverty Act: In 2009 Ridge was commissioned by the DWP to         conduct an expert review of qualitative research with low-income         children and their families.
This was intended to `help meet the         commitment outlined in Ending Child Poverty: Everybody's business           ... to identify gaps in the evidence base and advise the CPU on         best practice when engaging with these groups.
This will inform the         CPU's plans for engaging children and families in developing a "vision"         of 2020 &#8212; what a world in which child poverty has been eradicated could         or should look like' [5.7].
Ridge's review [3.9] and her own research         were core elements of the evidence which informed the Child Poverty Act,         and the national, devolved and local Child Poverty Strategies (including         Wales, Newcastle, North Somerset) [5.1]       During the passage of the Child Poverty Act 2010, Ridge was one of only         two invited academic expert witnesses to give oral evidence to the House         of Commons Public Bill Committee.
At the amendment stage the importance         of children's views and Ridge's expert research review were highlighted         by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, DWP: `Taking into account the         views of children and families living in poverty is central to the         development of our strategies for tackling child poverty... We have         commissioned Dr. Tess Ridge ... who gave evidence to the Committee last         week, to research the experience of children and families living in         poverty.
Her report ...will help to inform the development of the child         poverty strategy [5.10].
Child Poverty Strategy: In 2010 Ridge was seconded to the CPU         for five months, at a critical period in the development of the first         Child Poverty Strategy.
Acting as a `critical friend', she played a key         role in ensuring that children's voices and concerns were robustly and         appropriately sought in the development of the Strategy.
During this         time she providing insight, evidence and advice across a range of policy         areas, including participating in the development of the life chances         and families strand of the Child Poverty Strategy [5.1].

`Policy debate has been stimulated or informed by research evidence           which may have led to the confirmation of policy, change in policy           direction, implementation or withdrawal of policy'.
Ridge's research has stimulated political debates, including in the         House of Lords during the passage of the Welfare Reform Bill, when her         research was cherry-picked by the government, to support proposed         changes in lone mother employment obligations.
Cited in a Ministerial         note which argued that lone parents' employment can provide a good role         model for their children, this evidence was challenged by the         Opposition, citing the more nuanced findings of the study, as Hansard         records from the debate: `The research also found that that is not         always the case.
One of the researchers, Tess Ridge of Bath University,         writes that, "encouraging lone mothers into unstable and insecure labour         markets runs the risk of alienating children from the values of         employment.
For these children work had held out the promise of         something better and that promise had not been kept, so they also         experienced disappointment and for some, an apparent loss of confidence         in the value of work".
[3.9, 5.5]       3.
`Influencing the work of NGOs'       A review of impact in child poverty policy by the ESRC found that         `Interaction between researchers and lobby groups has been an important         feature of child poverty policy development, and ... has helped to         create a mechanism through which research findings influence the         thinking of policy-makers, including opposition political parties, their         advisers and supporters' [5.9] Ridge's work has played a significant         role in this area.
She has worked with national civil society groups to         establish trusted and enduring relationships through knowledge exchange,         policy advice for campaigns and lobbying activities.
At Child Poverty Action Group, she has served for 10 years on their         Policy Advisory Group, advising on child poverty strategy and campaign.
She has regularly written for their publications and for use in lobbying         work.
The CPAG CEO at the time commented: 'Tess's influence helped         encourage the charity to become more child-focused in its approach to         its work.
.....
Her emphasis on a child-centric approach to poverty         solutions and the importance of such an approach for CPAG was vindicated         when child poverty was taken within the ambit of the newly formed         Department for Children, Schools and Families.
As a result, CPAG found         itself well-placed to align its work to the government's Every Child           Matters framework, and to work closely with and influence the         Child Poverty Unit which was established within the Department.
[5.3].
She has a 12 year advisory relationship with The Children's Society,         including sole academic presenter at policy discussion and development         event at St Georges, Windsor.
She carried out collaborative research         with them into rural poverty, and children's experiences of being in         public care and she was recently invited to contribute a submission to         policy discussion at the 2013 CofE General Synod, to be used to engage         with church leadership, grass roots and politicians.
`We need         authoritative, independent and credible evidence that enables us to         argue in the interests of children experiencing poverty.
Tess Ridge's         work has provided us with that evidence and has strengthened our efforts         to put children's experiences at the centre of our campaigning message         and ensured that we continue to speak and act from the perspective of         the child' [5.4].
`Influencing Policy or Practice leading to improved take-up or use           of services'       At a local level Ridge has a long-standing relationship with North         Somerset Council (NSC).
Her research inspired them to develop their         local Child Poverty Strategy with a child-centred perspective.
The         strategy draws extensively on Ridge's work and has been identified among         the strongest in the country by the Charity 4 Children, in their         National Survey of child poverty strategies [5.8].
Helen Caldwell of NSC         writes:       `I referred to your book Childhood poverty and social exclusion           from a child's perspective on a daily basis when I was developing         and rolling out `Join Up Join In' across North Somerset.
Your research         enabled me to roll out a one year funding stream within a wider context         of child poverty and social exclusion from the child's perspective...
Your research was so compelling, all of the schools in North Somerset         agreed to ring-fence the funding for eligible children to spend on         positive activities outside of school hours.'
This `Join up Join in'         campaign resulted in a significant increase in FSM (free school meals)         pupils and families engaging in informal learning activities.
[5.2].
Ridge has made a particular child-focused contribution to policy and         practice development, lobbying and legislative procedures.
In a report         commissioned by ESRC to examine impact, she was identified as being         `particularly important in developing qualitative child-focused studies         that look at what poverty is like for children experiencing it,         including children in lone parent households, and how they see parent's         income.'
[5.9].
In 2011 her research was instrumental in winning the         Diamond Jubilee round of the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Further and         Higher Education: the University of Bath for `Influential research           into child poverty and support for vulnerable people'.
