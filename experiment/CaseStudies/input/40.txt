     Providing evidence to investigative journalist/film-maker to support         key claims     Blakeley gave a detailed statement to libel lawyers for Lionsgate films       to corroborate claims made in John Pilger's film, `War on Democracy'       (2008).
This was invaluable in convincing the lawyers of the veracity of       assertions that the US military had encouraged torture through its       training of Latin American military forces, 1945-2000.
Blakeley's       statement, based on her research for State Terrorism and Neoliberalism,       [3.5], meant that key material on the US' role in torture could be       included in the film.
Influencing, informing and equipping the investigative and advocacy         work of human rights NGOs and lawyers     Detailed analysis of all available flight data on aircraft linked to       rendition has been made possible through the world's first comprehensive       open source database of rendition flights, an interactive map, and       accompanying analysis [3.1; 3.2].
The tool is accessed via The         Rendition Project website and The Guardian's website.
Users       can now interrogate the flight data much more systematically, alongside       analysis and supporting evidence compiled by Blakeley's team, and victims       of rendition can be matched to specific flights to prove their renditions       took place.
The interactive flight tool was developed with the The Guardian's       Datablog team, following a demonstration by Blakeley's team (July 2012) of       the Rendition Flight Database [3.1] to The Guardian reporter, Ian       Cobain, and Simon Rogers (Datablog Director).
Blakeley targeted The         Guardian because it has been one of very few international media       outlets that have systematically covered rendition.
Compilation of the       underlying Rendition Flights Database was made possible after       Blakeley's team shared early research findings with the Human Rights NGO       Reprieve (in April 2011), including analytical content for The         Rendition Project website [3.2], and Blakeley's article `Dirty       Hands, Clean Conscience' [3.4].
This led to Reprieve and other NGOs       sharing flight data (from June 2011 onwards) obtained through various       Freedom of Information requests and investigations.
NGOs have also made       extensive use of the rendition flights database and interactive map, and       have used the easily navigable and comprehensive repository of hundreds of       documents and explanatory commentary published by Blakeley's team on The         Rendition Project website.
As Clare Algar, Executive Director of       Reprieve commented: `Reprieve has formed an excellent working partnership       with the Rendition Project.... [it] provid[es] far superior access to the       data than was previously possible.
This has enabled us to link several       previously unidentified flight paths to prisoners and in turn to make data       on these flight paths available to legal teams in the US       and UK.
We believe that our continued use of the Rendition Project map and       database will lead to further such examples in the future.
The Rendition       Project website has swiftly become the most comprehensive online       repository of rendition-related information and we and our partner       organisations regularly use it in our research and analysis.'

Changing understandings of journalists and the public on rendition and         torture practices     Blakeley's research has provided journalists with evidence to support       claims about the extent of UK involvement in rendition.
Drawing on the       data from the Rendition Flights Database and interactive map [3.1,       3.2], The Guardian published four simultaneous articles on 23 May       2013.
The first lead story [5:3] explained that The Rendition Project       proves many more renditions-related aircraft landed in UK territory than       previously thought.
The reporter consulted Blakeley's team on using the       flight data to ensure his claims could be sustained.
The second story       [5:3] focused on the research project and its findings.
This story       described The Rendition Project as a 'groundbreaking research       project which sheds unprecedented light on one of the most controversial       secret operations of recent years'.
Both stories appeared on line and in       print.
Two further pieces [5:5] were published by The Guardian's       Datablog, one, an explanation of how the data was gathered, the other, a       user-guide for the interactive map.
Cobain noted that The Rendition         Project `has given me, and others, a chance to see clearly the scope       and ambition of the rendition programme .... [and] has made a great       contribution to the efforts to put the puzzle together, in a way that will       be enormously helpful to the public for many years to come' [5:4].
Cobain's statement is supported further when looking at the website       traffic; the result of The Guardian's coverage increased national       and international media coverage of the project, and vastly increased       traffic to The Rendition Project website from around the world, as       indicated by Google Analytics data.
In the month following the launch of       the database and interactive map, there were 20,527 unique visitors to the       website (this compares with figures in the low tens per month prior to       launch and coverage by The Guardian).
Visits following launch and       The Guardian coverage were from users in 144 countries worldwide.
The bounce rate in that period (the percentage of single page visits, i.e.
people leaving the site from the entrance page without interacting with       the page) was 36%.
This means that over 60% of visitors to the site       interacted with the page they entered the site on.
In that period, website       visitors viewed an average of 3.95 individual pages.
This shows that       visitors were exploring the site and reading content.
There were       significant peaks when The Guardian published its story on 22 May,       with 3,972 unique visitors that day, and on 29 May, after widespread news       coverage of the extent of Scottish involvement, with 4,821 unique visits       that day.
Informing and equipping Scottish legislators, and triggering Scottish         police inquiry into use of Scottish airports for rendition     Following The Guardian's coverage of the Rendition Flights       Database and Interactive map [3.1, 3.2], Blakeley's team was approached by       Calum Ross from the Press and Journal newspaper to further       interrogate the database for flights in and out of Scotland.
Blakeley's team uncovered a dozen previously unknown flights through       Scotland that are likely to have been part of rendition operations, since       their onward flights were to locations where CIA prisons were known to be       operating when the flights took place.
The circuits flown by the 12       aircraft in question were also consistent with previous known rendition       operations.
These findings were covered widely in the Scottish national       press [5:8; 5:9], as well as by international media organisations       including the BBC [5:10] and RTV.
The research findings on the use of       Scottish airports were then debated in the Scottish parliament, with SMPs       referring specifically to the research.
As a result, in June 2013 the Lord       Advocate for Scotland instructed a Scottish police investigation, citing       The Rendition Project's findings.
In July 2013, Blakeley's team was       approached by the senior investigating officer for the Scottish police       inquiry, to provide a dossier of evidence on the Scottish rendition       flights as part of the investigation.
Collaboration with the investigation       is on-going.
