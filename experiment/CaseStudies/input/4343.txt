     Changes to National Mental Health Policy.
Following the founding research, and regional trials of Early       Intervention (EI) the NHS has invested over &#163;150m in making these services       available throughout the country and now all young people with a first       episode of psychosis are required to receive services from them, based       upon the service and implementation framework developed in Birmingham for       the Department of Health [2].
Since 2008, the number of such services has increased and National       Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) have now recommended these for       future mental health service provision in the UK and form part of national       mental health policy [1].
Early intervention in psychosis has remained a priority through the       change in Government, and in June 2010 the Minister of State for Care       Services stated in 2010 that:     "The evidence is pretty compelling that by intervening early, you can         make a real difference, you can avoid someone being admitted into acute         hospital care.
So, this is really a no-brainer, it makes sense to invest         in early interventions to go back upstream and make sure that we prevent         these sort of problems."
[2]     The NHS operating framework for 2011/2 [3] requires early intervention       services to be routinely provided as part of the core set of mental health       services.
While the Coalition's Mental Health Strategy in 2011 [4]       confirms early intervention as a core part of mental health services to be       developed into other disorders.
Early intervention was also discussed in       parliament in November 2011 [5], with the Minister of State for Care       Services arguing that     "...patients with early onset psychosis benefit from early         intervention services, and assertive outreach engages with severe and         persistent mental disorder such as schizophrenia.
That shared approach         in system delivery is already beginning to show results, because 10,300         new patients with early diagnosis of psychosis were engaged with early         intervention in psychosis services this year, which is the highest ever         recorded figure".
In recognition of this work, and to assist with its continued       implementation in the UK mental healthcare system, Prof Birchwood was       invited to become a member two NICE guideline committees for schizophrenia       in 2012.
The first is the guideline group for Schizophrenia and Psychosis       in Young People; the second is the revision of the adult Schizophrenia       guideline.
These will issue their final reports in 2014.
Professor       Birchwood is a member of this committee of senior UK clinicians and       academics in his expert capacity in CBT and early intervention in       psychosis.
Improved outcomes following early intervention in psychosis     1.
Clinical benefits.
NICE concluded that Early Intervention in       psychosis approach has been shown to reduce the severity of symptoms,       improve relapse rates and significantly decrease the use of inpatient       care, in comparison to standard care from community mental health teams       [1].
These improved outcomes for psychosis arising from the early       intervention in psychosis teams have been reported in a NHS Confederation       Mental Health Network Briefing in 2011 [6].
They reported that EI services       have quickly demonstrated improved clinical outcomes combined with       considerable cost savings through reduced use of hospital beds.
In the       longer term, reducing the number of young people remaining in mental       health services with lifelong disability has the potential to save even       more.
Without the pioneering research in Birmingham and the acclaimed       progenitor early intervention service, the later trials and transformation       of care would not have happened.
2.
Patient and carer acceptability.
Our UK national evaluation of       EI services [7] reported clients' and carers' experience, finding that       early intervention in psychosis: offered activities and services that were       youth friendly and made sense; helped them come to terms with their       illness and understand why they had become unwell; and worked with them       over time to identify triggers and early warning signs.
This study found       that the family and carer approach fostered by EI has received       overwhelming endorsement from service users.
Many felt their families were       supportive in the care process, for example, advocating on their behalf,       helping them cope with symptoms and helping develop and use relapse plans.
These benefits continue to have impact as EI services are extended.
3.Economic benefits.
With the current UK population, approximately       500,000 individuals will be affected by schizophrenia in their lifetime,       meaning that cost savings are very significant.
The overall costs of an       early psychosis service are considerably less compared to standard       Community Mental Health Team care, mainly as a result of reduced       readmission rates.
The recent study by McCrone, Park and Knapp [8,9]       explored EI services and standard care focusing on the impact of       vocational outcomes, homicide costs, suicide costs and the long-term       economic impact of EI.
Thirty six per cent of people receiving EI are in employment compared         to 27 per cent in standard care.
Using a minimum wage rate, the saving         (averaged over the entire EI cohort, whether employed and unemployed) is         &#163;2,087 per person, in addition to healthcare savings.
With EI the annual costs due to homicide are reduced by 93% compared         with those for standard care.
Suicide rates and the associated costs are reduced by 67% under EI         compared with standard care.
The long-term impact of EI is dependent on what happens to readmission         rates after discharge from the EI team.
If the readmission rates remain         constant then the expected saving over eight years is &#163;36,632.
If the         rates immediately become equal to standard care after EI team discharge         the figure is &#163;17,427.
Finally, if the rates converge gradually the         expected saving is &#163;27,029 per individual.
Impact on wider mental health policy and practice.
During 2012/3 the success of early intervention in psychosis has inspired       change in policy and practice in the wider arena of mental health.
In       November 2012, the National Schizophrenia Commission [10], in reviewing       the state of care for schizophrenia in general, argued that "EI has         been the most positive development in mental health services since the         beginning of community care" and that "We have seen what can be         achieved with innovative and creative solution focused approaches to         care and treatment through early intervention in psychosis services.
Today, instead of a life sentence, young people in early intervention         services are given hope.
They are supported to recover, with many         returning to college or the workplace to live an ordinary life like         everyone else.
We want these outcomes for everyone living           with schizophrenia and psychosis".
The commission goes on to       recommend that the specialized model of care adopted in early psychosis       needs to be adopted in schizophrenia more generally.
The Birmingham team       have been at the forefront of proposing that the logic of EI applies to       all mental health problems most of which arise in youth [11].
In the       recent Mental Health Policy Implementation guidance [12] commissioners are       urged, "Health services should intervene in the early stages of         psychosis...and public services recognize that people at risk of mental         health problems take appropriate, timely action using innovative service         models".
Such innovative service models have been developed only in       Birmingham, Australia and Ireland [11].
International Impact     This research has been taken up internationally with services in       Australia, USA, Holland, Denmark, Canada, and this impact has led to       international awards including the prestigious Richard Wyatt award to       Professor Birchwood in 2006.
Professor Birchwood has been invited to       lecture extensively in these countries on the `UK model' of early       intervention and its implementation.
They have visited Birmingham services       on several occasions; in Holland for example, he advised on the set-up of       services in Amsterdam and in middle Holland (`Rivierduinen' Midden       Holland) between 2008-2013, and received staff on exchange to Birmingham.
