     Read's research and publications have contributed to a major       international reassessment of Apollinaire's art criticism.
They have also       enhanced the public understanding of his role in the development of       literary and artistic modernism, and of how artists including Picasso,       Giacometti, and Dufy responded creatively to literary stimulation.
This       impact has been achieved by Read's own publications, public lectures, and       media appearances, and has also been mediated through reference to Read's       research in the work of other researchers, writers, and commentators.
Impact activities:              Exhibitions and exhibition catalogues.
As a         result of his research into the creative exchanges between writers and         artists in France in the early decades of the twentieth century, Read         was invited to contribute to exhibition catalogues and to act as an         adviser for two exhibitions at the new Centre           Pompidou-Metz, France.
Read has contributed to various exhibition         catalogues since 2008, including a series of essays for the         encyclopaedic catalogue of the exhibition 1917, the second major         exhibition held at the Centre Pompidou- Metz (2011).
Read's         contributions to the catalogue (on two theatre productions, the art         market, the work of Picasso, and daily life in Paris in 1917), his         earlier publications, meetings in Metz and Paris, and correspondence         with curators helped to shape the organization and presentation of         sections of the exhibition, particularly the importance given to         collaborative projects realized by artists and writers, and to         experimental home-front stage productions in 1917, all presented in ways         designed to engage directly with a wide international audience.
His         on-going interdisciplinary research on cultural events during the First         World War, and particularly on Picasso and Cocteau, led to his being         commissioned to write the text for the illustrated book to accompany the         follow-up exhibition at the Centre Pompidou-Metz, on the ballet Parade         (17 November 2012 to 18 March 2013).
Parade was produced in May         1917 by Diaghilev's Russian Ballet, and written, composed, designed, and         choreographed by Cocteau, Satie, Picasso, and Massine.
Read provides         both specialists and a wide general readership with an illustrated         presentation of the ballet, describing creative processes and defining         the role of each artist involved and the interplay between them.
Work on         this book included meetings with the exhibition curators to discuss         material to be included in the exhibition.
In addition to his work for         the Centre Pompidou-Metz, Read was also commissioned to write an essay         for the catalogue of Picasso in Paris 1900-1907 (an exhibition         held at the Van Gogh and Picasso Museums, Amsterdam and Barcelona, in         2011).
This catalogue was published in separate editions in five         languages (Catalan, Dutch, English, French, and Spanish).
In addition to         his contributions to exhibition catalogues, Read has also delivered a         series of public lectures at La Halle St Pierre, Paris (November 2008),         the Picasso Museum, Antibes (February 2010), the Montpellier Book-Fair         (June 2012), and the Centre Pompidou-Metz (September 2012).
Read's         recent research on Picasso's first studios in Paris and his interest in         Darwinism underpinned a series of illustrated public lectures on the         intellectual and literary environment that fostered Picasso's early         creativity, with venues including the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (March         2011).
Read's research on literary connections in modern sculpture, and         on Giacometti's reading, writing, and illustrating of literary texts         (presented in Read and Kelly 2009b), led to a conference on European         poetry and sculpture (organized by Read and Hutchinson) held at the         Henry Moore Institute, Leeds (November 2009).
This one-day event         provided a forum not only for academics, but also for creative artists,         curators, and members of the public to meet, discuss, and interact.
Publications in the press.
Read developed and synthesized         his accumulated research on Picasso's life and work, and the context in         which the artist operated, in a special `Picasso' issue of the popular         French monthly magazine L'Histoire, for which Read was         consultant and principal contributor (October 2008).
He is also a         regular contributor to the Times Literary Supplement (seven         reviews and features on modern French literature and the visual arts         since 2008).
Radio programmes.
Read has contributed to radio programmes         on French and Swiss national radio: Radio France, France Culture, Les           nouveaux chemins de la connaissance, a 50-minute live programme         featuring Read speaking on eroticism in the writings of Apollinaire         (broadcast on 22 June 2009); Radio Suisse Romande, Entre les lignes,         a one- hour programme featuring Read speaking on Apollinaire, Correspondance           avec les artistes and related topics (broadcast on 4 January         2010).
Reach of the impact:                Over 200,000 tickets were bought for the exhibition 1917 at           the Centre Pompidou-Metz.
71,800 copies were sold of the 2008 `Picasso' special issue of the           French monthly L'Histoire, for which Read was the principal           consultant and contributor.
The Times Literary Supplement, to           which Read is a regular contributor on modern French literature and           art, has a readership of c. 100,000, of which half is in the USA.
The French and Swiss national radio programmes to which Read           contributed (Radio France, France Culture, Les nouveaux chemins de             la connaissance; Radio Suisse Romande, Entre les lignes)           have 100,000+ national audiences.
Significance of the impact:       Through his contributions to exhibition catalogues, his scholarly         publications, the wealth of new documents he has made available (in         French and often in English translation), his public lectures in both         languages, his contributions to national radio broadcasts, and his         regular journalism, Read has substantially shifted public perceptions of         the interplay between art and literature in twentieth-century France.
Countering received wisdom and earlier art-historical judgements (often         based on poor translations and limited documentation), Read's research         and publications have contributed to the international reassessment of         Apollinaire's art criticism and his influential participation in the         development of literary and artistic modernism.
In particular, Read has         made Apollinaire's hitherto unknown drawings available to a mainstream         audience.
More broadly, he has shown the public how artists respond         creatively to their cultural environment and particularly to the         literary company they keep, most notably in his publications on Picasso,         Giacometti, and Dufy.
Furthermore, Read has helped to inform exhibition         curators at the Centre Pompidou-Metz regarding exhibition content,         thereby ensuring that misconceptions have been avoided in the         presentation of these exhibitions to the public.
Read's work has been highlighted and recommended to a wide general         audience, notably by John Richardson in his bestselling Life of           Picasso: `there is no better guide than Read's excellent study, Picasso           et Apollinaire' (iii.
349); by Neil Cox in his Tate publication The           Picasso Book: Read's book is `riveting'; and the 2009 Yale         exhibition catalogue Picasso and the Allure of Language: Read's         Picasso and Apollinaire is `a key publication'.
Read's         publications are also, for example, extensively cited throughout         Laurence Campa's landmark biography of Apollinaire, published by         Gallimard in 2013, with an English-language edition in preparation.
