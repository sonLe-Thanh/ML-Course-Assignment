            As highlighted above, the research of Hawton and colleagues was         instrumental in leading to the withdrawal of co-proxamol (and its toxic         component dextropropoxyphene) in the UK from 2005 onwards (Section 5,         Sources 1-5).
The resulting benefits were shown during the initial three year         withdrawal phase (2005-7) in terms of a major reduction in deaths, both         suicidal and accidental, from co-proxamol poisoning and absence of         significant increases in deaths involving other analgesics likely to         have been prescribed instead of co-proxamol.
(See Hawton et al, 2009,         2011, cited in Section 3).
More recently the long-term benefits of this initiative have been         demonstrated through evaluation of its impact during the six years 2005         - 2010, including the three years following full withdrawal.
This has         indicated about 600 fewer deaths in the UK from co-proxamol poisoning         and again no major substitution of deaths from fatal poisoning with         other analgesics.
(See Hawton et al, 2012, cited in Section 3).
This initiative has been one of most important contributions to the         success of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England (see         Section 5, Sources 1-3).
This initiative did not stop in the UK.
Following presentation of the         Oxford team's findings by Hawton to the European Medicines Agency         (EMEA), the EMEA recommended to the European Union (EU) that         non-prescribing of dextropropoxyphene should become policy throughout         the EU.
The decision was endorsed in June 2010.
(Section 5, Source 6).
The UK and EU initiative prompted the US Food and Drug Administration         to take action in 2010 to withdraw dextropropoxyphene in the USA.
(Section 5, Source 7).
In 2010 Health Canada did likewise in Canada, as did the equivalent         authorities in New Zealand, Singapore and Taiwan (Section 5, Sources         8-10).
Thus it is anticipated that the work of Hawton and his team will         contribute to the saving of lives in many countries, not just in the UK.
