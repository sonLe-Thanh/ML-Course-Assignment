     Presentation of the results of CARE-HF in 2005 had an immediate effect on       all subsequent clinical guidelines related to Heart Failure.
The UK       (NICE), European Society (that also covers Russia, Middle East and North       Africa), North America, Australia and New Zealand and many other national       guidelines around the world, including the latest guidelines in 2013 have       endorsed the original recommendations based on CARE-HF, which stands out       as the landmark study in this field.
As a consequence of CARE-HF,       Professor Cleland has been invited to inform many and develop some of       these practice guidelines.
For example, the 2013 ESC Guidelines on cardiac pacing and cardiac       resynchronization therapy state:- "CARE-HF, with a 29-month follow-up         period, was the first study to show a reduction in total mortality by         CRT, compared with control, but without significant lowering of the risk         of sudden cardiac death.
However, in the extension study with a         37.4-month follow-up time, 46 there was a significant 5.6% reduction in         the absolute risk of dying suddenly" (Reference 5.
Eur Heart J.
2013; 34: 2281-329)     The ACC/AHA guidelines on heart failure state:- "Pharmacological         therapy is not a consistent determinant of HRQOL; therapies such as ACE         inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) improve HRQOL only         modestly or delay the progressive worsening of HRQOL in HF.
At present,         the only therapies shown to improve HRQOL are cardiac resynchronization         therapy (CRT) and certain disease management and educational approaches"         and "These results have included a decrease of approximately 30%         in rehospitalization and reductions in all-cause mortality in the range         of 24% to 36%.
Improvement in survival is evident as early as the first         3 months of therapy."
(Source 1).
The National Heart Foundation of Australia and the Cardiac Society of       Australia and New Zealand stated that: "Two key placebo-controlled         RCTs [Comparison of Medical Therapy, Pacing, and Defibrillation in Heart         Failure (COMPANION) and Cardiac Resynchronization in Heart Failure Study         (CARE-HF)] ....showed that CRT reduced the risk of death from any cause         and hospital admission for worsening HF ....[RRR in death of ... 36%         with CRT-P in CARE-HF].
In CARE-HF, the RRR in HF hospitalization with         CRT-P was 52%.
These benefits were additional to those gained with         conventional treatment, including a diuretic, digoxin, an ACE inhibitor,         a beta-blocker, and an MRA."
(Source 2).
The NICE guidelines, introduced in 2007, were further revised in 2010       (Source 3) and stated that: "Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT)         is one of the major new advances in the management of heart failure,         resulting in reduced morbidity and increased survival of heart failure         patients with dys-synchrony.
The Guideline Development Group were aware         of new advances in the evidence-base for CRT, widening the indications         for these devices to involve patients with less severe heart failure".
There is evidence that clinical guidelines have and continue to have an       impact on clinical practice.
There are about 10,000 people with heart       failure per million people in the UK, of which about 400 per million per       year (pmpy) may become suitable for CRT.
Currently about 120 pmpy       population are recorded as receiving these devices (under-reporting is       considered likely) in the UK with rates doubling from 2007 to 2011       (Sources 4 and 5).
On current estimates, over a 5 year period about 40,000       people in the UK will receive these devices and, of these, 8,000 more       would expect to be alive at 5 years as a result.
The increase in use has       been even greater in other countries.
In Italy and Germany (Source 5),       implantation rates are substantially greater than in the UK.
In the USA       CRT implantation has risen from about 40,000 devices in 2006 to 110,000 in       2010 (&gt;300 pmpy; Source 6).
Of 7 billion people worldwide, 2.8 million will become eligible each year       for CRT.
This means millions more patients with heart failure have       increased survival beyond 5 years due to the seminal work in Hull on CRT.
A third major beneficiary of the CRT study has been the companies who make       these devices (Medtronic, Boston-Scientific, St Jude, Sorin, Biotronik).
The anticipated growth in the world-market will certainly stimulate       further innovation and improvement.
The world market for CRT devices is       estimated to grow to about $2.8 billion annually by 2015 (Source 7).
The Cardiomyopathy Association &#8212; a patient-led organization (source 8)       and the British Heart Foundation (Source 9) both highlight the importance       of CRT as a treatment option for patients suffering with left ventricular       systolic dysfunction.
These public information web-sites receive thousands       of hits per year reflecting the significant reach of the research       findings.
The key beneficiaries of the work on CRT are patients.
CRT       reduces the annual risk of death by about 40%, with 21 more patients alive       at 5 years for every 100 patients treated.
This is a large effect compared       with most other treatments in heart medicine (e.g.
a much larger effect       than heart bypass surgery).
In addition to the effects on mortality, many       patients also experience improvement in symptoms and quality of life.
CRT       reduces the risk of recurrent hospitalisations for worsening heart failure       which may largely offset the cost of device implantation.
Health economic       analyses suggest that CRT is highly cost-effective (Reference 4 above) and       so is an efficient use of health service resources.
