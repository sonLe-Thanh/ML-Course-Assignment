     Professor Townshend was included amongst a list of 300 public       intellectuals nominated by the       Observer in May 2011, demonstrating the extent to which his       research expertise on modern       political violence is relevant to current dilemmas.
This in turn ensures a       large readership for his       books and regular invitations to advise governments and policy makers.
When         God Made Hell was       widely reviewed in military circles.
Colonel Alexander Alderson, Director       of the British Army's       Stability Operations and Counter-Insurgency Centre, who called it a       `superb book', also pointed out       that although Townshend `skilfully avoids making direct comparisons' with       the 2003 campaign,       readers should not [source 1].
A reviewer in the Australian         Army Journal (2011) stressed the       book's `lessons for today'.
Townshend is `highly regarded' in Ireland for       his exceptional knowledge       of the troubled years, 1916-23, and was thus a `natural choice' as one of       three members of the       academic advisory committee for the Irish Government's Military         Service Pensions Project, one       of the last and the largest archives from Ireland's revolutionary period,       to be released to the public.
The project will make public 300,000 files of applications for pensions       for military service in Ireland       1916-23.
Townshend's research is providing historical context and       elucidating the significance of       the material for both archivists and the general public during Ireland's       forthcoming `Decade of       Commemoration' [source 2].
Charles Townshend's Terrorism.
A Very Short Introduction, part of       an extremely successful series       and designed for a broad audience, has been a pivotal means through which       he has been able to       engage a range of non-academic audiences.
Its broad impact on public         understanding and       discourse, what might be called its contribution to `terrorism         literacy', is indicated by its sales       figures and its translations into languages other than English.
The first       English edition sold 24,000,       and the second edition had sold almost 5,000 more by February 2013.
Editions in Spanish,       German, Italian, Greek, Bosnian, Japanese, Korean and Simplified Chinese       have been published       [sources 3, 4].
Furthermore, the specific impacts of Townshend's       research mediated through his       Very Short Introduction are demonstrated by its deployment in the       following contexts.
Influence on educational programmes:     Townshend's particular insights into the nature of terrorism shape       discussions in courses in several       disciplines in many higher education institutions in Britain and North       America.
Terrorism.
A Short         Introduction is a key text, for example, in a philosophy course at       the University of Western Ontario,       and an education module in New Jersey [sources 5, 6].
British       examples include undergraduate       modules in Law at Manchester [LAWS30711], Sociology at Kent [SO594], and       History at       Cambridge [Paper 6, British Political and Constitutional History since       1867].
Beyond Higher       Education, Townshend's text has also been used by the For Action         Initiative (FAI), a private       enterprise in the USA, which seeks `to raise awareness about the effects       of public trauma and       terrorism on people, societies, and the world, and to educate teachers and       our youth about the       history of terrorism, international relations, global security, and       domestic and international policies.
The FAI seeks to inspire young people to take action&#8212;as individuals and as       part of their       community&#8212;and supports efforts that someday might prevent future acts of       global terrorism'.
As       the FAI explains, `In order for children to feel safe, not vulnerable, for       them to understand others       and not develop prejudice, and for them to become effective leaders of       tomorrow, they need to be       taught about the challenges in our world, i.e.
terrorism &#8212; the concept,       the history, the causes, the       consequences.'
Charles Townshend's work currently features as a key text       in lesson H-UIV-L3,       'Challenges in Enhancing Media Literacy Regarding Global Terrorism' [source         7].
Influencing Policy and Practice:     a) Most significantly, Townshend's expertise has made a       significant contribution to the UK       Government's Prevent strategy, launched in 2007, which sought to       stop people becoming       terrorists or supporting terrorism.
Prevent is one of the four strands in       the Government's overall       counter-terrorism strategy (CONTEST).
The Home office confirms that Terrorism.
A Very Short         Introduction is core background reading for civil servants who work       on the CONTEST strategy, as       `it provides an invaluable overview of a complex area which is accessible       to all levels'.
His work is       also included as recommended reading for the public order and civil       contingency module on the       Strategic Command Course which trains police officers aiming to become       Assistant Chief       Constables or above (College of Policing, formerly the National Police       Improvement Agency).
Townshend acted as an advisor to the Prevent training programme, providing       a crucial historical       perspective and highlighting that the greatest hazard inherent in       responses to terrorism is the       impulse towards imitation, often heightened by official over-reaction.
A       videoed interview with       Townshend was used in training for professionals whose jobs brought them       into contact with       young and/or vulnerable people, particularly educators, and police       officers.
The resulting DVD was       distributed to universities, and to all local authorities and police       authorities in the UK.
The Prevent       training ran from 2007-2011, and many aspects continue following a review       in 2011.
The DVD is       still used by some police and local authorities and by some universities       in their Prevent       presentations to staff in contact with young people [source 8].
b) Defence Threat Reduction.
Townshend took part in a workshop at       the Centre for the Study of       Terrorism and Political Violence, University of St Andrews in January       2012, part of a programme       on `Terrorist Innovations in Weapons of Mass Effect' sponsored by the US       Government's Defence       Threat Reduction Agency [DTRA].
This workshop addressed the ways in which       terrorist innovation       can be understood, predicted and responded to.
Together with the Director       of the DTRA, David       Hamon, Townshend was responsible for summing up the proceedings of the       workshop and       indicating their policy relevance [source 9].
