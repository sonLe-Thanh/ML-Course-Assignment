     Peer led Self-Help Groups and Organisations     Our research with and into peer led self-help groups and organisations       has directly influenced national and regional initiatives aimed at       improving health and social care commissioners' understanding of the       value, role and spectrum of self-help groups.
Findings from our research       on the benefits of peer led groups and organisations have been included in       the Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE) national guidelines for       commissioners on developing and sustaining user-led organisations.
In       addition, findings from the Big Lottery-funded ESTEEM project have been       dovetailed with a Department of Health project to develop a national       online tool kit for practitioners on the most effective ways to develop       and support local self-help groups.
Following completion of the research,       online and paper resources for self-help groups, practitioners and       commissioners, hosted by Self Help Nottingham (SHN), were launched at       Anglia Ruskin University in July 2013 and have formed the basis for       training targeted at health and social care workers, criminal justice       personnel, third sector agencies and key members of patient groups.
Eighty-four people to date have completed the training (corroborative       statement from SHN).
Four regional seminars on the core findings from the       research have ensured that links have been made for audiences of       commissioners and community practitioners between support for self-help       groups and current policy initiatives such as personalised care and       support for people with long term conditions.
SHN have presented the       findings at the European Network for Self Help and are planning a national       event for 2014.
The ESTEEM research has also informed an accredited       course, delivered by our partners SHN, the national specialists in the       field, at the Nottingham University's Institute of Mental Health in May       2013, for professionals in mental health on working with self-help groups.
This study is also informing Nottingham's Local Education Training Board       in supporting the NHS to integrate training on ways in which professionals       can support self-help groups.
The practical application and impact of the       ESTEEM study was recognised with inclusion in the Big Ideas for the         Future 2011 report, jointly published by the Research Councils UK       and Universities UK.
At the local level, Essex-based health and social       care commissioners have written initiatives that support peer led groups       into their service specifications (MIME 2012; corroborative statement from       Head of Mental Health Commissioning, ECC).
Peer/Citizen Researchers     Prominent examples of the impact of involving service users as       researchers have been the sustained commissioning of two peer/citizen       research groups (CRGs) and the formation in 2011 of a third group.
These       groups are:            The South Essex Service User Research Group (SE-SURG), a group of         mental health service users, was established at Anglia Ruskin University         in 2005 following their involvement with the employment survey detailed         in our second case study.
SE-SURG have carried out 14 further studies         commissioned to inform local service development during 2008 -2013, with         support from Secker.
WhyNot!, an older people's Research Group, was established in 2007 and         built on our initial training programme for older people as researchers.
Twenty-two people completed the training, of whom 10 were founding         members in the self-organising Research Group.
Since 2008 they have         carried out 14 projects as direct commissions from the County Council,         District Councils, NHS and Age UK which we have supported on a         `needs-led' basis.
Two further cohorts have been trained between 2009         and 2011 (Munn-Giddings, McVicar, O'Brien &amp; Boyce).
The North Essex Research Network, a group of mental health service         users similar to SESURG, was established in 2012, following training in         research provided as part of the Making Involvement Matter in Essex         (MIME) project (2009-2012).
The group has nine members and completed         several studies under the auspices of MIME, with a further two         evaluations of recovery initiatives commissioned in 2013 by the NHS         Greater Eastern Commissioning Support Unit (Secker and Munn-Giddings).
Feedback from commissioners demonstrates their increased awareness of the       positive advantages of peer research and their policy commitment to       developing peer researchers in other parts of their adult services.
For       example, with our support Healthwatch Essex is developing the model with       broader citizen groups to inform strategic planning (corroborative       statement from Head of Research and Analysis, ECC).
In addition both       WhyNot!
and SE-SURG research projects have informed changes in practice at       a local level.
For example, WhyNot!'
was commissioned to research into       technologies that help older people remain in their home.
The study       resulted in the Council targeting practitioner training as well as       developing a demonstration facility, both of which have led to an uptake       in the service.
Similarly, several studies carried out by SE-SURG have had       a local impact, for example in supporting the modernisation of day       services in South Essex, resulting in a shift away from staff-led       building-based services towards peer support and use of mainstream       community facilities.
Subsequent evaluation found high levels of       satisfaction with the new services amongst day service users.
Feedback from members of these Citizen Research Groups highlights       personal impacts including improved confidence, new skills, employment       opportunities and feeling empowered to influence change (WhyNot!
corroborative statement; SE-SURG Activity Report 2008-2013).
Further       impact has stemmed from replication of SE-SURG's employment survey and the       associated pioneering engagement of service users as researchers within       the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pavia (see our second       case study).
The value of service user involvement in research has been       recognised in subsequent studies carried out at the University of Pavia.
Recognition of the quality of SE-SURG's and WhyNot!
's work by Essex       Health and Social Care Commissioners is evidenced by an invitation to       Secker and Munn-Giddings in 2009 to tender successfully for a &#163;500,000       three-year initiative aimed at extending service user involvement in       commissioning decisions.
This initiative, Making Involvement Matter in       Essex (MIME), was delivered in partnership with a user-led training       organisation ARW (Advocacy Really Works) and enabled us to engage a wider       group of service users and carers in research.
Twenty MIME members       received training in research skills in 2011, of whom, as noted above,       nine formed the North Essex Research Network and have carried out studies       with impact on commissioning strategy and service development in Essex,       for example introduction of a helpline web chat service for younger       people.
As with SE-SURG members, personal benefits identified in feedback       from MIME members include improved confidence and feeling useful and       empowered to influence change (MIME, 2012).
As well as supporting the development of research skills these types of       initiatives develop social capital and skills amongst service users and       carers which they put to use in many ways.
For example, members of WhyNot!
now sit on Essex County Council's Research and Governance Committee and       have used their training in their local communities to carry out a local       community consultation that increased rural transport options (WhyNot!
corroborative statement).
This highlights the potential of this approach       to build skills that can inform and impact on other democratic processes.
