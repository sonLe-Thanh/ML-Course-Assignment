     The impact of the research undertaken at Aberdeen relates to       practitioners and professional       services, where professional and industry standards have been informed as       a result of research       findings.
As stated by Professor R. D. Hooton, a world-leading contributor       to the cement and       construction industry in Canada: "... the Chemistry Department at the         University of Aberdeen has         made the biggest contributions globally to our understanding of both         hydration of cements and         fundamental understanding of durability of cementitious materials for         use in concrete" [a].
The key outcome of the particular research project as described was to       inform       international standards beyond the EU.
As verified by the Portland Cement       Association, the       industry trade association for North America, "in the last several         years, the US cement industry has         made significant progress in its continuing efforts to improve the         sustainability of the built         environment, and a key component of that effort has been the development         of specification         requirements for Portland-limestone cements.
After several years'         effort, in 2012, US blended         cement specifications were revised to include cements with up to 15%         limestone.
While other         research has gone into this effort, a key component of the rationale         supporting changes to both         sets of specifications was results of your (Glasser) research related to         the reactions that limestone         undergoes during cement hydration, their volumetric changes, and the         thermodynamic stability of         the resulting phases.
We continue to use the results of this research in         the on-going educational         efforts with specifiers, architects and engineers..." [b].
Dr       Kosmatka further clarifies the overall       economic impact implied by the benefits derived from this research: "It         is difficult to estimate the         economic impact of these changes for the concrete construction industry         in the US.
A roughly 10%         saving with regard to CO2 and other emissions         and energy has made the industry more efficient as         well as more sustainable, both of which help the competitiveness in the         roughly $19 billion (US)         cement industry" [b].
The impact of Glasser's work on the North American cement industry is       further       supported by Al Innis, Vice President of Holcim (US), who states "...The         work you have done on         limestone cements has been a key component in having the US standards         accept blended         cements containing up to 15% limestone.
This change in standards gives         our industry and Holcim         (US) in particular the opportunity to provide our customers a higher         quality product with a lower         carbon footprint..." [c].
In addition, to confirmation of new standards in the USA, specifications       in Canada       have also been developed.
As Professor Hooton confirms: "The work by         Matschei, Lothenbach         and Glasser has been important for the understanding of         Portland-limestone cements that led to         their adoption in cement specifications in Canada (CSA A3000) in 2008         and in the USA (ASTCM         C595) in 2012.
The use of these cements is now incorporated into the         Canadian building codes,         and their use is increasing" [a].
Limestone addition to cement contributes to properties through three       mechanisms:       particle packing effects which reduce water demand, nucleation effects       which accelerate hydration       reactions, and production of carboaluminate phases which reduce porosity.
According to a 2011       State of the Art Report from the Portland Cement Association, Glasser's       work "provided         quantitative calculation of the phases that may be present...... a great         step forward in         understanding these systems" [d]     The thermodynamic models derived from the research have now been       incorporated       into the GEMS suite (Gibbs Energy       Minimization Software for         Geochemical Modelling), originally       developed by the Swiss Nuclear Organisation, and now managed by the Paul       Scherrer Institute.
Explicitly the research work has been fundamental to the CEMDATA07       database, included in the       GEMS TDB software package (GEMS Thermodynamic       DataBase) [e].
Empa, who       co-supervised       the research project, confirm that the Aberdeen research was a fundamental       component to the       cement database "was published in 2007-2009 and based on work carried         out at Empa         (Lothenbach et al., 2008; M&#246;schner et al.
2008, 2009; Schmidt et al.
2008) and a PhD carried out       both at the University of Aberdeen and at Empa (Matschei et al, 2008)"       [f].
In overall terms, the economic benefit is hard to calculate, although the       saving in       CO2 emissions is more straightforward.
The world production of       Portland cement is about 3 x109       tonnes per year.
If one third of this production uses 10% limestone       replacement, and assuming       production in efficient equipment, the net saving in CO2       emissions is of the order of 85 million       tonnes per year.
From this has to be deducted the energy input of       quarrying and grinding       limestone, but this is comparatively low (only a few million tonnes per       year), Thus a reduction of       the order of 80 million tonnes per year carbon dioxide emission is       achieved, with considerable       scope for greater reductions still realisable as the process continues to       gain traction.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has proposed strategies to reduce       global       CO2 emissions by 52% from 2007 to 2050 [g].
The so-called Blue       Map Scenario places different       requirements on different sectors of the global economy.
The cement       industry is required to reduce       its CO2 emissions by 22.5% from 2007 to 2050.
Limestone       substitution in Portland cement at levels       now shown by this work to be safe and reliable will achieve around 1/6th       of the 450 million tonnes       per year reduction in CO2 emissions required.
Furthermore, the success of this project has led to financial support for       bolder and       more radical initiatives for reducing CO2 emissions from the       cement industry.
The Qatar       Foundation has awarded a US$5.3M grant to the University of Aberdeen       (together with the       University of Dundee) to investigate further reductions in the CO2 input       to structural concrete and       increased functional performance of products.
This project, which       commenced in September 2012,       is focussed on indigenous Gulf region resources.
The project has at its       heart development of two       novel cements: one being a low carbon-input cement base of calcium       sulphoaluminate, and a       second carbon-negative cement type.
