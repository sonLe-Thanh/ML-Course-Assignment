     The UK needs to develop more solutions to reduce GHG emissions from       existing buildings.
By identifying the role of human behaviour, importance       of socio-technical factors and need to raise awareness of sustainability,       SBERG has been able to pilot schemes which have successfully engaged       householders, changed their behaviour and reduced emissions.
The group's       work has also raised public awareness and influenced local and national       policy.
The research outputs have had a direct impact on household behaviour;       policy development; environmental performance of buildings; and public       awareness.
Social landlords and tenants     The research outputs from the CCC project have had a direct impact on       social landlords and their tenants.
First, the research had a direct       impact on 53 tenants who received energy use feedback and guidance on how       to reduce their energy consumption.
All these people reduced their energy       consumption over the 12 months between March 2011 and March 2012, by an       average of 18%, through a range of behaviour changes.
Subsequently, Harrogate Borough Council (who were one of the research       subjects studied in the project) integrated the research outputs into       their approach to mitigation of their social housing, recognising the need       to develop "strategies for promoting and encouraging people to save         energy", based on the "research outcomes from the extensive CCC         study".
Harrogate specifically commented that "the marked         success of the Benchmarking group in changing behaviour/breaking habits         and reducing energy use has been really useful in persuading people of         the importance of a) feedback and b) a feedback method that works."
[5.1]     In addition to those directly involved with the CCC project, the research       outputs have had a direct impact through the following campaigns and       events:            The National Housing Federation (NHF) Count us in campaign,         running from April 2012 - present, has used the research outputs,         specifically the comparative feedback tool, as one of their five pilot         schemes to reduce energy consumption.
They have also used the lessons         learnt from the CCC project to help them develop their monitoring         protocols.
A researcher from SBERG (J Cooper) is a member of the Count           us in Advisory Committee [5.2, 5.3].
A series of presentations and workshops at the NHF Conference         (06/07/2012); end of project conference (22/10/2012); and the Green         Vision webcast (29/03/2012) have raised awareness and stimulated         discussion amongst 109 social housing managers and built environment         professionals, on the role that behaviour change can play in reducing         energy consumption in social housing.
These events were considered "useful           to housing practitioners and can contribute to their and local           authorities objectives to reduce fuel poverty" by the Homes and         Communities Agency (HCA) [5.4] and provided "some very useful           examples of practical experiences" and "useful tools for           engaging with customers", according to participant feedback.
National policy makers     The research outputs from CCC were regularly fed back to policy advisors       from Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and the HCA.
The       research team made five presentations (05/07/12; 06/03/12; 13/09/11;       16/05/2011; 212/02/13) to DECC where the policy implications of the work       were presented and one presentation to HCA (22/10/12).
To date, the       outputs from Greenwich's part of the project have had a direct impact on       the policy discussions within HCA, in particular making "a significant         contribution to the implementation and design of government climate         change policy.
Specifically, it informs the implementation and design of         policy objectives to improve energy efficiency in order to reduce CO2         emissions, by exploring and understanding the issues that affect         occupiers' behaviour.
The focus on how occupiers use heating systems is         also highly relevant to the government's microgeneration strategy and to         the success of installations of eg heat pumps.
These aspects of         occupiers' behaviour and motivation are recognised as critically         important to achievement of policy objectives."
[5.4, 5.5]     Enhancing understanding and stimulating behaviour change amongst the         older community        The findings from the IDCOP project formed the basis of an EPSRC Public       Engagement project, `Sustainable Living and the Older Community' to engage       older people in sustainable living.
The project team worked with those       agencies trusted by the elderly (Age Concern, Energy Saving Trust and       Friends of the Elderly) to support behaviour change and stimulate interest       in climate change mitigation and adaptation solutions.
Over a 12 month       period (2009-2010) the project team had contact with: 38 people through       focus groups; 1,125 through formal presentations; 479 through information       stands and 79 through discussion groups.
In addition to face-to-face       engagement, articles in the Age Concern newsletter London Age were       sent to 15,050 people and information leaflets were available in Age       Concern centres.
In total 17,720 people were engaged with.
The impact of the engagement was measured using a methodology proposed by       the EPSRC for this type of activity.
A questionnaire was administered to       354 event attendees.
The impact analysis showed that:            awareness of sustainability had increased in 84% of respondents;       54% of respondents had taken action to change their behaviour (from         physical changes, to the fabric of their homes, to changes in consumer         behaviour)       57% of respondents had encouraged others to take action.
Overall the analysis showed the public engagement programme had a strong       (36%) or very strong (13%) impact on those engaged with [5.6, 5.7, 5.8].
