     Beneficiaries of the research:            EEA nationals accessing voluntary and community sector support via an         innovative,         research led approach focused on their needs through the provision of         non-statutory         interpreting services       Third sector organisations that have seen demand for their services by         non-/limited English         speakers rise in the past two years (e.g.
Booth Street Homeless Centre,         Rainbow Haven,         George House Trust, Revive)       Statutory / non-statutory welfare services staff who have had limited         experience and         training on working with interpreters (e.g.
adult social services         offices in Salford (Harpurhey         and Broughton offices), St Mary's children's oncology social work team,         Asylum team,         Moss Side)       Community groups: including established communities in Salford (e.g.
The Islington Estate         Tenants and Residents Association)       Home and international students of the University of Salford in the         context of volunteering         in the local community and student leadership (e.g.
mentoring)          The project has realised the following impact:            Participatory research with social workers in Manchester and Salford         has given service         providers a voice in describing their experiences in delivering services         through interpreter         mediation, identifying gaps in training; barriers to quality service         delivery through interpreter         mediation; insights into the impact of recent cuts to funding on the         organisation of         interpreter mediation (particularly in non-statutory services).
Qualitative analysis of the outcomes of the volunteer interpreter         project has allowed         adjustments to be made to training, scope and organisation of the         project, to ensure a         better fit with the beneficiary organisations and demonstrate a positive         impact of the project         on perceptions of service users from the indigenous population of         migrants from other         countries, especially EEA nationals.
The presence of EEA nationals as interpreters in the homeless centre         has helped to         improve perceptions of the indigenous population, some of whom view EEA         nationals as a         drain on resources.
Seeing educated and professionally-minded students         from EEA         countries in particular working in the centre has helped to give a more         balanced view of the         reasons people come to the UK.
The presence of the interpreters has also encouraged minority speakers         to engage with the         wider programme of social activities offered by the centre from which         they previously felt         excluded because of the language barrier.
Measuring the longer-term         impact on service         users of the project is currently in the planning stages.
The volunteer interpreter project has been able to establish a         mediating role in terms of         educating service providers on the need to use professional interpreters         for critical         interventions (to safeguard the service users and the volunteers), and         highlighting ways in         which a trainee interpreter can add value while developing skills and         knowledge in the field.
It has also identified areas for expansion and potential for         sustainability through a social         enterprise model.
The research work undertaken by Tipton in conjunction with the USCATs         project has         allowed the shifting socio-political realities to be explored in social         services, and for low-level         interventions in language mediation to be employed and evaluated.
The         USCATs         volunteer project has provided information relating to the difficulties         currently being         experienced on the ground by migrants with different socio-legal status.
Service provider views: "There are great benefits to our           service users, as they are able to           receive support and information in their own language and learn about           UK systems in order           to better understand how to access them.
Many of our service users are           very isolated and           have no one to talk to in their own language, so the interpreters also           help to break down           some of that isolation.
This in turn helps promote integration."
Rachel Foakes, Rainbow         Haven        "There are 10 countries in Eastern Europe who all have people in           the UK that are using our           services, but it isn't possible to employ a person with language           skills to talk to all of them as           the languages are very different and there is very little cross over.
I don't know of any other           centre which has access to such an important resource, we are very           lucky."
Amanda         Croome, Booth Centre Manager        Service user view: "We have had experience of working with           [D], from the University, she           helped us with various aspects of our life, including our housing           situation, Job Centre           appointments, benefits, looking for a job, translation of letters and           also with phone calls and           appointments."
Pawel S, Booth Centre        Project volunteer view: "It is crucial to the community to           diminish this gap between the           speakers of no or little knowledge of English and the authorities.
Integration plays a           significant role here: this unique project is part of enhancing the           social life not only for the           non-native English speakers but also for the locals and thus improving           everyday life."
