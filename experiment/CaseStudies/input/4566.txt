     Informing educational practice and raising achievement:     Burden's research and the `Myself as a Learner Scale' has had impact by       informing educational practice and raising the achievement of children in       over 300 schools so far in the UK and abroad.
MALS has been translated       into Chinese, Norwegian, French, Nepalese, Turkish and Malay, and used in       over fifty published evaluation studies across the world.
Burden has       worked in close partnership with Kestrel Education to link research on       MALS and self-concept1,2,3 to school improvement by creating       the growing `Thinking Schools' movement.
Kestrel Education is now the       leading organisation in the UK in the whole-school approach to the       teaching of thinking and `Thinking Schools'.
Using Burden's approach,       fourteen criteria were identified as indicative of whole school       effectiveness.
Any school producing a portfolio of evidence as to how it       meets these criteria can apply for formal accreditation as a `Thinking       School'.
To date (June 2013) 60 UK schools have successfully achieved       accreditation2 (41 primary; 19 secondary; plus one in New       Zealand, one in Australia and one in Thailand).
A recent survey of       accredited schools to which 26 schools responded found that 90% of the       headteachers, or their representatives, believed that the Burden's       Thinking Schools approach had raised attainment and had led to an       improvement in the quality of lessons.
Evidence in support of this was       offered from a range of sources including improved results on national       tests and examinations, consultations with pupils, observations of lessons       and comments from outside bodies including Ofsted.
Ofsted and Estyn       Inspection reports4 have frequently noted the impact of being a       Thinking School, an award given by Exeter after accreditation by Bob       Burden or one of his team.
One school's report notes that `Its identity         as a 'Thinking School' is at the heart of its work, whether it is         encouraging children to think about others or to think things out for         themselves' and another highlights that `The excellent progress         made by pupils in developing their thinking skills has a marked effect         on their personal development and the standards they attain.'
(Beechwood School, Ofsted, 2008, Unique Reference Number 111175).
Another       similar comment notes that: Ditton Primary is very proud of its         'Thinking School' status and this underpins every aspect of the school's         work.
The excellent progress made by pupils in developing their thinking         skills has a marked effect on their personal development and the         standards they attain.
(Spinney Avenue Primary, Ofsted 2007, Unique       Reference Number 111293 )     The Malaysian Government has been so impressed by the Thinking Schools       approach that they want all schools in Malaysia to become Thinking Schools       on the model outlined by Burden.
Burden has evaluated an initial pilot of       10 thinking schools including the use of MALS and the Graduate School of       Education at Exeter are now working with the Malaysian Ministry of       Education on the evaluation and support of 1000 schools working to become       thinking schools in 2013 with a further 9000 schools planning to join the       programme in 2014 (http://www.ithink.org.my/Home/Page/AboutUs).
The Vice President of the Malaysian agency charged with this enormous       endeavour affirms that: `Bob Burden's 'whole school approach' and his         criteria of success towards their evaluation, was a step in the right         direction for us and it has impacted positively on the programme thus         far'8.
Bob's Whole Thinking Schools approach is also influential in South Africa       where a new company has been formed to promote it: Thinking Schools South       Africa (TSSA).
TSSA has reached thousands of teachers through events and       seminars and is now working to train 15 schools, both primary and       secondary, as Thinking Schools in collaboration with Exeter who are       providing formative evaluation9.
The CEO of TSSA writes of Bob       Burden's influence: `The definition of a Thinking School and the         criteria for accreditation as set out by the University of Exeter are a         central reference point for our work'.
Informing policy change:     Burden's research has influenced dyslexia education policy change by       being invited to participate by Ed Balls in 2008 in the Brown Labour       Government sponsored Rose Review5 on the early identification       and teaching of dyslexic children.
Within the Rose Review itself reference       is made to Burden's work (Burden 1998 and Burden and Burdett, 2005) and to       the need for further teacher training that had been highlighted by Burden       and his colleagues.
Summary point 15, p.14/15 reads : "The review         notes that success with some children with the most severe literacy         problems can be elusive.
This makes it important for dyslexic guidance         to cover such matters as building children's confidence to counter         'learned helplessness' that may stem from repeated failure despite their         best efforts to learn to read."
and Summary point 36, p.21 reads : "...it         is essential for schools to engage parents in a constructive dialogue         about how, together, they can help the child overcome the difficulties         associated with dyslexia."
Para 5.56, p.123 makes specific reference       to Burden's research in making the following statement: "When         supporting children and young people cope with their difficulties         (Burden, 2005) schools will often have to support them on an emotional         as well as a cognitive level, if they are to fully overcome the         frustration, sense of shame, humiliation and anxiety which they may         face."
The Rose Review was published in 2009; the Government       accepted the review's findings and proposed that all of its       recommendations are implemented, including those proposed by Burden.
This       led to investing &#163;10 million embarking on a national programme to provide       4000 dyslexia specialist teachers; estimated to be one teacher to every 5       schools.
Use of research findings by professional bodies:     Specific mention is giving to Burden in the Association for Dyslexia       Specialists in Higher Education6 `Guidelines for Quality       Assurance in Specialist Support for Students with SpLDs in Higher       Education', `Professor Bob Burden commented (...) "All learning         includes three dimensions, namely, the cognitive dimension of knowledge         and skills, the psychodynamic dimension of motivation and emotions and         the social dimension of communication and cooperation"'.
As a result       of his work in the field Burden was co-opted as a Trustee of the British       Dyslexia Association and has also served as Chair of that organisation's       Accreditation Board which provides accreditation for all national dyslexia       teacher-training courses and all qualified teachers who have attended such       courses.
One direct result of his influence has been that all BDA       Accredited teacher-training courses have a requirement to highlight the       emotional, as well as literacy, needs of dyslexic students.
The CEO of the       BDA writes of his contribution: `It is not exaggerating to say that         without Bob's both quiet guidance and, at times, tireless energy, the         BDA would not be the positive force for people with dyslexia it is today'7     At an international level Burden's work has led to him being awarded an       accolade in 2012 by the International School Psychology Association (ISPA)       for his outstanding contribution to the application of psychology in       schools.
He was one of the organising committee of the International       Conference on Thinking held in the UK in 2007 and has subsequently played       a central role in establishing a UK version in conjunction with the       Kestrel/Thinking Schools International organisation which has attracted       several hundred delegates over the past few years.
