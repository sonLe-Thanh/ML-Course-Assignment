 Impact on Commerce A spinout company has been created and established its viability by generating revenue or profits: On the basis of high resolution by X-ray crystallographic structures of fragments that bound to protein targets carried out in the Blundell and Abell laboratories, a spinout company, Astex Technology Ltd, was created in 1999 (Company No.
03751674, incorporated 14/4/1999).
The university-based research provided the basis of all subsequent work in Astex, including approximately thirty "campaigns" against many targets, mainly of interest in fighting cancer.
In 2001 the University of Cambridge invested &#163;250k and was given equity in the company.
The company has signed deals in excess of $1.8bn (approximately &#163;1bn) between 1999 and 2011.
Investments in Astex have included Abingworth, Apax, Oxford (Boston), Advent, Alta and others with &#163;80 million equity in multiple financing rounds.
Astex has also had major collaborations, which involved investments of up to a total of &#163;25 million from GSK, Johnson and Johnson, Novartis and Astra Zeneca, of these the GSK investment occurred after 1/1/2008.1, LC1, LC2 In 2011 Astex Therapeutics was purchased by NASDAQ-listed oncology company SuperGen, Inc. for $150 million (ca &#163;100 million).
The new company was named Astex Pharmaceuticals, to reflect the strong brand name of Astex.LC1 Jobs have been created/protected: Over the past decade, the company has secured constant employment for between 70 and 120 workers in Cambridge.LC1 The current number of employees in the UK and US is ~120.
Highly skilled people have taken up specialist roles: Astex employs predominantly PhD students from industry and academia (including some from the Abell Group).
Employees from Astex have gone on to major roles in academia (Paul Wyatt, Director of the Drug Discovery Unit, Dundee), and industry (Miles Congreve, Vice President of Chemistry, Heptares).
Professor Abell was a member of the Astex Board from 1999 - 2000 and has been on its Scientific Advisory Board continuously since its foundation.LC1 A business or sector has adopted a new technology or process: Astex changed the way that drug discovery is carried out not only within its own labs but also in other small companies and large pharmaceuticals.
The former Head of Worldwide Discovery for Pfizer states: "As a consequence of Astex success, fragment-based approaches are common place throughout Pharma and Biotech, and the power of the technology is also recognised by academia and drug discovery institutes through the UK 3D Fragment consortium, for example.
While many companies have in-house capabilities, it is perhaps telling that GSK established a major fragment collaboration with Astex as their internal expertise was apparently not competitive.
Importantly, fragments may open the door to blocking protein-protein interactions which would lead to totally new classes of therapeutic agents designed to meet the medical needs of the 21st Century."
LC3 Most pharmaceutical companies now use fragment-based methods in early discovery.
They include J&amp;J, GSK and Astra Zeneca, all of whom have first collaborated with Astex; and UCB, Heptares and Evotec, where Astex employees and/or former members of the Abell and Blundell laboratories have moved to take posts.LC1 &amp; LC2 Impact on Health New clinical interventions have been developed: Astex has developed a strong pipeline2 and three drugs that were developed using the fragment-based approach (AT13387, an HSP90 inhibitor; AT7519M, a CDK inhibitor; and AT9283, a JAK/Aurora Inhibitor) are now in Phase II clinical trials for the conditions Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour (NCT01294202), Mantle Cell Lymphoma (NCT01652144), Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (NCT01652144) and Multiple Myeloma (NCT01145989).3,4,5,6 The same drugs have completed Phase I and are about to enter Phase II for other related clinical conditions (Multiple Myeloma (NCT01183949), Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NCT01712217), and Prostate Cancer (NCT01685268)), and in combination with other drugs.7,8,9 Early discovery candidates from Astex structure-guided fragment-based drug discovery that are now being taken forward in Phase I trials through collaborating companies include: FGFR Inhibitor JNJ 42756493 (NCT01703481, against Solid Tumours or Lymphoma, taken forward by Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC), CDK4 Inhibitor LEE011 (eg NCT01747876, against MRT and Neuroblastoma, taken forward by Novartis), PKB/Akt Inhibitor AZD 5363 (eg NCT01692262, against Prostate Cancer, taken forward by Astra Zeneca) and BACE Inhibitor AZD 3293 (eg NCT01795339, against Alzheimers, taken forward by Astra Zeneca).10
