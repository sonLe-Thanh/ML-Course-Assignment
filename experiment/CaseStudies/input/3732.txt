     Underpinning research at Swansea provided comprehensive evidence that       some genotoxic drugs       have thresholds for genotoxicity.
Two levels of international impact       resulted from this research: (1)       peace of mind offered to patients involved in the Viracept&#174; case       worldwide; (2) international       regulatory changes relating to low-level genotoxin contamination.
Reassuring patients who took contaminated Viracept&#174;C1.
Work at Swansea has had an impact       on 25,000 HIV-infected individuals in 29 countries who had received an       anti-viral medication       (Viracept&#174;) containing the genotoxic agent EMS [C2].
In 2007, Roche       reported that a batch of       Viracept&#174; had been contaminated with EMS during manufacture and withdrew       the drug from the       market [C1, C3].
This incited fears among HIV-infected individuals on       antiretroviral therapies:     "The recent recall of Roche's         antiretroviral drug Viracept&#174; has `created panic' among HIV-positive         people taking antiretrovirals in Zambia, some of whom believe that other         drugs might not be safe."
[C4]     Researchers at Swansea University had previously shown that the       genotoxicity of EMS had a       threshold dose.
Following detailed discussions with Jenkins and       colleagues, Roche launched an in         vivo study to investigate the genotoxic dose responses of EMS in a       mouse model.
According to       one of their main publications on the Viracept&#174; incident:     "a research group from the University of Swansea, UK, had published an         important article in this         context, which appeared in Cancer Research on 15 April 2007.
This         article .... yielded reliable         evidence for a threshold for chromosome damage and mutations induced by         EMS in a human         lymphoblastoid cell line in vitro.
These data encouraged Roche to         approach risk assessment for         Viracept&#174; patients."
[C9]     The Roche study confirmed that there was a threshold for the genotoxicity       of EMS in vivo.
The       newly defined threshold dose in mice allowed extrapolation to a safe human       exposure level.
This       revealed that the HIV-infected individuals taking the contaminated tablets       were not at increased       risk of mutagenesis (and hence cancer).
In July 2008, EMA accepted these       data as proof that       patients were not at an elevated risk of cancer [C2].
Hence, the impact of       the work was first felt in       2008.
Patients and professionals were informed of the decision and       therefore reassured in 2008.
Swansea's threshold work over the preceding 8 years was central to this       final decision.
Without       that original research on genotoxicity thresholds in vitro this       approach would not have been       envisaged by Roche: "The original work in vitro published by Shareen         Doak and colleagues in         Cancer Research in 2007 was the ultimate and indispensable trigger for         Hoffmann-La Roche to         enter further work in vivo to conduct a proper risk assessment         for HIV patients who have ingested         Viracept&#174; tablets contaminated for some period in 2007 with EMS.
Based         on the studies in vitro         conducted in Swansea under supervision of the late Prof Jim Parry, Roche         was successful in         proving a threshold in vivo ....
This reasoning was accepted by many         authorities around the world         after having been presented to the EU authorities in 2008."

This risk assessment allayed       the fears of the 25,000       individuals globally who had taken the contaminated tablets and allowed       their continued treatment       with these valuable anti-viral drugs [C3].
This also saved Roche from financial compensation claims and the cost of       setting up a patient       registry to monitor these 25,000 patients, two activities estimated to       cost more than $100 million.
Informing international regulatory policies     The impact of the acceptance of genotoxicity thresholds continues to be       felt in the updates to       regulations on safety assessments of drugs and chemicals.
For example, the       UK Government       Committee on Mutagenicity (COM)'s statement on thresholds for in vivo       mutagens [C5] and other       COM reports have cited threshold work from Swansea University [C6-7], and       the European Food       Standards Agency (EFSA) has issued a report on genotoxicity testing       strategies [C8] that also notes       the issue of thresholds and cites the pioneering research undertaken at       Swansea University.
Both       these advisory/regulatory bodies cite Swansea-led work as evidence for the       existence of thresholds       and propose accepting licensing of compounds with thresholded       genotoxicity.
Key members of the Swansea research team have also been invited to join       or lead policy shaping       mutagenicity committees [C10].
In 2009 Gareth Jenkins was invited to join       the UK Government's       Committee on Mutagenicity (COM) [C10]; in 2013 Shareen Doak was invited to       join COM [C10].
In       2012 George Johnson chaired the Genetic Toxicology Technical Committee       (GTTC) Quantitative       Work Group of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI).
These       activities have helped to       disseminate our key findings and to educate policy-makers about the       importance and relevance of       thresholds for genotoxicity.
