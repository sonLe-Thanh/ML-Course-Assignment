       The impact of this research has mainly been achieved through an         intensive process of engagement with a wide range of key international         non-academic stakeholder organisations.
HelpAge International (HAI): Our research facilitated HAI's         impact in this policy arena and affected HAI's own priorities in         numerous ways:       (i) HAI had not engaged with social pension issues before the first         research project, which played a critical role in establishing its         interest in this field.
The initial research idea was first conceived at         a meeting between Lloyd-Sherlock, Barrientos and Mark Gorman, then Chief         Executive of HAI [Impact Reference (IR)1].
HAI fed into the development         of the research proposal.
It agreed to be a formal partner in the         project and the subsequent 2008-9 study, and was involved in all stages         of the work.
(ii) The studies provided HAI with robust, credible data on social         pensions, which it used in policy engagement [IR 2, 3].
Lloyd-Sherlock         continues to engage with HAI weekly, both formally and informally,         advising and supporting its work on social pensions in multiple ways.
In         2009 he presented the results of the 2008/9 survey to a         specially-convened meeting of HAI social pension country officers, and         in 2012 he participated in a HAI expert meeting on income security in         old age.
The questionnaire used for the 2002 and the follow-up surveys         has been drawn on for the development of separate HAI surveys of older         people's wellbeing in countries such as Bolivia.
HAI is now recognised as the lead international organisation that has         driven the social pension agenda, with strong support from DFID and         working closely with national governments and other international         organisations (http://www.helpage.org/download/510158401a9cc/).Between         2007 and 2011 HAI significantly contributed to the implementation or         extension of social pension schemes in 18 developing countries,         affecting over 12 million older people.
According to the CEO of HAI,         2006-13:       `The longitudinal study on Brazil-South Africa social pensions in         particular has shaped our thinking on the inter-generational impacts of         social pensions - on older people and their families - and helped to         support the broader social protection agenda.
Peter and Armando's work         is well respected in the policy and donor community, and their studies         are regularly cited in key policy debates and policy consultation on         social protection' [IR4].
UN agencies: The finding that social pensions had similar effects       in different countries was of particular interest to the International       Labour Organisation (ILO).
According to an ILO Senior Social Security       Specialist, the research "strongly helped underpinning argumentation in       favour of non- contributory pensions...that a south-south learning       approach is feasible...and ideas to move on regarding solutions to similar       countries can be shared with similar benefit among developing countries"       [IR5] In 2011 Lloyd-Sherlock presented to a specially-convened social       protection seminar at the ILO HQ, Geneva.
Following the first study, Lloyd-Sherlock was lead author of the Global         Guide for the Implementation of the Madrid International Plan of Action         on Ageing, published by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs         in 2008 and circulated to all UN member states [IR6].
In 2010/11         Lloyd-Sherlock was seconded to WHO, in part to develop strategies         linking social pensions to interventions to enhance older people's         health [IR 7].
DFID was both a funder and a non-academic stakeholder in the         2001-3 study.
In 2011-2012 Lloyd- Sherlock was engaged by DFID as a         Senior Research Fellow, partly to advise on social protection issues         including social pensions.
According to the Senior Social Development         Adviser, (DFID), the research:       "showed that DFID pensions can be an effective entry point to reducing         the economic vulnerability and poverty of whole households....it         evidenced social pensions/cash transfers for older persons, particularly         women, as a less politically contentious route into wider benefits for         entire households.
It also alerted DFID to the need to understand the         effects of pensions within a wider social development context....The         fact that DFID then engaged Peter Lloyd-Sherlock as a research fellow         ensured that the evidence coming out of this research contributed to         DFID's wider understanding (research) and application (policy) of         inter-generational or life course approaches to reducing poverty and         vulnerability" [IR8].
The governments of Brazil and South Africa have both been receptive to         the research findings, with invited presentations to government         agencies.
For example, in 2011 South Africa's Department of Social         Development devoted a four hour meeting attended by over 400 officers to         a presentation by Lloyd-Sherlock and the study team.
