     The impact of the Sheffield chemoinformatics work in terms of increasing       economic prosperity for the pharmaceutical industry and increasing the       range of medicines available to patients has been two-fold: by means of       software developed in Sheffield and then distributed to industry; and by       means of extensive industrial adoption of algorithms and methods published       by the group in the open literature.
The reach of the work is demonstrated       by its current use throughout the pharmaceutical industry and the       significance by its role in helping to discover new drugs that can benefit       patients throughout the world.
GOLD has been distributed by CCDC since 1998 and is currently used for       pharmaceutical research in over 50 different countries:             "For many years, GOLD has been one of the top two protein-ligand           docking programs for industrial and academic research in drug           discovery, and is used by around 60 major pharmaceutical companies and           more than 600 Universities worldwide" [S2];        "My group of 18 modellers and chemoinformaticians are actively           involved in the support of many drug discovery projects; our work has           led to the discovery of several novel chemical entities now in the           clinic or on the market.
One of the tasks we perform is virtual           screening of large databases of chemical structure, and for that           purpose we regularly use GOLD as the tool of choice" [S3].
GASP has been distributed by Tripos since 1996, with an enhanced version       available since 2003, and GALAHAD has been distributed by them since 2005.
These three products have been very successful commercially, with total       sales to date of ca.
&#163;7 million and with royalties to the University of       Sheffield of ca.
&#163;900K (&#163;82K in 2008-12).
The software licensees include       many of the world's leading chemical companies, with, e.g., GASP and       GALAHAD users including Amgen, Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers       Squibb, DuPont, Eli Lilly, Genentech, GSK, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi Aventis       and Syngenta inter alia.
License holders such as these have made very extensive use of the       software, as demonstrated by published accounts in the scientific       literature of the use of GALAHAD, GASP and GOLD in companies' internal       drug-discovery projects.
WoS searches in October 2013 for the six       references listed in Section 3 reveals over 250 citations to this research       by industrial companies in 2008-13.
For example, articles in two leading       medicinal chemistry journals (Journal of Medicinal Chemistry       (IF=5.38) and Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry (IF=3.15))       describe the use of the Sheffield software by world-leading pharmaceutical       companies to support research in cancer (Genentech), heart disease (Pfizer       and Proctor &amp; Gamble), cellular signalling (GSK), cognitive impairment       such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's (Abbott), and obesity (Takeda) inter         alia.
The impact of the Sheffield work is much broader than just the three       specific commercial products, in that techniques described by the       Sheffield group in the open literature have been widely adopted, as       evidenced both by literature citation and by incorporation in software       that is used around the world on a daily basis.
For example:             "We also follow the work of the Sheffield group keenly and we have           adopted some of their ideas on data fusion techniques and           multi-objective optimization into our own code; we have done this more           with the research coming out of this department than we have with any           other academic cheminformatics group in Europe " [S3];        "Sheffield research has been at the heart of all the commonly           used, indispensable systems for handling chemical reactions, and 2D,           3D and generic chemical structures in industry.....Very few           universities worldwide are capable of addressing the "virtual R&amp;D"           problem; Sheffield is the leader" [S4].
