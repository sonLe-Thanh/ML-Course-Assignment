     Nature and varieties of impact     Stowell's research has made a decisive contribution towards       transforming performances of music of the `long 18th century' worldwide in       terms of string techniques, style and general performance practice issues.
Through collection and interpretation of the wide range of raw evidence       with which musicians must engage when creating HIPs of music of that       period, he has provided performers with the wherewithal to create       historically more accurate interpretations, and audiences with the       knowledge to comprehend and appreciate the new insights revealed.
As       sources cited in section 5 will corroborate, the traditional method of       influence by scholarly publication has consistently been supplemented by       other avenues - pre-concert talks on HIP issues, open practice-based       workshops, public study days, public lectures, performance and commercial       recording consultancies, concerts (some as soloist/director and       presenter), broadcasts, contributions to professional journals (e.g.
The         Strad), and programme notes for major festivals/venues (e.g.
Edinburgh International Festival; London's South Bank).
For example, Stowell       was invited to speak at the OAE's public Study Day (28 February, 2010,       Purcell Room, London) on account of `his highly regarded research and work       in the field of performance practice.
'5.2 The annual event is       `an integral part of the OAE's Residency at the Southbank and aims to       assist with engaging our audience in the background behind OAE's concerts       and stimulate further thought and discussion.
'5.2 Stowell's       talk (`Performance practice in Beethoven') underpinned the OAE's       performances that season of Beethoven's symphonies and Violin Concerto in       the UK and abroad.
He also participated in a round table discussion,       sharpening the historical awareness of OAE players and enriching the       knowledge and understanding of a capacity audience of c.400.
Impact via Commercial Recordings: Kopatchinskaja's Beethoven     Stowell has influenced playing styles through commercial recording       collaborations with Moldavian violinist Patricia Kopatchinskaja (Beethoven's         Complete Works for Violin and Orchestra (Orchestre des       Champs-Elys&#233;es/Philippe Herreweghe (Na&#239;ve, V5174, 2009)) and American       Jacqueline Ross (music by Schubert (Naxos 9.70164 and 9.70182, 2012/13)),5.4       and he has advised other period violinists such as Lucy van Dael       (Holland).
Ann Cnop (Belgium), Christoph Koncz (Austria), Kitty Cheung       (Hong Kong), Margaret Faultless (UK) and Adrian Butterfield (UK), as well       as conductors Sir Mark Elder, Roy Goodman, Sir Charles Mackerras, and Sir       Roger Norrington.
Impact in the current REF period is most clearly exemplified by the       reception of Kopatchinskaja's recording, for which she used Stowell's       monograph3.2 as a principal source of guidance.5.7 Stowell       also advised on HIP issues, made critical appraisals of preliminary       `takes' and wrote supporting liner notes.5.1 He prompted       Kopatchinskaja to interpret the evidence from new perspectives, his       `insight' and `expert advice'5.1 focusing on matters of text,       tempo, technique and style, including details of the playing style of       Franz Clement, who premiered the work.
The novel insights of the resultant       recording challenged traditional readings and were very favourably       received, The CD was proclaimed BBC Music Magazine's Orchestral       Disc 2010 for its `imagination and invention' and its `fresh and exciting       interpretation of a familiar work'       [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHW1HCrMFpI,         between 04'09" and 04'50"] and was hailed as `one of the most       stimulating and provocative [of Beethoven's work] that has ever been       committed to disc.
'5.6 It was also highly commended in BBC       Radio 3's `Building a Library' (4 April 2011), critics acknowledging that       `Kopatchinskaja has something genuinely individual to say'5.8       and has made `the best "authentic" version so far'.5.1[Tully       Potter, The Strad, December 2009] Its commercial success - 20,000+       copies sold by April 2013 - has had important ramifications both for the       Na&#239;ve label's classical music outputs and Kopatchinskaja's career.5.1       She was immediately headhunted by Harrison/Parrott artists' agency, which       has widened considerably the ambit of her solo, broadcasting and recording       activities, especially in HIP.
She has been engaged as artist-in-       residence for the Beethovenfest (Bonn, 2013) to perform, among       other works, Beethoven's Violin Concerto.
Stowell's Beethoven       research has also been embraced by other virtuoso violinists worldwide,       notably Pekka Kuusisto and Isabelle Faust.5.1     Impact via Pedagogical and Professional Practice     Stowell's research has also impacted on non-specialist       practitioners through his links with the Associated Board of the Royal       Schools of Music (ABRSM).
He contributed to its series of `Performers'       Guides', aimed at its `own constituency of students!and their teachers -       not to mention examiners!
'3.5 Further, his co-authored volume       (with Lawson) on HIP3.2 has served as a recommended specialist       text for university and conservatoire programmes in performance practice       worldwide as well as for the ABRSM's LRSM and FRSM diploma examinations,       influencing performance practices globally and making a major cultural       impact on public awareness and understanding of changing performing       traditions in music of the period.5.9     Stowell's publications have provided an important information       resource for numerous conductors and performers who have espoused HIP,       influencing their interpretations from various technical and       interpretative standpoints, filtering into the performances of modern       symphony orchestras and broadening the listening tastes of the wider       community.
Knowledge has also been transferred through Stowell's       own professional activities as a violinist, whether as soloist or       presenter/director in concert or in HIP workshops with professional       players, students and youth orchestras throughout Wales (including the       NYO), supported by The Arts Council of Wales.5.5     Both AHRC-funded projects with which Stowell has been associated       have achieved impact through knowledge transfer, encouraging the       development of relevant performing skills and providing scholars,       performers and the listening public with fresh and stimulating insights       into the performance of works central to the canon of western art-music.
For example, as mentor to Holden, Stowell has consistently       offered theoretical and practical advice regarding the substance and       content of her scholarly, outreach and public engagement activities and       her project's website.5.2 In addition to academic       beneficiaries, research outcomes have already impacted on present and       future generations of professional string players (via OAE study days,       workshops at UK and European conservatoires and public seminars/lectures),       conductors, ensembles, and the wider performing and listening communities.
