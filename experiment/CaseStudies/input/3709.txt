     iCeGS' work has been influential in policy development both in the UK and       overseas.
iCeGS has a commitment to engagement with the sector and to       maximising impact through four main strategies:             Commitment to open access/online sharing.
The Centre has         invested in the maintenance and development of its website.
The website         serves as a resource base for the sector and features a regular news         update and a monthly synthesis of research information and policy         developments.
The Centre's website receives an average of 50,000 hits         per year.
The Centre works with funders and publishers to make as much         material freely available online as possible through the UDORA research         archive.
Staff are encouraged to develop their social media profiles, to         engage in blogging and to share their research with networks of         practitioners and policy makers.
Practitioner engagement.
The Centre maintains a database of         over 3000 practitioner contacts and communicates with them regularly         through research projects and through a monthly email newsletter.
Staff         are regularly invited to speak at events organised by key professional         bodies such as the Career Development Institute.
Engagement of intermediaries.
The Centre works closely with key         intermediary bodies that sit between practitioners and policy makers.
These include professional organisations, employer bodies, for example         Careers England and the Education and Employers Taskforce, and a range         of government and third sector bodies, such as the UKCES, LSIS, EHRC and         HEFCE.
In many cases, these intermediary bodies fund iCeGS' research to         enable the Centre to input into the policy development process.
Direct engagement with policy makers.
iCeGS maintains direct         relationships with policy makers in local and national government.
This         activity includes conducting directly commissioned research, regular         meetings with key civil servants and politicians, and contributing to         policy consultations and enquiries.
Examples of Impact:     UK: Following the formation of the Coalition Government in 2010,       the Head of iCeGS met with civil servants in the Department of Business,       Innovation and Skills and the Department for Education to discuss the       evidence base around careers work and input into the emergent policy.
This       included participating in a DfE seminar on the evidence base and reviewing       the DfE's internal paper.
Engagement with Government has continued with       staff from the Centre continuing to meet with representatives of       government departments and agencies (HEFCE, Skills Funding Agency, UKCES       etc.)
While the Centre has sought to build a productive engagement with       government, the direction of policy has run counter to the evidence base.
Consequently, the Centre has published a number of research papers which       have been critical of government policy.
These have frequently been       undertaken in close consultation with key policy stakeholders in this area       (Unison, the Career Development Institute, the Career Sector Strategic       Forum).
This research has resulted in both media coverage and further       involvement in the policy sphere.
The Head of Centre was appointed as the       Specialist Adviser to the Education Select Committee Inquiry into Career       Guidance for Young People and met with the Labour Party shadow ministers       responsible for career guidance.
iCeGS Staff have been asked to input       specialist expertise to HEFCE and Offa to help shape strategy for widening       participation and the Skills Funding Agency in the construction of the new       procurement arrangements for the National Careers Service.
Europe: Three staff from the Centre have been involved in       providing expertise and consultancy to the European Lifelong Guidance       Policy Network since its foundation in 2007.
This body brings together       policy-makers from across Europe to develop lifelong guidance policy and       practice.
Sri Lanka: The Centre was invited to contribute to the Education       for Knowledge Society Project funded by the Asia Development Bank in 2011.
Siobhan Neary led the career guidance strand which developed a cohesive       and coherent approach to career guidance in schools.
This included the       establishment an Advisory Committee, a National Action Committee and an       inter-ministerial mechanism so that careers work in schools could benefit       from coordination with careers services provided by other government       ministries.
The Centre then supported implementation of these policies       through training and the development of a practitioner focused website.
Canada: The Centre has built links with policy makers and key       stakeholders in Canada.
In August and September 2011, the Head of iCeGS       has been invited to speak at conferences in Canada and to meet with key       provincial policy makers in New Brunswick, Ontario and Alberta.
The Centre       was funded by a Canadian company to produce a critical review of the       evidence base around careers education and guidance.
This has then been       used by stakeholders and policy makers in the development of a new Ontario       policy on career education and guidance.
