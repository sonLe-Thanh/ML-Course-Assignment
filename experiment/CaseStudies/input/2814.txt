     This policy-relevant research generated a range of demonstrable impacts       in terms of both reach and significance.
From 2009 onwards the impact of       the global financial crisis increased the political salience of this       research as governments &#8212; within and beyond the UK &#8212; looked for new ways       of reducing bureaucratic waste and getting value for money.
At the 2010       General Election all three of the main political parties included a       commitment to reduce and reform the sphere of delegated governance and, as       outlined below, Flinders' research was to prove highly influential in       setting out an evidence-based reform agenda.
In supporting this claim, the       senior civil servant responsible for public bodies' reform in the Cabinet       Office has acknowledged that research by Flinders `helped to define         the climate in which reform of public bodies became inevitable' and       that his research `continues to play a decisive role in shaping the         future of the Government's policy on public bodies'.
[see S1 below].
The Policy Analyst to the House of Lords Committee on the Constitution,       has similarly written that `Prof. Flinders' impact on the committee's         inquiries has gone beyond the mere elucidation of subject matter &#8212; his         submissions have on occasion shaped the conclusions and even the         structures of the committee's own reports.'[S2].
A direct research-application-impact relationship can be demonstrated       through a range of channels.
The most influential example was instigated       by Flinders' collaboration with the Institute for Government and the       production of a report &#8212; Read Before Burning [S3] &#8212; in July 2010,       which presented the main research findings (listed in Section 2 above) and       argued in favour of wide-ranging review and reform.
This report was the       focus of a large number of media reports and subsequently formed the main       reference point for the Public Administration Select Committee's Smaller         Government: Shrinking the Quango State [S4] report of January 2011.
Flinders' research &#8212; either directly through his memorandum of       evidence to the inquiry, or indirectly through his involvement       with the Institute for Government's report &#8212; was referenced seventeen       times in the select committee's final report [S4] and led to specific       recommendations that were subsequently accepted in the Government's formal       response (paragraph 52) in March 2011.
The Chairman of the House of       Commons Public Administration Select Committee, has written of `the         very clear and significant impact that Matthew Flinders has achieved in         recent years...
If asked for a clear and demonstrable example of the       actual impact of his contribution I would point you to         the Public Administration Select Committee's report &#8212; Smaller         Government: Shrinking the Quango State &#8212; of January 2011...the influence         of Prof. Flinders' research and writing is obvious within the text of         the final report.
Indeed, many of the actual recommendations made by the         committee are actually explicitly linked to either his written         submission of evidence or to points he made when appearing in front of         the committee...It is refreshing to see an academic that is so engaged         and visible within Whitehall and Westminster [emphasis in the       original]' [S5].
Beyond the direct example given above, the impact of Flinders' research       findings were much wider, as evidenced by the fact that the UK Parliament       website returns over one-hundred references to Flinders' `quango-related'       research in either select committee reports or House of Commons Research       Papers (January 2008 - June 2013).
Flinders made a number of       research-based recommendations that he fed into policy discussions either       through evidence to parliamentary inquiries (see, for example, House of       Commons Treasury Select Committee [S6], House of Commons Public       Administration Committee [S4], House of Commons Liaison Committee [S7],       House of Lords Committee on the Constitution [S8] and through media work       (see.
for example, The Times 11 December 2009, The Guardian       31 March 2010, Yorkshire Post, 5 November 2010), practitioner       magazines (see, for example, Holyrood, October 2010; Public         Service Magazine, February 2012; The House, May 2012) or       through think-tank working papers between 2008 and 2010 (four practitioner       papers were published by the Institute for Government).
Flinders' recommendations included the need to undertake a fundamental       review of all public bodies, the need to institute mechanisms for       cross-government training and support in relation to sponsorship, the need       to enhance the capacity of the Cabinet Office vis-&#224;-vis public       bodies, the recommendation to establish a Centre of Excellence for Public       Appointments in the Cabinet Office.
The on-going impact of this work was recognised in 2010 when Flinders was       invited to contribute to the official history of the Office of the       Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA) and when the Cabinet Secretary       and Head of the Civil Service, Sir Gus O'Donnell, used his speech at the       2011 OCPA Annual Conference to state `Whitehall needs more academics         like Professor Flinders...real research written in an accessible         language'.
Later in 2011, Flinders was invited by the Foreign and       Commonwealth Office to contribute to its `Supporting Democracy Programme'       working with the government of Thailand to institute a transparent and       merit-based public appointments system.
This involved meetings with       ministers, regulators and civil society representatives; a lecture to the       Senate of Thailand; and a subsequent delegation of Thai Senators and       officials visiting the UK to meet the Commissioner for Public Appointments       and to learn more about the regulation of public appointments in the UK.
As a result of this knowledge-exchange Thailand is now in the process of       implementing measures that draw from UK experience.
Flinders' research also contributed to and informed reforms by the       coalition government across the areas of research highlighted in section       2.
These being: (i) the capacity of the Cabinet Office in relation to       agencies and public bodies was immediately increased after May 2010; (ii)       the annual document `Public Bodies' was re-issued using a more complete       and comprehensive methodology and typology; (iii) a new set of internal       control measures were introduced to tighten the relationship between       departments and arm's-length bodies; (iv) new procedures were put in place       to control the creation of new agencies, board and commissions; and (v)       the public appointments framework was fundamentally reviewed and reformed.
The outcome is a set of reforms that can be demonstrably traced back to a       core research foundation including: a fundamental review of all public       bodies which drew upon Flinders' initial analysis; a reform process that       sought to simplify the complex institutional landscape that Flinders had       mapped; the creation of a new and strengthened `Public Bodies Team' within       the Cabinet Office; the publication of Public Bodies 2012 that       includes a revised version of Flinders' `Russian Doll Model' representing       various degrees of delegation through which the `drift' of functions       across a `spectrum of autonomy' can be shown.
Flinders' approach was:       promoted by the Institute for Government and referred to by the Cabinet       Office in its report on Public Bodies published in 2012 (p.70);       evident in the creation of a Sponsorship Network across Whitehall (to       which Flinders was invited to speak in January 2012 and October 2013); and       the creation of a new Centre for Excellence on Public Appointments within       the Cabinet Office.
This research continues to develop momentum with       Flinders acting as a keynote speaker (alongside the Head of the Civil       Service) to outline the findings and implications of his on-going research       for agencies at the International Association of Agency Chief Executives       (Dublin, May 2013) and at the Annual Conference of the UK Association of       Chief Executives (London, June 2013).
His research on public bodies reform       is now being developed in the Republic of Ireland in the form of a Public       Service Fellowship (held by Dr Muiris Macarthaigh) in the Irish       government's Department for Expenditure and Reform.
Overall, the depth and       breadth of this impact led a senior civil servant from the Cabinet Office       to highlight that: `Underpinning Professor Flinders' work is his         impressive and atypical ability to adapt his research and modes of         communication to different audiences.
I believe this is a critical         factor that enables him to play such an important role in contemporary         policy-making' [S1].
The continued reach and significance of Flinders' research for a wide       range of user communities within and beyond the UK is evident in the       citation of his submissions of evidence by the House of Lords Committee on       the Constitution as part of its inquiry into the `Pre-emption of       Parliament', January 2013 (HL 165, 2013) and the Public Administration       Select Committee as part of its inquiry into `The Committee on Standards       in Public Life' (HC 516, 2013).
The quality and impact of this research       has been recognised with the 2012 Communicator of the Year award       by the Political Studies Association (PSA) and in 2013 with an ESRC         Impact Prize with the commendation noting that Flinders' research:       `has underpinned government policy and his writing and broadcasting have       stimulated major public debates within and beyond the UK'.
