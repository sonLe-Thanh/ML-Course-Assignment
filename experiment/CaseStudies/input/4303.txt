     Impact 1: Enhanced public appreciation of a widened canon of 19th-century         German literature     The project has impacted on public engagement with the 19th-century       German novel and its heritage.
As the only editing project on this author       that is currently available, it has redefined Gutzkow's place in the       literary canon, transformed public access and raised Gutzkow's public       profile.
The project website was launched 22 Jan 2001.
From January 2008       to June 2011, it is calculated from earlier figures that the site received       more than 3,000 hits.
In July 2011 a new counter was installed, which       reveals 4,750 hits from that date to 30 July 2013 (5.3), suggesting       increasing interest as the number of texts and commentaries available has       expanded.
Evidence of this transformed public profile can be found in the       press.
Germany's leading daily broadsheet Frankfurter Allgemeine         Zeitung, which has a daily circulation of approximately 362,000 and       the highest distribution abroad of any German broadsheet, highlighted       Gutzkow's relevance for today's readers on Gutzkow's bicentenary, 17 March       2011, stressing his `concept for a modern novel'.
In addition, the project       has revolutionised the Gutzkow corpus, placing journalistic texts and       critical commentaries alongside his more widely-known literary works for       the first time.
(a) Media Reports (Press and Radio)     When the project was first launched, non-academic reviews appeared in the       international press, which highlighted the innovative nature of its peer       editing and the re-location of Gutzkow in the public sphere rather than       specialist literary domains; these aspects continue to attract interest in       articles of leading papers up to the present day (5.7, 5.8), which       call the concept behind the edition `ingenious' (5.7).
In 2008, an article in the leading German weekly newspaper Die Zeit       (distribution of 500,000), took the publication of Gutzkow's influential       novel Der Zauberer von Rom as a welcome opportunity to celebrate       the fact that Gutzkow's `remarkable novels were being made available       again' and this time for a wider audience and with a commentary (5.8).
The 2011 Gutzkow bicentenary was a further catalyst for public engagement       with Gutzkow.
Vonhoff and Lauster's 3.5 is the foundation of the       project.
This, together with the 9 volumes published so far (one of which       is in its 2nd edition), is acknowledged in the leading Swiss       daily Tages-Anzeiger (distribution of 550,000) (5.7).
The       article refers to the `innovative concept of an "edition in progress",       which uses the internet to produce publications that are financially       affordable and are at the same time of the highest scholarly standard'.
The columnist highlights the importance of the commentaries, `as without       them readers will not be able to understand the works adequately any       longer'.
Project member Ute Schneider was also interviewed by a regional German       radio programme on SWR2, a culture channel produced for Baden-W&#252;rttemberg       and Rheinland-Pfalz, but broadcast nationwide with an estimated audience       of 300,000 per day (5.9).
She was asked about the conference in       Mainz that celebrated Gutzkow's bicentenary, and acknowledged the role the       Gutzkow edition has played for the revival of the author.
(b) Non-academic Readers     The project's combination of edited texts available in print and online,       alongside the documents and commentaries published exclusively online, has       proved particularly successful in drawing the attention of non-academic       users.
There has been a sea-change in readers' perceptions of Gutzkow.
Readers' testimonies comment on peer editing; for example, a member of the       Redaktion SPRACHKUNST made a suggestion for additional material in October       2009, and praised `the great potential' he saw in `the interactive online       approach for commentaries' (5.2).
A scientist reader from CERN (the       European Organization for Nuclear Research), Switzerland, contacted the       project leaders in July 2008 with information about a reading of Gutzkow's       novel Die Ritter vom Geiste in the "Klassikerforum", an online       reading group (5.2, 5.4).
Between 31/5/2008 and 24/9/2008 these       forum users produced more than 15 pages of comments on their reading       experience (5.4).
Contributions include a general recognition of       the importance of the novel as well as the author, the discussion of       individual characters, and the frustration about not having a reliable       edition of it easily available.
A web counter shows more than 35,000 hits       in this exchange between non-professional readers over this period, and       the exchange led to direct approaches to various members of the project       team.
Other users of the edition contributed to the open-question section       of the edition.
For the bicentenary, Vonhoff, alongside other leading researchers in the       field, was invited to contribute two essays to the popular and       highly-regarded online literary magazine literaturkritik.de (5.5).
The March 2011 issue was dedicated specifically to Gutzkow.
Together the       two articles have been visited by 4,337 readers between 11 March 2011 and       30 July 2013.
The project is also referenced on a literary blog in December 2010 (5.6);       the popularity of this blog in general is evidenced by its web counter       which shows more than 900,000 hits since July 2010.
(c) Arts Organizations / Libraries and Archives     A member of the Landesarchiv Baden-W&#252;rttemberg informed the project of a       newly discovered letter exchange (May 2009) (5.2).
From 2008 to 2013, the Universit&#228;tsbibliothek Johann Christian       Senckenberg (Frankfurt/Main), which holds the literary estate of Gutzkow,       spent 19,826 Euros on the conservation and restauration of archived       letters to and from the author (21,500 pages), a direct consequence &#8212; as       the Director of the Manuscript Department attested &#8212; of the increased       interest in and usage of these holdings (5.1).
Impact 2: Request for full integration into a linguistic database of         principal German texts from 1600 to 1900     In October 2012, the Deutsches Textarchiv in Berlin       (Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften), an       interdisciplinary linguistic digitization project, requested access to the       texts of the Gutzkow edition with the aim of fully integrating the results       of the editorial work on Gutzkow's texts within their linguistically       annotated public database.
After negotiations and a general agreement with       the publically financed body in early 2013 (5.10), first texts were       made available in the testing section DTAQ (currently 265 registered       users) of the DTA in January 2013.
The linguistic portal of the DTA, where       the texts finally will be made accessible, currently has more than 11,000       visitors with approx.
100,000 page hits per month.
The collaboration is       ongoing.
