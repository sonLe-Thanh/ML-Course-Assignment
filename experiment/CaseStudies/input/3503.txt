     Conclusions drawn from studies into designing out burglary are detailed       in a series of UK national policy documents which contain recommendations       to build new homes to the SBD specification.
Compliance with this standard       has resulted in 350,000 SBD homes being developed in the UK and,       consequently, a reduction in burglary rates of about 60% in homes designed       and built to this standard.
Our ACC research is referenced throughout the       Home Office/DCLG's Planning Guidance document Safer           Places: The Planning System and Crime Prevention1,       published in 2004 and guiding current practice.
The nineteen references to       the work undertaken by the ACC are used as evidence of the crime risk of       individual or combined design features within residential housing, and       support the recommendations contained within the guidance.
A senior member       of the Home Office Designing Out Crime Unit has indicated that Armitage's       work shaped this guidance, which was cited as good practice in two of the       UK government's subsequent Planning Policy Statements which local       authorities are required to follow when building new homes.
The       testimonial2 clearly outlines the beneficial impact of the ACC       research: "The work undertaken by Huddersfield was used to shape the         guidance set out in Safer Places &#8212; which in turn was then         referenced as a source of good practice in other documents.
For example         Safer Places was referenced as a source of government policy aimed at         promoting better quality of place in the then Government's strategy on         World Class Places (2009); and was referenced in Home Office evidence to         the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee's evidence check on         lighting (also 2009).
In 2010 both Safer Places and Secured By Design         (SBD) were referenced as sources of additional information on crime         prevention in the DCLG publication: Guidance on information requirements         and validation".
Both Safer Places and SBD were highlighted       in 2010 as crime prevention measures in DCLG's Guidance           on Information Requirements and Validation for Local Authority           Planning Departments.
This document required local authorities       to take SBD into account when submitting Design and Access Statements.
The       Home Office continues to act on Huddersfield's research into designing out       crime.
In 2010/11, they drew on ACC figures demonstrating lower burglary       rates in SBD developments2 as "indicative data to use in         modelling when shaping thinking about home security".
This testimony       also emphasises the importance of the ongoing impact of the research: "Last         (but most certainly not least &#8212; we continue to work with both Design         Council/CABE and with DCLG on how best to promulgate and promote your         most recent research findings and case studies".
The ACC research was presented as evidence by the Homes and Communities       Agency to support the recommendation that all Housing Association       properties should meet SBD standards.
This evidence was first used in the       Housing Corporation's standards specification, which remained active until       April 2008.
The research, similarly, informed the Design           and Quality Standards3 that superseded it.
These       standards, again, contained a recommendation that homes should be built to       the SBD specification.
The research was referenced in a currently active       English Partnerships guidance document.
It cites Armitage's findings (page       10) as evidence of the need for regeneration projects to follow SBD       principles, and has been adopted as the building standard for developments       where the Agency has a land interest.
It was also referenced in Home       Office evidence to the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee on       street lighting safety2.
A letter       published in The Times (23/10/13), written by Armitage and signed       by 69 national and international experts, has challenged current       Government proposals for relaxing SBD standards.
The ACC research demonstrating the effectiveness of SBD has been key to       ACPO's drive to advance SBD nationally as an evidence-based policy.
In       2010, ACPO released a report       on using Design and Access Statements to reduce crime through SBD, citing       our 2009 research, with a comment on page nine about the importance of the       ACC work led by Armitage on Designing Out Crime).
ACPO used Armitage's       research as the evidence base for its Parliamentary Memorandum submitted       to the Department for Communities and Local Government in 2008, which       argued successfully for SBD to remain within the Code           for Sustainable Homes.
Subsequently, the Director and General       Manager at ACPO commented4 that it "was rare not to make         some reference &#8212; main or in passing &#8212; to the work by Dr Armitage" in       his many presentations, interviews and publications on designing out       crime.
He also stated that "The results of the work by Rachel Armitage         have been used in the practical application by crime prevention         practitioners, builders, security industry manufacturers and planning         officers for whom the day to day work denies the time to research the         subject deeply.
We are linked to around 300 police practitioners         throughout the UK all of whom work from our material to promote CPTED         and SBD and all have copies of the SBD research".
This testimony       acknowledges the key role of the ACC of first bringing SBD into the policy       agenda and helping to drive forward eventual large-scale implementation: "When         Rachel Armitage undertook her research into SBD in West Yorkshire this         was the first truly independent test of the SBD theory and practice.
The         second piece of work with Leanne Monchuk took account of the technical         developments in the project and reinforced the benefits.
Following each         piece of research Rachel was able to present the findings in a clear,         detailed way which identified the range of benefits and answered logical         questions about gentrification, displacement and crime switch.
These         points were not obvious in the original project.
She and Leanne have         presented to national police CPD training audiences and to regional and         commercial events.
The work has been quoted in many other reports and         publications and has been taken as read in the rationale for         publications such as Safer Places &#8212; the planning system and crime         prevention."
The Director of ACPO estimated, as mentioned in this       testimony, that at least 350,000 houses have been built to SBD standards       since 2007.
The ACC research both provided the evidence which motivated       implementation of this approach and shaped the detailed specification of       its standards.
Similarly, the National Policing Lead for Crime Prevention       provided a letter5 in August 2013 stating that staff "working         in the field of Designing Out Crime constantly use your [ACC] work         to justify changes they make to developments, creating `safer' places         for our communities to live".
He considered this contribution to       housing and crime reduction policies to be particularly important in       difficult economic times: "In times of recession, where governments and         organisations are constantly striving to cut costs, it is comforting to         know that evidence provided by you and your fellow academics makes a         compelling case to continue using effective security to make our         communities more socially sustainable".
The ACC research into the link between housing quality and crime has been       used to revise the Building for Life housing award.
The author of the       standard has stated6 that the re-write reflected their learning       from Armitage's research: "In practice, the research was used by         Design Council [formerly CABE] to inform the revamp of Building         for Life.
Building for Life is the most widely used design quality tool         for residential development in the planning system in England and has a         user base of local planning authorities, design consultants and house         builders".
As well as shaping national and international policy (see below) on       designing out crime, the ACC research has had widespread impact on the       practices of local authorities and police forces.
For example, Thames       Valley Police used Armitage's research to support its 2010 Compendium           of Crime Prevention and Reduction in The Planning System7.
Thames Valley Police have stated that Armitage's research was instrumental       in providing the evidence which led to them increasing the number of crime       prevention design advisors in the force from four to ten in 2008, and that       the Compendium remains at the forefront of the team's policies and       procedures, with police and local authority planning departments       frequently referring to these principles within their policy and practice.
Similar testimonies have been received from other areas of the UK.
Leeds       City Council requires that all doors and windows meet the SBD standard, in       Designing for Community Safety: A Residential Design Guide which       remains their key policy document on planning for crime prevention.
One of       the authors has written to Armitage acknowledging the importance of       Armitage's research in securing this policy requirement for housing in       Leeds.
The West Yorkshire Police's Architectural Liaison Officer for Leeds       has stated that Armitage's research was quoted at "almost every meeting         I attended both locally and nationally".
In addition, West Yorkshire       Police confirmed that ACC's research was instrumental in increasing the       number of Architectural Liaison Officers across the police force.
Armitage       has continued to sustain strong engagement with policy- makers and       practitioners, by disseminating briefing notes commissioned by ACPO, the       Home Office and the Design Council, through media articles, and by means       of the publication of a position paper for the Independent Commission for       the Future of Policing (The Lord Stevens Commission) which has highlighted       the risk to crime prevention of moves towards deregulation within the       planning system.
The ACC continue to contribute to the national debate on       architectural design during a period of austerity and deregulation.
For       example, their work was cited in an article8       in The Guardian newspaper and in the online journal Inside           Housing.
The Guardian article detailed some specific       beneficial impact of the ACC research as follows: "Police and         architects sometimes have different ideas about how to design out         antisocial behaviour.
Cul-de-sac has become a dirty word among         architects, who fear that antisocial behaviour happens where it cannot         be seen, while police insist &#8212; backed up by a 2010 report from the         University of Huddersfield &#8212; that cul-de-sacs are less prone to crime         because they offer fewer escape routes".
The international importance of this research is evidenced by the role of       the ACC in developing Abu Dhabi's planning guidance to ensure that       properties are designed to consider crime prevention.
In 2011, Armitage       was commissioned by the Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council to develop planning         guidance9 specifications for crime prevention.
The       manual, informed by her research, outlines the design principles required       for development within Abu Dhabi.
The ACC received &#163;19,000 to fund this work,       completed in 2011, from Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council.
The       international impact of ACC research into designing out crime is also       highlighted by citation of Armitage's work as evidence in the Parliament       of Victoria Inquiry into locally-based approaches to community safety and       crime prevention.
Armitage and co-workers are cited 43 times in this report10.
The Executive Officer of the Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee of the       Parliament of Victoria11 has testified that: "One area of         academic research that was constantly drawn on in undertaking the         Inquiry and writing the Final Report was that of Dr Rachel Armitage at         the University of Huddersfield".
