     Research at Oxford on papyri has had significant impact in a wide range       of cultural and pedagogical areas.
The significant cultural impact of       increased public understanding of and direct engagement with texts on       papyrus from Oxyrhynchus derives from the Oxyrhynchus Online and       the Ancient Lives websites, which make the complete papyrus       collection visible and all the items of each volume of edited papyri       publicly available.
Together these websites (which are each visited by       about 125,000 users per week) bring the most important repository of Greek       literature and social history face to face with a global audience[i].
Displaying this vast collection of papyrus fragments online has created a       new channel for Classics outreach and education: Obbink's team answers       frequent questions and advises users about learning ancient Greek, the       fundamental principles of studying ancient manuscripts and the Classics in       general.
The Ancient Lives project has also intelligently embraced       social media, such as blogging and Twitter, to communicate with an       entirely new audience and generation[ii].
Owing to       advances in digital technology and the internet, it has succeeded in       facilitating public access to the Oxyrhynchus Papyri collection to an       unprecedented degree.
The Ancient Lives project offers a new platform for       inter-cultural communication that goes beyond academic collaboration and       extends beyond the traditional scholarly community.
Under Obbink's       research leadership, the development of the Ancient Lives website       has enabled a wide non-academic audience to participate in the       transcription of papyri.
Since August 2011, it has recorded well over 1.5       million transcriptions of the Oxyrhynchus papyri, the work of over 250,000       online collaborators.
Within the first months of the launching of the       project, online users helped identify important fragments of authors such       as Simonides, Plutarch, Menander, and Euripides.
Email testimonials       available range from `a paralegal with a love for the written word and a       passion for history' who writes that `I'm excited to know that I can       actually help to further the world's knowledge of our past'[1]       to the mother of an 8-year-old boy in Glasgow seeking advice about the       on-line Greek keyboard.
Comments left on the `Talk' section of the website       include: `I have found that this fragment contains a passage from the       First Book of "The History of the Peloponnesian War".
I can clearly read       lines 4-6' (Anagnostes); `I love working on these fragments, what an       awesome way to involve the "little guy" in such a big undertaking!'
(StephanieS84)[2].
Both research on the Oxyrhynchus papyri and also the Ancient Lives       project in particular have had a significant pedagogical impact.
There is       keen interest in the papyri from continuing education programmes and       secondary schools: project staff respond by giving talks, often       illustrated by original papyri.
Feedback on such talks includes the       comment: `The talk you gave us yesterday was one of the most interesting I       have ever been to, and we were all very excited indeed when you gave us       the papyri to look at.
The girls have been approaching me all day telling       me how informative and fascinating it was (it seems that some of us have       found a new opportunity in the studying of ancient ink!).
...
I will       definitely be volunteering on [Ancient Lives] more in future!
'[3]       The use of the Ancient Lives site in schools has been featured in       a short film on the Guardian's website[iii].
Professional Classics educators in the US, UK and Europe also use the site       in the classroom for teaching purposes.
The project has also published a       number of articles about the latest published texts of particular general       interest in journals and magazines for wider audiences, such as Egyptian         Archaeology[iv].
As a result of this publicity and       the new website, requests to tour the papyrology rooms of the Oxyrhynchus       Papyri Project, housed in the Sackler Library of the Ashmolean Museum,       have increased over the last two years from an average of twenty per year,       not counting visits by representatives from the media, to forty.
For the past four years the Oxyrhynchus project has also hosted and       directed, at the request of their schools, two qualified work-experience       sixth-formers per year.
It thus involves students engaged in learning       Latin and Greek at secondary level in the ongoing hands-on cataloguing and       processing of ancient documents written in those languages from the       Oxyrhynchus collection, and they in turn provide the project with valuable       feedback on user-access to the collection and provision of online and       other resources, and testing of the Ancient Lives interface.
The papyri and their texts enjoy an increasing interest in the news       media, and have been the subject of many newspaper articles and radio and       television documentaries in recent years; nationally, these include BBC       Radio and television documentaries on Oxyrhynchus, and include other       productions in the USA, Australia, and elsewhere[v].
Obbink was interviewed for a television documentary by Michael Wood about       a papyrus identified by the project as offering new evidence on the       location of Alexander the Great's victory at Gaugamela.
Obbink has also       appeared in television interviews with Bettany Hughes on the topics of       women and science in the Oxyrhynchus Papyri and the role played by women       in the early church through the medieval period, and in a radio discussion       with Marina Warner on links between a story found in the Oxyrhynchus       papyri and Grimms' Fairy Tales[vi].
Oxford papyrological researchers have also achieved cultural and       pedagogical impact in other areas:            The Oxyrhynchus Papyri Project has hosted public workshops (each         attended by c. 200 people) at the British Academy and the Egypt         Exploration Society showcasing work in progress and important texts         identified by the project, discussed by invited specialists[vii].
Peter Parsons' research on the cultural life of Oxyrhynchus has         achieved impact through the success of his popular 2007 book, City           of the Sharp-nosed Fish.
This book was awarded two prizes for         popular scholarship in 2008, the John D. Criticos Prize (which         stipulates that winning books `must be accessible to a broad         readership') and the Classical Association prize (which is awarded for         making `a significant contribution to the public understanding of         Classics').
Since 2008, it has been translated into Czech, Greek,         German, French, and Spanish.
The English edition has had hardback sales         of 2568 and paperback sales of 4696.
Another important forum for impact is the Ashmolean Museum, which has         received more than 1 million visitors annually since its reopening in         2009 following a major expansion: the `Reading, Writing, and Counting'         gallery in the new museum includes an installation on the Oxyrhynchus         Papyri.
West's edition and translation of the new Sappho poem has been taken         up in new editions and re-editions of Sappho or Greek lyric.
Translations of the poem appear in W. Barnstone, Ancient Greek           lyrics (Indiana University Press 2010), p. 82, and A. Poochigian,         Sappho: Stung with Love: Poems and Fragments, with introduction         by Carol Ann Duffy (Penguin Classics 2009), while West's own translation         appears in the third edition (2012) of The Norton Anthology of World           Literature, an anthology that is used in courses in English and         Comparative Literature in several hundred higher education institutions         in the United States.
West's Sappho has also entered university Classics         syllabuses in many institutions (e.g.
both poems appear on the graduate         reading syllabus at CUNY)[viii].
