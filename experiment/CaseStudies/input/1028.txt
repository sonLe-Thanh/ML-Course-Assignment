     Impact has been achieved through a series of stages.
First we identified       genuine problems with clinical management and rehabilitation of       post-stroke language impaired patients (limited resources and restricted       access to treatment, a poor evidence base for therapeutic benefits of       standard treatments).
Second, we established that action-embedded training       promotes rapid improvement of language skills, thereby potentially       enhancing patients' quality of life.
In response, we developed an       innovative training programme incorporating action-embedded training to       promote rapid improvement of language skills, with low cost implications       for healthcare providers.
The positive impact of this programme on       communication skills is supported by robust research evidence.
Third, we       developed interest in our therapy through provision of training courses       and dissemination in targeted journals.
Fourth, successful independent       implementation in clinics in Europe and the United States is driving       further interest in the benefits of ILAT for patient and health service       providers.
Intensive language action therapy (ILAT) has been employed by a range of       clinical groups world-wide (see Berthier et al., 2009; Kurland et al.,       2012; doi: 10.1044/1058-0360(2012/11-0113)), thereby rapidly improving       patients' communication and language skills while reducing the strain on       clinical resources (including time and money).
Patients and clinical staff       managing the rehabilitation of those patients are the primary       beneficiaries.
Cost and time savings and more efficient rehabilitation of       language abilities are the primary benefits achieved through adoption of       this therapy.
A specific form of ILAT focusing on training of       "activity/action planning" has led to significant clinical improvements of       language abilities in chronic aphasia patients within two weeks of       intensive intervention (Difrancesco et al., 2012).
Moreover, language       improvements are accompanied by cortical reorganisation measured by fMRI       and MEG indicating long term, stable improvement in language.
Pulverm&#252;ller       and Mohr developed the therapy, and conducted efficacy studies.
They were       the first to design and test the therapy for aphasia patients.
The       theoretical approach was based in part on constraint-induced motor therapy       (CIMT), developed by Taub specifically for rehabilitation of patients with       motor problems/ hemiparesis.
Other clinicians have combined our therapy       with drug interventions to improve neurorehabilitation of language skills       in post-stroke patients (e.g., Berthier, University of Malaga).
ILAT is a short-term and low cost aphasia therapy and has been       implemented in several hospitals and clinics in Europe and the United       States (see sources to corroborate impact).
It provides straightforward       and cost-effective access to language therapy for many patients, helping       to significantly improve the quality of life for stroke sufferers.
Clinical interest in (and uptake of) ILAT has been driven by our academic       publications and aided via the provision of ILAT training courses (by       Pulverm&#252;ller) to speech and language therapists (e.g., Bristol, UK 2010       and Leuwen, Belgium 2011).
In addition to those clinics that have       implemented ILAT in Spain, Germany and the United States, many requests       from speech and language therapists to observe ILAT sessions in the UK       have been received.
