     Publication of what the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education       (NIACE) has described as "the first major piece of research on young         adult carers" (A) has led to a `new' group of carers being         formally recognised.
The work has given policy audiences, service       providers and practitioners a research evidence base and validated       instruments to inform and steer policy, service development and       practice/interventions.
"Until the publication of recent research by       Becker and Becker in 2008, the term `young adult carer' [YAC] had not been       formally used" (B).
Informing Government policy       The UK Government requested and utilised interim findings from the YAC         research to signal in the 2008 National Carers Strategy (England)       its concern for young carers' transitions into adulthood (C).
In 2010, the       new Coalition Government `refreshed' the England National Carers         Strategy.
The new Strategy recognised and differentiated between       young carers and YACs and endorsed cross-departmental Government       commitment to work with others to "provide young adults (including young       carers) with continuity of careers advice" (D).
The Scottish Government also used the research to inform its 2010       Young Carers Strategy and cited the research extensively.
It "concluded         that the findings of a major study undertaken by Saul and Fiona Becker         into the needs of young adult carers were highly relevant to this         [Scottish] Strategy" (E).
The Scottish Strategy's recommendations       (Appendix 5 of (E)) for developing policy and services in Scotland draw       almost verbatim on the recommendations on joined-up working in the       original YAC research report and the specific recommendations therein       about meeting the needs of YACs.
Saul Becker is the sole academic member of the National Policy Forum       established in January 2013 by NIACE to take forward ideas and policy       recommendations.
In May 2013, the Care and Support Bill for England       (Clause 41, 1b) stated that local authorities should consider young         carers' current needs and how these might change post-18, to aid       transition planning &#8212; a key recommendation of the YAC research (F).
The significance of the introduction of new services has been formally       recognised in the House of Lords by Earl Howe, Parliamentary Under       Secretary of State (Quality) Health, who stated "more young carers         services are extending their age group to cover young adult carers       ... the transition between children's services and adult services should       be smoother" (G).
The Chair of the Standing Commission for Carers noted in the       Foreword to the YAC report (1) that the research "provides an evidence       base for the development and delivery of more personalised support and       better outcomes for a vital but often `silent minority' of young people".
Inspiring service development       The original research report has been referred to as the evidence for       developing new services for YACs in many local authorities       (including Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Blackpool, Birmingham, Nottinghamshire       (H)) and by carers organisations in the UK.
Numerous projects       funded by the Government's Innovation Fund and through Comic         Relief Programmes introduced services or expanded the eligible age       range for support from 18 (young carers) to 24 &#8212; to include YACs.
The YAC research provided the evidence base for Carers Trust's successful       bid to become the Co-Operative Society's Charity of the Year,       whose support is worth an estimated &#163;7m over three years (2013-16) to       develop new services specifically for YACs.
Saul Becker has been invited as a steering group member to advise the         National Union of Students in helping to develop national policy       responses and recommendations for YACs attending university, and the NUS       has added information and advice to its website for student carers.
A       number of universities are also engaging for the first time with the         learning needs of YACs and are developing resources and support,       including Essex, Oxford, Winchester and Nottingham.
For example, in June       2013 Nottingham University hosted the first national University open day       specifically for carers under the age of 24.
Providing psychometric tools to inform practice/interventions       The psychometric instruments (MACA and PANOC) developed by Saul Becker         and his team have now been widely adopted.
The instruments are used       across the UK in most young carers projects, by local authorities, other       researchers and professionals, and are increasingly being used       internationally.
For example, the multi-million pound Comic Relief         Young Carers Grants Programmes from 2008 onwards required all funded       projects to use the instruments for self-monitoring and evaluation.
The Government's         &#163;1m Innovation Fund, announced in 2010, also required all projects       to use the MACA and PANOC.
In 2010, the BBC used the MACA with 4000 secondary school pupils         across the UK to screen for `hidden' young carers, advised by Saul       Becker (I).
The findings, reported widely by the BBC and other media,       showed a much higher proportion of young carers than indicated by         Census figures &#8212; 8% of all children &#8212; and received substantial         attention by policy makers (J).
These MACA-derived figures are         now used widely, including by UK Government, as a more reliable       indicator of the extent of caring amongst young people, e.g.
(K).
In 2012, the MACA and PANOC were used by York Consulting and Ecorys       as part of their evaluation of the Government's Innovation Fund and the       Comic Relief Young Carers Grants Programme 2008-11.
The evaluation of the       PRTC's `Improving Health Outcomes Grant programme 2012-13' also requires         evaluators to use MACA and PANOC.
All fifty projects to be funded       under the multi-million pound Co-op/Carers Trust YAC Programme       (2013-16) must use MACA and PANOC (L).
Blackpool and a number of other local authorities used the MACA in         schools to screen for hidden young carers.
Nottinghamshire County       Council uses the instruments to assess young carers as part of a new       multimillion pound recurring programme of support (H).
Young carers'       projects across the UK use the tools for assessment and for determining       levels and types of support (L).
On an international level, requests for translation of the         instruments have been granted to Norway, India, Taiwan, China,       Japan.
The tools are being used by practitioners and researchers in the       USA, Sub-Saharan Africa, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, New Zealand       and Australia (M).
In Norway (N) for example, Saul Becker is         advising government departments that are intending to use the MACA       to screen for hidden young carers, and from this evidence base they intend       to develop policy and services.
Raising awareness       The research also received prominent coverage on national television         and radio.
In October 2012, BBC Radio 1 broadcast the first         radio show specifically on YACs, `Keeping Mum', the commissioning       and content of which was directly informed by the YAC research findings.
Five YACs hosted a two hour show which clearly resonated with other young       people and YACs, as illustrated by many emails and tweets received by the       BBC.
Official BBC figures give combined listenership for the show as         415,000 and related news reports and shorter appearances reached a       further 11 million radio listeners and 3 million TV viewers.
As a       result of the programme, the Care Minister confirmed to the BBC       that schools, colleges and GPs must "up their game" for YACs.
Dissemination to policy and practitioner individuals       Since 2008, Saul Becker has been invited as `expert' keynote speaker       to present research findings to MPs, Lords, Ministers, senior civil       servants, service providers and young adult carers in the Houses of         Parliament and to Government departments in countries which include       Norway, Sweden and Australia.
Saul Becker used 30 keynote invitations         at policy and practitioner conferences across the UK and internationally       to disseminate the Manual and the applicability of the tools,       including providing `master classes' to practitioners in the UK,       Australia, Norway and Sweden on how to score and interpret the findings.
The former Department for Children, Schools and Families made the       research report (1) available as a free PDF download on its website and       the publication of the research report (1) and the user Manual for       MACA and PANOC (2) was also accompanied by a programme of active         dissemination.
This included coordinated press releases from the       University of Nottingham and the PRTC, and emails to over 4000 policy         makers and practitioners across the world, generating international       interest.
The Manual and research report are available free on the       Carers Trust website and on Saul Becker's.
Paper copies of the Manual       were sent to projects involved in the research and to all 350 young         carers' projects in the UK.
