     Mosse's work has been widely read and highly cited by international       development agencies, both official and NGO, and has significantly       contributed to major development programme planning and policy debate       among these and other stakeholders.
Cultivating Development in       particular offers the aid sector something unprecedented: a detailed,       reflective insider analysis of longer-term processes of development       interventions.
The book has provided an analytical approach to policy and       practice across fields ranging from community health to climate change,       forestry reform to microfinance (evidenced in the span of the 765 Google       citations).
(1) The impact is not simply dissemination of anthropological       research on institutional processes, but enabling development       practitioners themselves to reflect in new ways on their own professional       and institutional experiences.
Early impacts of Mosse's work through World Bank and DFID learning       organisation seminars in 2002 and 2003 were extended and deepened in the       post-publication current REF assessment period.
In 2008, on the basis of Cultivating         Development's contributions to better understanding community-driven       approaches to development, Mosse was invited by the World Bank to spend a       full month reviewing the work of its extensive (part DFID sponsored)       Social Development programme in Indonesia, with a view to improving the       new National Programme for Community Empowerment (PNPM), which had become       pivotal to the government's national programme for poverty reduction.
More recently, his critical work on participatory development contributed       significantly to the 2013 World Bank Policy Research Report "Localizing       Development: Does Participation Work?," which cites Mosse and most often       the arguments forwarded in Cultivating Development no less than 29       times.
(2)     Further corroboration of significant impact on the World Bank is provided       in a testimonial from Scott Guggenheim, a senior social policy specialist       at the World Bank before becoming a senior social specialist for the       Australian government, (3) and recently being seconded back to the World       Bank, who has described Cultivating Development as:     "A superb book, one of those rarities that can change entire ways of         thinking.
David Mosse is the first social scientist in a generation who         can successfully take cutting-edge insights from academic anthropology         and use them to explain practical problems in development."
Guggenheim has further encouraged his own staff to read the book and       applied its ideas to do team-based exercises at the organisations he has       worked for:     "We used Dr. Mosse's writings to do a hands-on exercise of trying to         distinguish what we needed to really make programs work from what we         needed so that our head office and the government could approve them.
The results were striking."
Even more significantly, Guggenheim writes:     "Dr. Mosse's work has been fundamental to the analytical framework         that our team has been using to guide these [two] massive programs....
The Afghanistan program &#8212; it's called National Solidarity &#8212; is far and         away the largest development program produced over the course of the         international period there.
It reaches 30,000 communities in every part         of the country, has disbursed over US$1.1 billion, and has been a         foundation program for all of the donors hoping to help Afghanistan         survive its difficult transition, including both the civilian and         diplomatic wings of the British government.
Reaching a total population         of 90 million poor people spread over three time zones, the Indonesian         program is even larger &#8212; it is the president of Indonesia's flagship         poverty program and has been the fulcrum for how the Indonesian         government has responded to both chronic crises such as the 2004 Aceh         tsunami and to the difficult challenges of transition from a military to         a democratic government."
In China (at the Beijing China Agricultural University) applied social       scientists have sought to use Mosse's approach to develop policy-relevant       analysis of development practice within China, and Chinese aid abroad.
In       2008 Mosse was invited to run a development research workshop, to review       programmes in Ningxia, Chengdu and Jiangxi.
In 2013, he was invited to       join the 8-person International Advisory Committee of the DFID-supported       China International Development Research Network promoting knowledge-based       policy development for Chinese development aid.
Membership includes three       of China's most powerful institutions providing policy advice directly to       government: the Department of Development Aid, Chinese Academy of       International Trade and Economic Cooperation, Ministry of Commerce; The       China Center for Contemporary World Studies, International Department of       Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; and the Institute for       International Strategic Studies, Party School of the Central Committee of       the Communist Party of China.
(4)     Mosse's research has generated significant discussion and debate       internationally, in development circles and more broadly.
A particularly       notable recent instance appeared in the publication of conference       proceedings in a double-page spread in a leading national daily newspaper       in Senegal, Wal Fadjri L'Aurore, which has a daily print       circulation of 20,000.
(5) Speaking about the shift in focus of anglophone       anthropological studies of development away from how policy is applied to       how it comes to be formulated in the first instance by international       actors, French anthropologist Jean Copans contends :     "Un chercheur symbolise, selon nous, cette nouvelle perspective, David         Mosse (...) En effet D. Mosse a r&#233;dig&#233; ce qui est probablement l'ouvrage         le plus abouti en la mati&#232;re, dans la mesure o&#249; il couvre l'ensemble du         spectre des &#233;tudes connues en mati&#232;re de d&#233;veloppement (...) Il est         &#233;vident que cette enqu&#234;te globale est tout &#224; fait unique en son genre         mais elle peut et doit servir de mod&#232;le ou d'inspiration pour justement         recadrer et reconfigurer l'&#233;tude du d&#233;veloppement de A &#224; Z".
(`For       us, one researcher symbolises this perspective, David Mosse (...) Indeed,       Mosse has written what is probably the most complete work on the subject (Cultivating         Development), in the sense that it covers the whole spectrum of       well-known studies in the field of development (...) It's clear that this       comprehensive study is entirely unique in the genre but it can and should       serve as a model or an inspiration for suitably redefining and       reconfiguring the study of development from start to finish).
