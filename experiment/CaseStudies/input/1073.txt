     The research led to the development of an evidence-based, commercially       available, cell therapy.
This therapy has delivered major healthcare       impact for patients [S1-S4].
The continued commercial availability attests       to the resilience of the product and the economic model developed for its       sustainability.
Essentially the product is designed for use only with       `difficult to treat' patients.
Fortunately the number of patients with       very severe burns in the UK is low but the impact for these patients is       substantial.
Few tissue-engineering companies achieve the translation of       research into effective products.
This was achieved by the initial spinout       company, called Celltran Ltd, which ran from 2000 to 2008.
Building on the       clinical success of MySkin&#174;, Celltran was acquired by York       Pharma in 2008 and then Ilika in 2009 to further stimulate growth in the       company.
The latter company formed a subsidiary Altrika Ltd to focus on       MySkin&#174; and a related product Cryoskin.
Impacts on patients and practitioners:     The commercial availability of MySkin&#174; from 2004 to the       present time has benefited patients, clinicians (burns surgeons,       diabetologists) and dressing nurses using this product to treat patients.
Thanks to Prof MacNeil's proactive approach to disseminating her results       at meetings of burns and wound healing professionals in the UK from 2004       to the present day, the clinical community has been made aware of the       sound evidence base and the potential benefits of the technology, leading       to the gradual adoption of the therapy by practitioners in these areas and       use of the products on patients (MySkin&#174; has been used to treat       over 300 cases since 2008, with each patient requiring up to 50 treatments       by MySkin&#174;).
The major health impact of this research has been       the improved outcomes of UK patients with extensive burns &#8212; increasing       their chances of survival.
The technology has offered burns surgeons in       the UK the potentially life-saving option of a cell expansion and delivery       service for treating those patients who are in extremis and in       danger of death because of the extent of their burns injuries.
This is the       only commercial service that burns surgeons can access for       treatment of patients if conventional therapies fail, and (as noted by the       head of the Sheffield Burns Unit, below) patients with major burns       represent a real clinical challenge.
For these patients, getting swift       barrier function is essential and difficult.
The use of cultured cell       therapy leads to improved health outcomes through greatly reduced risk of       infection and death and shortened stays in hospital [S2].
The Operations       Director of Altrika Ltd says "Use of the cultured cell technology in         burns units has been increasing since 2008 due to the growing evidence         base that early intervention of these therapeutic approaches can be cost         effective, coupled with efficiencies in cost of manufacture that make         the approach more sustainable for a wider patient cohort.
Altrika         recently added the burns units in Birmingham and Manchester to its list         of customers, bringing the total number of burns centres in England /         the UK who have used this cell therapy to 11 out of 12, with 6 of these         being regular repeat users" [S1].
The Head of the Burns Unit Sheffield Hospitals says in referring to       MySkin&#174; &#8212; "The transition of MySkin&#174; from         research to the clinic, provided through the company CellTran, provided         a commercial service that I or other burns surgeons could access for the         treatment of our patients.
At its establishment, it was the first such         commercially available skin service in the UK and to the best of my         knowledge it's still the only commercially available skin cell service.
Thus the company established a valuable clinical resource, which we use         for those extensively burned patients who can't be easily managed with         conventional skin grafting alone.
It is only appropriate to use cultured         cell therapy for patients with major burns, these patients represent a         real clinical challenge and it is good to know that in the UK there is a         useful resource based on expanding the patient's cells in the laboratory         which clinicians can access" [S2].
The other health impact has been on patients with chronic non-healing       ulcers, which have failed to heal despite best clinical practice.
Patients       with access to cultured cell therapy have benefited from the availability       of the service &#8212; cell therapy can stimulate wounds to heal and restore       quality of life.
For these patients [S4] MySkin&#174; greatly       improves their quality of life and reduces hospital (or home) treatment       costs.
Economic impact:     The cell therapy was developed through a University of Sheffield spin-out       company, Celltran Ltd, which was formed in 2000 for the sole purpose of       developing and commercialising the underpinning research, including       providing a strong clinical evidence base for the culture and delivery of       patients' skin cells for clinical benefit.
The first product was launched       as MySkin&#174; in 2004.
The product is produced in a GMP facility       in Sheffield and has been selling consistently since its launch,       commercialised through a number of different companies:            Celltran was formed in 2000 and commercialised the technology from         launch in 2004 through to late 2008.
The company created 16 jobs and         raised &#163;4 million in investment income from 2004 until 2008.
This         supported a team of 16 surface engineers, cell biologists and clinical         staff (burns surgeons, wound care nurses and staff involved in the study         of diabetic ulcers) and staff who set up and ran clean rooms and engaged         in all aspects of the commercialisation of this technology.
In October 2008 the IP and GMP facility were purchased by York Pharma         for &#163;70k plus royalties for 5 years; the greater of &#163;100k (20k per year)         or 10% of revenues generated.
In September 2009, Ilika bought the GMP facility, setting up a wholly         owned subsidiary Altrika, solely to commercialise this technology (http://www.ilika.com/history.aspx).
In December 2012, Altrika was bought by Adiposet Ltd, a medical logistics       and service company and continues to commercialise both MySkin&#174;       and CryoSkin.
Altrika currently employs 6 people.
