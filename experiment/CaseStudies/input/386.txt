     The Climate Change Act 2008     The UK's Climate Change Act is the primary mechanism by which the UK       government intends to meet its obligations to take action against climate       change.5.1     The ability of the government to pass this legislation and take decisive       action is a direct impact of the recommendations published by Pidgeon and       his co-authors in their analysis and report for the APPCCG inquiry into       cross-party consensus on climate change legislation.
Among several       recommendations, Recommendation 12 called for the creation of a trusted,       independent institutional mechanism through which long-term decisions       about climate change could be addressed and monitored with cross-party       consensus, thereby overcoming the constraint on government action       identified by the Cardiff research group (see Section 2).
Specifically:     "Recommendation 12.
That Government establish an authoritative       independent body, similar to the Bank of England Monetary Policy       Committee, to agree UK climate change targets and measures to meet these,       and to report at least annually on progress towards meeting them, in a       fully transparent manner and in the light of the best available scientific       assessments" (see Section 3, ref 3.1, p.30).
Pathway to Impact     The APPCCG report and recommendations were launched and debated at a       meeting in July 2006 at the Royal Society of Arts.
Over 60 participants       attended this meeting, drawn from the main Westminster political parties,       national policy, NGO and science institutions, with commentary on the       report provided at the launch by senior parliamentarians for Labour,       Conservative and the Liberal Democrats.
The APPCCG chair Mr Colin Challen       MP was shortly afterwards granted a private meeting about the report and       its contents with the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair.5.2     Responding directly to Recommendation 12 of the APPCCG report &#8212; which had       not been previously proposed in the Labour Government's 2005 Manifesto &#8212;       the Government brought forward proposals in the 2006 Queen's Speech for       what became the Climate Change Act, which at its core had the       establishment of the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), an independent       Non-Departmental Public Body of climate scientists and economists mandated       to recommend UK climate targets and monitor progress towards them.5.2,         5.3, 5.4     Establishment of the UK Climate Change Committee     The Climate Change Act was passed into law in November 2008.
The       intellectual debt that the draft Bill owed to the APPCCG report was       recognised by the Royal Society at the time 5.5 and       subsequently by policy commentators.5.6     The work of the Committee now involves advice to HM Government and the       devolved administrations on a range of issues, including the national 2050       carbon reduction target, the setting of (and annual monitoring of progress       towards meeting) interim `carbon budgets', and measures to adapt to       climate change.5.4     The Committee also works to maintain cross-party consensus to prevent       government from falling back into the `governance trap' identified by the       Cardiff research, allowing the Government to establish decisive long-term       policy and legislation with cross-party support.5.4     The Institute for Government has conducted a retrospective evaluation of       the evolution of the 2008 Climate Change Act, and the setting up of the       Climate Change Committee, as an exemplary case study of UK policy success.
The importance of the broad cross-party consensus obtained in formulating       and supporting the Act, and the innovative nature of the Climate Change       Committee as a governance mechanism, is discussed in the evaluation       report.5.7      The Act leads to change     The subsequent work of the UK's Climate Change Committee, and in       particular its initial recommendation that UK carbon emissions needed to       be cut by 80% by the year 2050, has had a series of profound impacts       across all of UK Government and the devolved administrations with regard       to energy policy.5.4 The Government's recent Carbon Plan5.8       describes how in order to meet the 2050 target the UK will have move away       from oil, coal and gas, and invest extensively in new wind energy and       nuclear capacity, electrification of transportation, and foster reduced       energy demand at home, the workplace, and in the energy intensive       industries.
In its 2012 progress report the UKCCC calculates that 0.8% of the fall in       UK greenhouse gas emissions in 2011 can be linked directly to       implementation of proactive carbon lowering measures but that much more       still needs to be done.5.9 In the longer term (circa       2020-2050) the provisions of the Act will drive major technology and       lifestyle changes across all sectors of society.5.4, 5.8     Leading international legislation     The Act also had significant impacts internationally because the UK       demonstrated, through the Act and adoption of subsequent Climate Change       Committee recommendations, the very first legally binding national climate       targets anywhere in the world.
Other countries have followed this lead by       setting up similar institutional mechanisms to ensure cross-party       consensus on climate change,5.4 and paving the way for       effective legislation to drive the necessary `top down' action on climate       change that will change behaviour and the attitude of businesses and       citizens elsewhere in the world.
