     We have brought our work on aesthetics and its modern history to a wider       audience through a       diverse programme of public engagement activities, including gallery       events, `Cultural Days' and       6th form conferences and workshops.
Feedback indicates that       these events have enriched the       cultural and intellectual lives of their participants, and have led some       to reflect in new and       rewarding ways on their own artistic practice.
Podcasts and videos       continue to make much       material available to national and international audiences.
Since 2010, we have held monthly `Philosophy Caf&#233;s' [5.1] at the       University's John Hansard       Gallery.
These popular talk-plus-discussion events are free and open to       all, bringing together a       wide range of people with an interest in philosophy.
Neill led a       discussion at a session on 10/02/11       (outputs 1 and 2), and Ridley did likewise on 01/12/11 (output 6), each       event attracting ~40       participants.
The December session was recorded and made available as a       podcast; it was also       surveyed, with 96% of respondents saying that the event had made them       reflect upon fresh       questions, or upon familiar questions in fresh ways: `Brilliant delivery,       and fascinating question       session'; `Wish I'd had teachers like this when I was at Uni'; `There are       ideas here that I'll take to       my art classes'; `Thank you so much!
Completely brilliant!'
We have also worked with the Southampton City Art Gallery [5.2] to       organise several public       discussion series devoted to themes emerging from our work.
Between       February 2011 and March       2012 Neill and Ridley each led two sessions, each attracting 60+       participants (outputs 1, 2, 3 and       6).
Liza Morgan, the City Council's Lead Learning Projects Officer,       reports that these events `have       been the most consistently well attended ... that we have run at the       gallery in the 9 years' she has       been in post, and, `in addition to the benefit of increased visitor       figures', that `the series has also       led to the development of a sustained relationship between the [Council's]       Art and Heritage       Learning Department and other faculties within the University'.
Participants in the March 2012       session were surveyed: 93% of respondents reported that the event had       prompted them to       consider new issues, or familiar issues from unfamiliar angles.
Comments       included: `I am inspired       by this'; `I shall go back to my studio clearer about my task'; `Great       topic, great talk'; `The most       brilliant instalment of a brilliant series'; `Engaging and fascinating:       better than Melvyn Bragg'.
As a result of the Gallery series, we have been invited to discuss our       work at greater length with       the Romsey U3A (University of the Third Age) Philosophy Group.
Ridley led       a discussion with 15       participants on 29/06/12 (output 4).
The U3A convenor described the event       as `fascinating',       allowing the group `to experience [the] analysis in all its depth and       detail.
An interesting result, too'       [5.5].
Our work has also been brought to a wider public through a `Cultural Day'       organised in partnership       with the Faculty's Lifelong Learning team (27/04/13).
Devoted to `The       Decline of Beauty', it       included contributions from Neill (outputs 1 and 3) and Ridley (output 5),       and attracted 65       participants (at &#163;30 per head).
They rated the day 4.7 out of 5.0, with       92% concluding that they       were `likely to use the ideas that they had heard about in future', in       contexts including `my own       teaching', the development of `an art and design website focusing on       beauty', and `help[ing] me       fend off accusations that my art isn't beautiful enough': `Stimulating,       thoughtful, wonderfully paced       and ever provocative'; `Great &#8212; just more, please!'
On 20/08/08, Neill and Ridley each recorded a `Philosophy Bite' (podcasts       of philosophers       discussing their research for the benefit of a lay audience) (outputs 2       and 5), which, together, have       had 199,834 downloads (as at 17/09/13) [5.3].
A presentation of their       paper `Relational Theories of       Art: the History of an Error' (output 3) was filmed on 29/06/10 by the       British Wittgenstein Society,       and made available on-line; while on 30/11/10, Ridley gave a public       lecture to the Royal Institute of       Philosophy (output 4), which was recorded and made available as a podcast       (download figures       unavailable).
Throughout the period, both Neill and Ridley have given talks on relevant       aspects of their research       to many hundreds of 6th form students and their teachers, from       schools throughout the south of       England.
Participants in 6th form conferences held at       Southampton on 17/12/12 and 22/03/13 were       surveyed: 100% reported that the event had moved them to `think about       unfamiliar topics, or about       familiar topics in new ways'.
Comments included: `extremely informative';       `extremely interesting       and impressive'; `an amazing event'; `I have learned a lot and been       inspired' [5.4].
