     Process from Research to Impact       The underpinning research led to two non-invasive drug delivery methods       with commercial       potential.
The development of an effective oral delivery system for       vaccines, Bilosomes, and the       development of an inhalation formulation technology for delivery of drug,       Inhalosomes.
The       inhalosome technology initially encapsulated Cisplatin for the treatment       of non-small cell lung       cancer, but has potential for application to all lung cancers and other       respiratory diseases.
Several       commercial collaborations then developed involving the Research and       Knowledge Exchange       Service at the University of Strathclyde, leading to the following types       of impact.
Commercial adoption of new technology: VBI Vaccines is a company       dedicated to the       innovative formulation, development and delivery of safe and effective       vaccines.
Their approach to       vaccine development addresses significant market opportunities, and aims       to fulfil critical unmet       medical needs.
Through a recent strategic acquisition, VBI has expanded       its pipeline of       thermostable vaccine programs and is also developing its own Lipid       Particle based vaccines       (Source A).
VBI licensed the patented Bilosome technology from Strathclyde       University in July       2008, and benefitted from access to the Bilosome patent.
Technology       transfer assistance from the       Strathclyde research team has allowed VBI to further develop the Bilosome       technology and they       have filed further patents in related areas between 2008 and 2013.
The       Vice President Operations       of VBI has confirmed that "After acquiring the Bilosome technology from         the University of         Strathclyde in 2007 VBI has made great efforts in attempting to         formulate and manufacture various         antigens into effective vaccine candidates.
Three of the key antigens         focused on within VBI's         bilosome projects were Hepatitis A, shigella and Influenza.
The         experiments conducted between         2008 and 2012 helped to build a knowledge base on the technology's         advantages and         disadvantages as an effective drug delivery platform.
The existing         bilosome technology was         effective in its ability to induce an immunogenic response with the         appropriate antigen however its         manufacturing method in Chloroform was viewed as not viable for         manufacturing at a commercial         scale.
As a consequence and based on feedback from Strathclyde         scientists, VBI began evaluation         of alternate manufacturing processes."

Following the signing of the licence agreement in 2008 VBI Vaccines       achieved a Series A funding       of $36M and accredit 50% of that to access to the NIV technology.
This       funding allowed them to       employ between 35 and 40 skilled scientists in two locations in North       America, working on NIV       related activities (Source A).
Morvus Technology Limited is a pharmaceutical company specialising in the       discovery and       commercialisation of novel drugs for the oncology market (Source C).
The       company has the       capability to generate revenue by out-licensing a number of early-stage       products whilst       simultaneously progressing selected candidates through clinical       development and into patient       trials.
Morvus collaborated with the researchers at Strathclyde to       understand how NIV technology       could improve the solubility of certain small molecule compounds and       therefore make them viable       drug candidates.
Success has meant that they are now looking to partner       and license their IP for       further development.
The Chief Executive Officer of Morvus has confirmed that "In 2010-2012         Morvus Technology Ltd         used the research findings of Dr K. C. Carter, Dr V. Ferro and Professor         A. Mullen to help develop         a formulation of their in-house drug for delivery using Inhalosomes as a         treatment for lung cancer.
This has involved knowledge transfer from the University to establish         processes and protocols.
The         Strathclyde 'inhalosome' method offers significant advantages over other         available delivery         systems as it permits us to target (Cisplatin or drug) directly to the         lung &#8212; reducing the need for         intravenous delivery with associated disadvantages (discomfort to         patient/side effects).
The         application of this technology is affecting our business plans as we         anticipate it will give us         competitive advantage over other pharmaceutical companies in this area."
(Source D)     Investment in research and development: The University of       Strathclyde has collaborated with       Biovaxpahrma Ltd to create a new biotechnology spin out Inhalosome-C,       which was awarded a       &#163;196k TSB grant in December 2012 to develop the NIV/cisplatin combination       for inhalation delivery       in lung cancer.
In collaboration with Respironics Respiratory Drug       Delivery Inc. a subsidiary of       Philips Healthcare, the researchers are also investigating how nebulisers       can be used to improve       pulmonary delivery.
This project is in the early stages and the Business       Development Manager of       Philips Respironics Drug Delivery confirms that "Since this project         commenced in July 2013 there         has been a useful exchange of information.
In particular, Philips         Respiratory Drug Delivery (RDD)         has used your research findings...to assess the Inhalosome technology in         drug delivery.
This has         helped RDD develop processes and protocols for the in-vivo and in-vitro         delivery of the NIV         platform with our I-neb aerosol drug delivery device."
(Source E)     Inhalosome technology has been the subject of a technology transfer       project with Aptuit Ltd, a       pharmaceutical services company that delivers early to mid-phase drug       development solutions.
This has enabled the technology to move to proof of manufacture through       the creation of suitable       processes and protocols related to the manufacture of Inhalosomes       encapsulating the       chemotherapy drug Cisplatin.
They have a successful division working on       Inhaled Dosage form       and formulation (Source F) and this experience of working with the       University of Strathclyde       Inhalosome project fits well within their expertise and areas of       scientific interest.
The Director of       Development at Aptuit confirms that "From February 2013 Aptuit has used         the research findings of         Dr K. C. Carter, Dr V .Ferro and Professor A. Mullen to successfully         establish a manufacturing         process for lnhalosomes as a step towards scale-up for commercial         production" (Source G).
Improved drug manufacture and delivery: The new inhalation       formulation technology       (inhalosomes) permits delivery of small molecule therapeutics, initially       encapsulating Cisplatin for       the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, but with potential for other       therapeutics for lung       cancers and other respiratory diseases.
The development of an oral vaccine       allows for absorption       of the pharmaceutically active ingredients into the blood stream from       contact with the mucous       membranes of the gastrointestinal tract, providing greater effectiveness       of the vaccine.
A further       beneficial impact is the "green synthesis" of the vaccine removing the       need for the use of       chloroform in its preparation.
The new manufacturing process with       inclusion of novel lipids has       been tested with Encap Drug Delivery Ltd, Livingstone and has reduced the       time of manufacture.
In addition both delivery systems allow the therapeutic to be given by a       non-invasive method,       reducing the need for trained staff (which is a requirement for       intravenous delivery).
This will       reduce healthcare costs and increase patient compliance, particularly with       those who are reluctant       to take injectable medication.
