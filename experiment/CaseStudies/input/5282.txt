     Direct Economic     Corrosion costs the petrochemical industry about $12 bn pa at 1999 prices       [7] and it is essential to detect and manage it for the safe operation of       plant and to avoid environmental disasters such as leaking pipelines in       Alaska or subsea.
Corrosion in pipe systems often happens at unpredictable       locations and conventional inspection techniques require scanning over the       whole surface to be inspected.
Given the volume of pipes in service this       is impractical.
The guided wave inspection system described above solves       this problem and makes it possible to do 100% screening of pipes that are       otherwise prohibitively expensive to inspect.
In 1999 a spin-out company Guided Ultrasonics Ltd was formed to       commercialise the technology under licence from Imperial Innovations, the       College technology transfer company.
It now employs 7 PhD graduates in NDE       topics from Imperial with a total staff of 15 in UK.
It sells equipment to       service inspection companies who do the inspection for the oil companies;       the equipment and examples of applications are given in [8, 9].
The       company has turned over &#163;32M in the REF period 2008-2013 as confirmed by       Operations Director, Guided Ultrasonics Ltd [B].
Imperial Innovations also       licenses the technology to a Welding Institute subsidiary company, Plant       Integrity Ltd, whose system is described in [10, 11].
This company has a       similar turnover so during the REF period the turnover from the technology       directly has been &gt;&#163;50M, over 80% of which is export [A].
The test systems last for 5-10 years and there are over 300 systems in       service worldwide; they are typically charged at &#163;2500/day [B].
Assuming       50% utilisation, revenue to service inspection companies is ~&#163;75M pa and       over 300 FTE inspectors are employed (crew of 2 per inspection).
The       income generated for the service inspection companies is therefore around       &#163;450M over the REF period.
End User - Economic and Safety     The benefit to the end user companies is reduced cost of inspection e.g.
pipes buried under roads - excavation for conventional inspection costs       upwards of &#163;80k [C]; insulated pipes - stripping and re-instating       insulation typically costs $100-2000/m depending on whether scaffolding       etc.
is required [B].
There are also significant safety benefits e.g.
:            Offshore risers - corrosion is most likely in the splash zone where         safe access for conventional inspection is expensive to ensure; in         contrast a guided wave test can be conducted from deck level where safe         access is easy to provide [C].
100% volume inspection coverage gives much better probability of         detecting severe, isolated defects than local inspection on a sampling         basis.
The technology also enables the end user companies to carry out more         inspection of critical, inaccessible lines and so improve safety and         environmental performance.
An example of the use of the technology to         inspect an oil transmission pipeline crossing a swamp in Mexico is given         in [12].
The enhanced safety benefit is much more difficult to quantify         but is clearly substantial.
The technique is mainly used in the         petrochemical industry but is also used in the power generation         (especially nuclear) and gas transmission sectors.
Standards     Guided wave inspection has been recognised as a Method of NDE in its own       right, and its worldwide use has grown steadily to the point at which it       is appropriate to establish standards.
This is important to ensure that       the method is used correctly, and also that its capabilities are not       over-sold, both vital ingredients to its long-term success.
Professor Lowe       is leading the development of standards, working with standards bodies, in       close collaboration with Guided Ultrasonics Ltd and Plant Integrity Ltd.
The British Standard [13] explicitly cites [4] above and there are also       Italian [14], Japanese [15] and US [16] standards.
Training of inspectors       is also crucial to the successful application of the technology and       certified training schemes are now in place e.g.
PCN (UK), ASNT (USA),       RINA (Italy).
