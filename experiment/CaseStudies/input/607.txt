     The body of research has challenged the way NHS resources are allocated       on philosophical,       technical and empirical grounds.
The research concerns the redistribution       of very significant       amounts of public money, the end result of which are huge variations in       per capita funding and       expenditure.
Although the research is challenging and politically       difficult, the research team built a       successful case for a new model to be used to the extent that the NHS       commissioned the team to       develop mental health estimates.
This informed the setting of       practice-level budgets from 2009-11       and accounted for approximately &#163;8 billion of NHS funding.
This is the       first time that such a       methodology has been used to distribute NHS resources in England.
The Department of Health guidance to PCTs (2009/10) states that the       mental health component is       based on a new methodology developed by Plymouth University that models       types of individual       patients.
It continues with `the new methodology has undergone         extensive testing by the         researchers and DH and we believe it provides a step-change improvement         in the way we model         mental health need.'
The guidance for 2010/11 includes an enhanced       version of the same       methodology and again credits it to Plymouth university.
Due to the       restructuring of PCTs and       changes in the system of funding, the methodology has not been continued       for 2011/12 although       the research team continue to advise the Government via meetings on how       the methodology       should be used to ensure a fairer redistribution of NHS funding.
The research continues to build and influence Government thinking around       the redistribution of       NHS funding.
The work is cited in Research Paper 11/16, The Local       Government Finance       Settlement, 2011-13 as part of a series designed to brief Members of       Parliament in support of their       parliamentary duties.
The briefing states `There are concerns that the         methodology used to         allocate funds are flawed, particularly the concepts of distributing on         the basis of additional (above         threshold), not actual, need and resource.
This technical issue will not         be discussed any further         here, but those who wish to look into this in more detail are directed         to the reports (Gibson and       Asthana 2011) sourced in the footnote.'
The research has been quoted in Parliamentary and Lords Debates and in       news/opinion pieces in       the British Medical and Health Services Journals.
The researchers were       also asked to write a       briefing paper for the Right Honourable Jeremy Hunt, Secretary of State       for Health.
Graham Stuart       MP, Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Rural Services and the       Rural Fair Share campaign       has stated that `Professor Asthana's work has been crucial to informing       Parliamentary debate       about the allocations of health and local government funding from central       government.
It has been       all the more commendable for challenging the prevailing orthodoxies in       both fields.
In a time of       austerity the equity with which limited resources are distributed takes on       a greater importance than       when overall budgets are increasing year by year.
That's why the forensic,       needs based       understanding promoted by Professor Asthana has had such influence and       significance.
I have       discussed Professor Asthana's work with both the previous and current       Secretary of State for       Health, and the latter has read and commented positively on her research.'
Their research highlighted the technical shortcomings of the Four Block       Model and seriously       damaged its credibility as a method of allocating revenue support to local       authorities.
The Local       Government Baseline Sub Group considered that it contributed to the       understanding that the       model was no longer tenable.
David Illingworth, part of the Local       Government Baseline Sub Group       drew upon Asthana's research as part of the review.
He states:     `the work that they did contributed to the decision to end the four         block model' and continues `Their         work on threshold authorities did lead to what became widely understood         as the "Wokingham         effect".
This simple example about threshold levels illustrated the         excessive, complicated and         unexpected consequences of a very small change in the figures for a         small and otherwise         unremarkable authority in the Thames Valley.
These effects were clearly         indefensible and this was         one factor that led to the end of the four block model.'
The research on rural areas and the potential mismatches between need and       resource allocation       has impacted on a range of rural organisations which have either       commissioned Plymouth       University to look at their particular issues or drawn upon the research.
As the Acting Director of       Public Health Dorset &amp; Somerset Strategic Health Authority stated on       the work commissioned by       the Rural Health Allocations Forum :     `This report has had a real impact on the thinking within the NHS, has         been extensively used by         rural health authorities and I believe contributed to the requirement of         `rural-proofing' the         introduction of new services in the NHS including resource         consequences.'
The body of work carried out has impacted widely and has raised difficult       questions about NHS       resource allocation.
It remains an active area of work at Plymouth and the       team will continue to       ensure its reach and significance impacts at all levels.
