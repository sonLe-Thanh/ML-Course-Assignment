     Assessment.
A challenge for pain clinicians is to determine the       aspect of a complex clinical presentation for treatment targeting.
The       BAPQ, BAPQ-P (parent-completed version for non-communicating adolescents)       and BAPQ-PIQ (parent impact version) provided the first tools designed and       validated with the patients (and families) to enable that targeting.
They       have been translated into French, Spanish, Dutch and Thai, and have been,       and continue to be, used in the USA, Canada, Europe and Australia [1].
Affirmation of the value of these tools may be illustrated by comments       from the Director of Psychology Services in Pain Medicine at Boston's       Children Hospital (Harvard Medical School) [2]: "... the Bath Centre         for Pain Research has also been the leading center in the development         and dissemination of focused outcome assessment tools to inform our         understanding of the impact of pediatric pain on the child and family.
The Bath Adolescent Pain Questionnaire (BAPQ) and its companion BAPQ         Parental Impact Questionnaire (PIQ) are the first well validated tools         specifically focused on providing a broad based assessment of the         functional impact of pediatric pain, encompassing physical, emotional         and social domains in both children with pain and their parents."
Similarly, a Professor of Pediatrics at the Connecticut Children's       Medical Center (CCMC) attests [3], "... we are expanding our program         and resources for treating chronic pediatric pain and currently utilize         a multidisciplinary assessment process that includes standardized         questionnaires.
As we continue to refine our assessment process and         services at CCMC, I take comfort in knowing that we can rely on [the         BCPR's] validated assessment tools and treatment program as a model."
Further examples of the reach and significance of the assessment tools       come from (a) the Director of the German Paediatric Pain Centre, who said       [1], "The BCPR measures are carefully developed, scientifically sound         and essential for good clinical practice.
In addition they deliver         important data for the understanding and treatment of paediatric chronic         pain... We constantly follow the output of the Bath research group,         given the high scientific standard and the clinical importance of their         research", and (b) from the Seattle Children's Hospital (with which       Bath is collaborating on a U.S. NIH funded grant to evaluate the       feasibility and acceptability of problem-solving skills training as an       intervention in parent caregivers of youth with chronic pain, and to       conduct a preliminary efficacy trial in parents of youth with chronic       pain) [1]: "The BCPR tools provide unique information regarding the         impact of pain on child and parent emotional and physical functioning."
Treatment.
The treatment developed in Bath has proven highly       effective in spreading best practice, and has led to foundational research       on the patterns and predictors of disability in adolescents, and to new       service provision in chronic pain for adolescents, all over the world.
It       continues to attract a great deal of attention &#8212; for example,       approximately five international visitors a year observe at least a week       of the treatment programme.
Professor Eccleston has lectured internationally on treatment content,       development and effectiveness, and his award of the Pfizer Visiting       Fellowship in Paediatric Pain in 2007 to visit New England and Connecticut       as the guest of the CMCC [4] led to their implementation of the BCPR       assessment tools and treatment developments during the REF period.
Significantly, the programme has been replicated, inter alia, at       the Institute for Rehabilitation in Chicago [1], in the Pediatric Complex       Pain Service of Dalhousie University (Canada) [1], at the CCMC [3], and at       Harvard Medical School [2], where the Director of Psychology Services in       Pain Medicine at Boston's Children Hospital states, "Unequivocally,         the Bath Centre for Pain Research and its clinical partners set and         continue to represent the gold standard for intensive inter-disciplinary         treatment programs in the field of pediatric pain management.
The [BCPR]         was the first successful program developed for children and adolescents         with complex, intractable chronic pain conditions.
In the past decade,         numerous top academic medical institutions in both Europe and North         America have sought to create programs following the model of care         established at the [BCPR].
As a co-creator of our own such program here         at Boston Children's Hospital, the Mayo Family Pediatric Pain         Rehabilitation Center (opened in 2008), I can attest that our program is         closely based upon this model.
The [BCPR's] clinical program has become         the model to emulate in the field due to their highly successful         outcomes and international reputation for providing excellent clinical         care."
The Professor of Pediatrics at the Connecticut Children's Medical Center       (CCMC) is equally enthusiastic [3]: "[The BCPR's] ground-breaking work         to assess, understand and effectively treat these most complex pediatric         patients with chronic pain has been a steadfast beacon of light in the         often murky trenches that make up the day to day work of intensive         rehabilitation treatment programs for pediatric pain...
I have found         your program's emphasis on addressing psychological wellbeing, in         balance with goals for improved physical functioning, to resonate widely         across treatment settings specializing in pediatric chronic pain."
Policy and advocacy.
The BCPR authored and maintain the two key       Cochrane Library Systematic Reviews (see Section 2 and references in       Section 3), one on parent treatments, the other on those for adolescents.
Both are updated biannually and provide the evidence for policy and       clinical development.
Although the international workforce in paediatric       pain is small, it has been able to significantly increase its impact and       scope through a special interest group of the International Association       for the Study of Pain.
In 2010, Professor Eccleston was chair of the       scientific programme committee for the International Symposium on       Paediatric Pain, which attracted 550 of the world's top scientists and       lead clinicians in the field [5].
In addition, Bath supported a grant to develop Pain in Child Health       (PICH) [6], an international programme, which has to-date produced a       community of more than 40 postgraduates with formal and informal training       in the assessment and treatment of paediatric pain.
PICH operates on a       policy level to influence paediatric pain practice worldwide, and the Bath       group are the only behavioural science group in the UK to be involved in,       and have impact on, the training of new paediatric pain researchers.
The BCPR has contributed to a number of policy initiatives, including (a)       supporting the UK Chronic Pain Policy Coalition, (b) co-chairing the       expert group writing the American Pain Society Guidelines on the treatment       and assessment of chronic pain [7], and (c) agreeing the consensus       statement on core outcome domains and measures for all new randomized       controlled trials in pain [8] (which include the Bath instruments).
In the last two years, the UK has moved to specialized national       commissioning of services for patients with severe and disabling       conditions like chronic pain, and the Bath Service is included, as are the       use of specific measures (BAPQ and BAPQ-PIQ) [9].
The move to specialized       services is a major advance and is the culmination of much work to promote       the needs of young people.
The BCPR is now in discussion with NICE on       planned guidance in pain related topics, specifically in how to inform new       guidance, including that planned on children and young people in pain       [10].
