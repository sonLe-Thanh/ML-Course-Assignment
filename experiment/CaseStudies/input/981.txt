     Launching and developing The Reader Organisation 	The Reader Organisation       grew from the successful launch of The Reader magazine, edited       initially by J Davis, The Reader Organisation's current director       (1997-2008) and P Davis, (editor 2008-present), which currently has c.600       subscriptions.
Since 2001 The Reader Organisation has delivered       `Get into Reading', a community outreach programme running reading groups       in diverse settings: homeless hostels, secure units, GP surgeries,       neurological centres, libraries.
`Get into Reading' is a distinctive model       of shared reading of serious literature where participants read aloud       together, with regular pauses for discussion.
In 2008 The Reader         Organisation delivered, in collaboration with the Department of       English, The Shipping Lines Festival (core funding from the       University of Liverpool of &#163;52k) which reached over 1,000 attendees       through 60 events.
From its base and research underpinnings in the Department of English         The Reader Organisation was spun out of the University in 2008.
The         Reader Organisation currently runs over 360 `Get into Reading'       groups nationally, with 6,000 beneficiaries per annum and now employs 78       people and 125 volunteers, with an annual budget of &#163;2m and staff located       in hubs in Merseyside, London, South West England, Glasgow and Belfast.
`Get into Reading' is also developing in Denmark, Belgium and Australia.
The Reader Organisation was awarded       the Morgan Foundation Best Charity in 2010, secured the social enterprise       mark in 2011, and in 2012 was one of 50 Nesta/Observer New Radicals,       organisations actively changing communities for the good.
Social and Health Impacts     Our own         research in 2010 consistently demonstrated increased wellbeing       following from participation in `Get into Reading'.
The reading and       depression study, by demonstrating the benefits to mental health of `Get       into Reading', has been a critical factor enabling The Reader         Organisation to extend its activities by accessing organisational       and funding support.
Through the dissemination described in section 2       above (to over 700 delegates, from health, government, public services,       charity/volunteer organisations) and via The Reader Organisation's       connections with strategic commissioning and policy-making bodies       nationally, the reading and depression study has contributed to securing       two-year commissions for The Reader Organisation to implement `Get       into Reading' as a health intervention from: 5 Boroughs Partnership Trust       (2012, &#163;90k); West London Mental Health Trust (2011, &#163;80k); Liverpool PCT       (2011, &#163;60k); Southwark Borough Council (2012, &#163;48k); Cheshire and Wirral       Partnership Trust (2012, &#163;30k).
This research also helped to secure a       one-year commission for The Reader Organisation from the North       West Strategic Health Authority (2012, &#163;150k).
1500 beneficiaries of these       commissions have reported improvements in mental health/well-being.
One       evaluation of the economic benefits of `Get into Reading', conducted on       the Wirral by the Centre for Public Health at Liverpool John Moores       University (May 2013), calculated       that every &#163;1 of investment into `Get into Reading' generated a social         return average of &#163;6.47.
The Centre for Research into Reading       (CRILS) at the University of Liverpool recognises the significance and       potential impact of cross disciplinary enquiry and is continuing The         Reader Organisation's tradition of public service and engagement.
A       research networking event, `Reading with Children and Families' (April,       2012), invited 12 looked after children and their carers to receive awards       for their reading achievement.
At The Reader Organisation's       most recent international conferences (British Library, May, 2012; May,       2013), CRILS' research findings were translated into training material for       future `Get into Reading' project workers.
The research has also       contributed to the training and continuing professional development of the       78 project workers internal to The Reader Organisation and to the       training of 900 external health and social care staff.
