     The incidence of domestic abuse in Scotland has risen steadily since the       recording of data began in 1999-2000.
In that year the eight police forces       in Scotland recorded a total of 33,197 incidents of domestic abuse.
By       2005-06 this had increased to 45,796 incidents, of which 23,983 were       recorded as a crime or offence.
These resulted in 15,134 reports to the       Procurator Fiscal, an increase of 67% since 1999-2000.
The vast majority       of incidents of domestic abuse (88%) are perpetrated against female       victims and likewise, the vast majority of perpetrators (87%) are male.
Repeat victimisation is common among victims of domestic abuse.
In 2005-06       just over half (51%) of reported incidents involved known repeat victims.
The research by Connelly at the University of Glasgow was instrumental in       shaping legislative change and improving access to justice for victims of       domestic abuse, and providing the resources required for practitioners in       this field to identify and engage in best practice across Scotland.
Shaping legislative change: Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2011       Connelly's study identified the institutional barriers to assistance faced       by (primarily) women experiencing domestic abuse.
On the strength of her       research, Connelly was asked to advise Rhoda Grant, Member of the Scottish       Parliament (Labour, Highlands &amp; Islands) on the drafting of a Private       Member's Bill (the Civil Protection Orders and Access to Justice Bill)       originally intended to address the issue of access to Legal Aid by       domestic abuse victims.
Grant's Bill, which became law in March 2011, was       amended to include two main barriers identified in Connelly's research       which had not been addressed by the proposed legislation.
This Bill now       provides important protection for victims of domestic abuse that had not       existed before, specifically:            Scotland now has named domestic abuse interdicts;       Breaching protection orders is now a criminal offence; and       Victims can now obtain a protective order on the basis of one incident         where previously they had to experience repeated incidents before a         crime was seen to be committed.
During a speech in the Scottish Parliament, Holyrood (16 March 2011),       Rhona Grant MSP directly thanked Connelly for developing the `solution         for how the bill could be shaped to tackle the issues.'
And praised       her 2003 study as research `which gave her a clear understanding of         what needed to be done'.
Enhancing practitioner guidelines and delivery of services: Handling           Domestic Abuse Cases &#8212; A Toolkit       Connelly was a member of the Legislative Subgroup of the Scottish       Parliament convened to examine the issue of domestic abuse in Scotland       which recommended the establishment of specialist courts in Scotland in       2006-08.
Based on her research findings and expertise in this area,       Connelly was also commissioned by the Scottish Government to produce an       evidence-based toolkit to guide Sheriffs Principal in rolling out the       specialist response to domestic abuse across Scotland.
She authored       `Handling Domestic Abuse: A Toolkit to Aid the Development of Specialist       Approaches to Cases of Domestic Abuse' in May 2008.
The Toolkit evaluated       the specialist court set up and piloted since 2006 and is aimed at       practitioners in this field of the criminal justice system to help them       develop an informed, specialised approach to dealing with cases of       domestic abuse; it is now used throughout Scotland.
The Toolkit has       enabled the Scottish Government to develop a successful Domestic Abuse       Court model by providing expert guidance to sheriffs and other court       personnel making policy decisions within their courts on key issues such       as the safety of complainers, independent advocacy, victim clustering and       fast-tracking of cases.
Influencing the work of NGOs       Both impacts outlined above have influenced the work of NGOs that work       with those subjected to domestic abuse, including Scottish Women's Aid,       the Women's Support Project and ASSIST, the specialist domestic abuse       advocacy service that provides advocacy and support to victims of domestic       abuse.
Reflecting on improvements brought about under the Specialist       Domestic Abuse Court, recommended by the Legislative Sub-Group of the       Scottish Parliament, of which Connelly was a member, and for which she       then evaluated and prepared the practitioner Toolkit to ensure the       effective delivery of, the Senior Development worker at The Women's       Support Project states:     We rely a great deal on Scottish research to provide evidence for         different approaches, and to support our training and awareness         work...whilst there will undoubtedly still be a few abusive individuals         who will continue to abuse regardless of the consequences, our view is         that the Domestic Abuse Act has strengthened protection for victims of         domestic abuse, stalking and harassment...
The introduction of the         Domestic Abuse court and training / awareness raising activity around         the court opening brought a marked improvement in the process for         victims of abuse.
The shorter wait for cases to go to trial was         generally welcomed, and encouraged women to contact the police and to         make complaints.
Prior to the new court we had sometimes had comments         from women along the lines of "the police were great but the court let         him off".
It is our impression that the dedicated court and Sheriffs has         brought a greater understanding of the process of domestic abuse, ie of         'coercive control' into the prosecution of domestic abuse.
