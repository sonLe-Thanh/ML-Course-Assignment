     This research has been applied to over 20 infrastructure projects.
Examples of impact on these projects are presented below.
Skanska Bevis Marks foundation pile reuse monitoring (2011, Soga and         Elshafie)       When a structure is demolished and another built on the same site, it is       normally impossible to reuse the existing foundation piles, because their       condition is unknown.
Skanska sought to reuse foundations on Bevis Marks       building and asked the DoEng if its research could be applied to determine       the condition of the old piles.
Soga and Elshafie used underpinning       research finding (a) to instrument the piles by coring into them from top       to bottom to insert DFOS cables.
This enabled the DoEng team to measure       the evolution of strain during demolition of the existing structure and       throughout construction of the new building.
This monitoring produced key       evidence proving that the existing piles were able to take the loads.
The       total cost saving on the project was GBP6M, because it would have cost       GBP5M to remove the 67 old piles and associated walls/slabs plus GBP1M to       install replacement piles.
Less material was used in construction, which       equates to a saving of 1000 tonnes of CO2, which would otherwise have been       released during the course of construction.
In addition, 3-6 months of       construction programme time were saved on the project.
The project won the       Ground Engineering Sustainability Award 2013 for Skanska [7].
The EPSRC       website, Growth Stories, states: "In the future, Skanska plan to use         the same approach.
By reusing foundations the construction programme can         be shortened, typically saving GBP2-3M per project plus associated CO2         and time savings."
Thermal energy piles &#8212; developing an industry standard (2012, Soga)       Underpinning research finding (a) was fundamental to the creation of the       Ground Source Heat Pump Association (GSHPA) "Thermal Pile Design,       Installation &amp; Materials Standards", Issue 1.0, published by the GSHPA       on 1 October 2012.
Soga was the co-author of these standards.
Chair of the       GSHPA and Geotechnics Director at Arup [9], states: "This work has         generated a completely new industry sector for Geothermal Pile         specialists".
Thames Water &#8212; Thames Tideway project (2011 &#8212; present, Elshafie, Mair         and Soga) When constructing a shaft next to a building, owners of       the building need assurance that damage will not result from ground       movements.
Often, the only way to provide assurance is to employ excessive       protective measures, which increase project costs and introduce delays.
Thames Water asked Elshafie, Mair and Soga to use underpinning research       finding (b) to apply a performance- based design approach to justify a       reduced level of protection on their next major Thames Tideway tunnel and       shaft excavation project, comprising 25km of 7m diameter tunnel and 20       major shafts (total cost GBP4B).
Thames Water has estimated that this will       save at least GBP10M on the cost of construction and has enabled       innovation in design through improved understanding of the structural       behaviour and improved understanding and confidence in the fundamental       behaviour of the shafts and the associated ground movements.
Senior       Technical Consultant on the Thames Tideway project from Thames Water [10],       said in 2013: "Perhaps, more importantly, the confirmation of the         design models that will be realised by this work will give greater         confidence and less objection by third party structure owners and         operators thus reducing level of institutional objection during Planning         process."
Thames Water's approach has been changed by this       successful result; it will apply the method to all future major shaft       excavations.
Tubelines/London Underground (2010, Soga)       Based on research finding (c) Soga was invited to install DFOS in a       concrete segmental lining section of the Jubilee Line tunnel between Bond       Street and Baker Street station with the aim of using the information on       the observed movements of segmental joints to determine the mechanisms of       deformation and whether the whole lining section needed to be replaced or       whether it would be sufficient to reinforce the lining with steel straps       at much lower cost.
The measurements and subsequent analysis showed that       it was appropriate to continue with reinforcement with steel straps as a       safe temporary option, rather than having to immediately replace the       tunnel lining.
This example shows the value of DFOS in guiding       infrastructure owners on the right course of action both in terms of       safety and long-term maintenance.
It is difficult to put monetary value on       this but making safety-critical maintenance decisions to avoid expensive       disasters has considerable value.
Profession Head, Deep Tube Tunnels,       London Underground [11] said in 2013: "The data gained from this and         other monitoring systems was invaluable in proving that the tunnel would         continue to distort and deteriorate if untreated.
This led to the         important decision to temporarily reinforce and subsequently completely         rebuild the affected section of tunnel".
Overall Impact:       Associate Director and Lead Geotechnical Engineer, Arup [12], stated in       2013: "The Fibre Optics work at Cambridge has set a new agenda for         monitoring strains and temperature in a number of civil engineering         structures", "Companies across the world are using the outcomes of the         research" and "The research has been instrumental in developing new         standards for understanding diaphragm wall shaft deformation behaviour         and response of piles to thermal loading".
CEO of Crossrail [13], stated in 2013, "[Robert Mair's] team's work         on Crossrail and other related projects is cutting edge.
Optic fibre         strain gauges to measure the performance of our tunnel sections and         shafts &#8212; something that is a first anywhere in the world.
Developing         asset management systems that detect changes in the condition of the         asset over its life cycle.
Both these projects are being developed for         us to understand better how our structures and assets behave and how         long term, we can save money through more economic design and reduced         life cycle costs."
Consultancy income for DoEng (Soga, Mair and Elshafie)       The research has led to the DoEng team being commissioned as consultants       on a number of construction projects, using the underpinning research       findings to determine the most cost effective solutions during       construction projects.
The DoEng has earned GBP391K across 21 projects       since May 2008.
Industry engagement in the Centre for Smart Infrastructure and         Construction (2011 &#8212; present, Mair, Soga and Elshafie)       In 2011, the DoEng team was awarded a GBP9.5M grant from EPSRC and       Technology Strategy Board to develop the Centre for Smart Infrastructure       and Construction (CSIC).
CSIC has attracted an additional GBP7M from       industry (both cash and in kind) to continue to develop and demonstrate       smart infrastructure solutions including DFOS.
One of the major activities       of CSIC is to develop robust methods and equipment for DFOS deployment so       that industry can lead in the deployment of DFOS monitoring systems.
Industry partners are strongly supporting this activity by continuing to       invite the DoEng to deploy DFOS to inform their construction projects, and       companies such as Costain, Skanska and Laing O'Rourke are actively       discussing how they can develop their own capabilities.
Based on this,       CSIC is developing training for construction operatives and engineers in       deployment of DFOS.
CSIC has 40 industry partners including Costain, Laing       O'Rourke, Skanska, Arup, Atkins, Halcrow, Mott MacDonald, WSP, Parsons       Brinkerhoff, Crossrail, Network Rail, London Underground, Thames Water and       Transport for London [14].
