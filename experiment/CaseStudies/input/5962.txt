     The most important impact has been the protection and preservation of one       of the largest and most significant works of medieval art in Britain, for       York Minster, the City of York and the broad public that is concerned with       Britain's heritage.
By enhancing the tourist experience at York Minster,       York's principal tourist attraction, the conservation project has made a       major contribution to the economy of an important English city.
The       success of this project is also now transforming conservation practice       nationally and beyond the UK.
Conservation and Interpretation     The East Window Advisory Group (EWAG), set up in 2005, has been the       central mechanism for facilitating the impact of the Department's research       on the conservation project, which has been ongoing throughout the       assessment period (#5.1-3).
EWAG's membership includes Marks,       Norton, Ayers and Brown; the Minster architect and other representatives       of the Minster; and conservators at York Glaziers Trust, which Brown also       directs.
Without the EWAG's earlier academic research, rigorously tested       findings and collectively drafted method statement (2009, #5.2),       which has guided the conservation of the window throughout, the Minster       would not have secured the necessary approval of the Cathedrals Fabric       Commission for England, required by the Care of Cathedrals Measure (the       ecclesiastical equivalent of Listed Building Consent) before conservation       projects of this kind can proceed (#5.4-5).
The EWAG's contribution       was also central to the construction of the Minster's case for the &#163;10.5       million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund (2011) for York Minster         Revealed, which has financed the window's conservation (#5.6, 5.8).
In the application of the EWAG method statement, and thus in meetings       discussing each panel individually, the underpinning research has informed       understanding of the glaziers' working practices and design processes, and       issues of both restoration and meaning.
For example, questions of       narrative structure, and word and image, of the kind explored in the       research of Ayers, Brown, Norton and Marks, have been crucial to the       restoration of a window that represents the first and last books of the       Bible: in the re-ordering of the panels, as well as in the conservation of       their individual contents.
The results of the conservation and restoration of the East Window are       demonstrated by the illustrations below, which show the transformation in       the appearance of just one panel, out of 144 main-light panels and 144       tracery panels.
In this, as in each case, the Department's art-historical       research has underpinned the interpretation of meaning and change over       time, informing the restoration of clarity to the design and improved       legibility for visitors.

Within the Minster, a &#163;750,000 display (opened in October       2012) has, as its dramatic centrepiece, the `orb': a custom-designed       structure for the changing display of conserved panels from the East       Window, alongside photographs taken before conservation, accompanied by       interpretation based on EWAG research (#5.9).
Accompanying interactive displays have been similarly informed by       departmental research.
For example, the cutting-edge 3D digital model of       the Minster's development c.1100-1500 has been constructed with       reference to Norton's unpublished research on the Minster's eastern arm.
As a result of these new attractions, between October and December 2012       visitor figures to the Minster rose by 21%.
A team of 15 volunteer stained       glass guides has also been trained in association with the opening of the       `Bedern Glaziers Studio' in a formerly disused medieval building, and       managed by the Glaziers Trust, directed by Brown (#5.10).
Since its       opening in January 2009, over 6,000 people have witnessed the conservation       in progress for themselves, with a sharp increase since the launch of the       orb (1212 visits between October 2012 and May 2013).
Web access: Since October 2011, a `Panel of the Month' feature on       the York Glaziers Trust website has enabled the public to follow the       project's progress, attracting nearly 12,000 virtual visits (# 5.11).
Media: The window was also the subject of a BBC4 Documentary, Britain's         Most Fragile Treasure, part of the BBC/V&amp;A series Handmade         in Britain to which Ayers, Brown and Marks all contributed (#5.12).
On 22 October 2012, the unveiling of the orb was featured on BBC         Breakfast, the BBC One O'Clock News and ITV Calendar         News.
On 29 October 2012, the orb was also featured on the BBC Inside         Out programme for Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.
In addition, in April       2013, conservation work on the East Window featured on BBC Two's Escape         to the Country.
Press Coverage: The project has been featured in the local and       national press, including the Dalesman, Daily Telegraph, Independent,       and Daily Mail.
This hitherto unprecedented application of       art-historical research within a sustained partnership between academics,       conservators and the patronal institution is now regarded as best practice       for medieval stained glass conservation: it `has clearly set new standards       for major conservation projects of this kind' (Peter Draper, Commissioner       (2001-11), Stained Glass Sub-Group, Cathedrals Fabric Commission, #5.5),       and `will undoubtedly serve as a model for future restoration not only in       York but in the rest of the UK and Europe' (Richard Shephard, Chamberlain       of York Minster and Director of Development, # 5.7).
It has been       followed by the Jesse Tree Window Advisory Group at Salisbury Cathedral       (involving Brown), and the conservation of the Great East Window at Wells       Cathedral (involving Ayers and Marks).
Endorsed by the Cathedrals Fabric       Commission for England, such partnerships are also being explored across       Europe.
Brown spoke on this topic in the conference series `Cattedrali       Europee, Conservazione Programmata', in Pisa in May 2013.
