     Numerous impacts resulted from the research including: impact on US       humanitarian policy in relation to gender; impact on development of law       and on US Supreme Court decisions; and impact on UK immigration policy.
Impact may be identified in the development of official policy; case law;       and the creation of rules and regulations; impact on UNHCR, public policy       and public debate.
Impact on humanitarian policy and gender: The findings were cited       by the US Assistant Secretary of State for Global Affairs and the       recommendations regarding gender and nationality discrimination informed       US government pledges to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees       (UNHCR).
The report was presented to staff in the US Department of State,       Bureau for Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) in September 2011.
On       25 October 2011, the Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, Maria       Otero quoted from the report at length, during a talk to the US Institute       of Peace in Washington, D.C. Otero identifies Kingston University and by       extension Blitz and the IOS team.
There is little research on the issue of statelessness, and even less         on gender discrimination in nationality laws.
To try to understand the         impact of statelessness better, the State Department's Bureau of         Population, Refugees, and Migration recently funded a study by Kingston         University to examine the costs of statelessness.
Among its most         striking findings, the study proved that statelessness reduces household         income by a third, and reduces the odds of owning one's home by nearly         60 percent.
The average education of stateless households is lower than         that of citizens by at least one year and in some cases as many as six         years.
The study also demonstrated disadvantages for stateless persons         in terms of health status, and access to justice and law enforcement.
Otero then records that Secretary Clinton has identified women's       nationality rights as an important area of work for the State Department       and sets out two objectives including `the strength of our public         diplomacy to increase global awareness of women's nationality rights',       as recommended in the above report.
[See: (1) http://www.state.gov/j/176132.htm]     On 7 December, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton then declares: `The         United States has launched an initiative to build global awareness about         these issues and support efforts to end or amend such discriminatory         laws.
We want to work to persuade governments &#8212; not only officials but         members of parliament &#8212; to change nationality laws that carry this         discrimination to ensure universal birth registration and establish         procedures and systems to facilitate the acquisition of citizenship for         stateless people.'
[See (2): http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2011/12/178406.htm]     Clinton says the US government pledges to: `Focus U.S. diplomacy on         preventing and resolving statelessness among women and children,         including efforts to raise global awareness about discrimination against         women in nationality laws and to mobilize governments to repeal         nationality laws that discriminate against women.'
[See (3): Pledges         2011 - Ministerial Intergovernmental Event on Refugees and Stateless         Persons http://www.unhcr.org/4ff55a319.html]     On 8 March 2012, Clinton launches the Women's Nationality Initiative,       a diplomatic measure to increase awareness of discrimination against women       in nationality laws and to work with foreign governments to repeal or       amend their discriminatory nationality legislation [See (4): Women's         Nationality Initiative http://www.state.gov/j/prm/releases/releases/2012/185416.htm]     On 5 July 2012, the US government authors a UN resolution on stateless       women and children which is presented before the UN Human Rights Council       and successfully passed with support from 48 other countries.

(http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/newsarticles/2013/april/10-rules-april)     Impact on Supreme Court decisions: Blitz's 2009 study,       `Statelessness, Protection and Equality', is cited in the US Supreme Court       case of Ruben Flores-Villar vs United States of America (0905801),       an important case regarding the rights for children born out of wedlock to       acquire US nationality.
The defendant's legal team relied on Blitz's       research to clarify nationality rights under US federal law, arguing that       the state's authority to determine rights to nationality must be       reconciled with principles of equality between the sexes.
Blitz's work is       recognised in the final ruling where the Supreme Court rejects by 4-4,       (Justice Kagan recused) the argument that a federal law which establishes       different standards for children born out of wedlock outside of the United       States to obtain U.S. citizenship, depending on whether the child's mother       or father was a U.S. citizen, is unconstitutional (5.8): http://tinyurl.com/o3ce66n].
Impact on immigration policy: In spite of the negative outcome of       Ruben Flores-Villar, the decision is included in guidance published by the       Immigrant Legal Resource Center to advise applications for immigration &#8212;       thus impacting on hundreds of thousands of immigrants, community       organizations, and experts working in the legal sector.
(See (5.9): http://www.ilrc.org/files/documents/ilrc-natz_cit_chart_b_0.pdf)     Impact on UNHCR, public policy and public debate: Constantine's Nowhere         People project was supported by UNHCR and exhibited in Geneva, Hong       Kong, London, Nairobi, New York, Washington, DC.
The resulting       publications received multiple awards including: National Press       Photographer's Association Best Photojournalism Award 2013; Pulitzer       Center for Crisis Reporting, 2012 (5.10); Human Rights Press Award Hong       Kong, 2011 (Merit); Amnesty International Media Awards (finalist) (2010) (http://pulitzercenter.org/blog/ebooks-stateless-refugees-ibook-author-apple-award-burma).
Constantine's       Exiled to Nowhere: Burma's Rohingya won the Days Japan       International Photojournalism Special Jury Prize (http://www.daysjapan.net/e/award2011/index.html)       and was voted Independent on Sunday Book of the Year 2012 (photography) (http://tinyurl.com/aouav8c).
These       award winning outputs led to extensive coverage and policy and public       debate on statelessness.
