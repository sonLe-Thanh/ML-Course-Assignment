     An undesirable consequence of rail reform and privatisation in Britain       has been sharp increases in both rail infrastructure costs (from roughly       &#163;15bn during the first five years after privatisation to &#163;30bn during the       second five year period) and train operating company unit costs (up by       around 15% since privatisation).
The ITS Leeds research commissioned by       ORR has enabled the regulator to benchmark the efficiency of Network Rail,       by providing the key evidence for the regulator to set efficiency targets.
The efficiency improvements delivered by Network Rail have directly       benefited taxpayers via lower subsidies (although these benefits could       instead be directed to passengers through lower fares).
Economic impacts &#8212; improving the efficiency of rail infrastructure         provision     The first of these studies [1] was used by ORR as the central piece of       evidence on Network Rail's efficiency performance in the 2008 Periodic       Review [A].
The efficiency gap, estimated at 37% by the ITS Leeds       modelling, was used directly to derive a funding settlement for Network       Rail covering the fourth `control period' (CP4; 2009/10 to 2013/14).
A       quote from the ORR's final conclusions document emphasises how the model       was used: "...we [ORR] consider that it is reasonable,         transparent and prudent to adopt the 37% value from the preferred model         as our estimate for the efficiency gap for each of maintenance and         renewals in 2006-07."
[A, p157].
Corroborating the role       played by ITS Leeds, ORR [A, p126] noted: "...the econometric analysis         work was undertaken by ITS working closely with both Network Rail and         ourselves".
The value of the efficiency targets set by ORR, based on the ITS Leeds       evidence, was to reduce the cost of maintaining and renewing Network       Rail's infrastructure from around &#163;18.2bn to &#163;15.8bn over the five year       regulatory control period (2009/10 to 2013/14).
Note that this reduction       is smaller than 37% because ORR phased the target gradually over a ten       year period.
A letter of corroboration from ORR [B] notes: "Following         the PR08 process, assisted by the ITS econometric efficiency model, ORR         deemed that the efficient cost should be only &#163;15.8bn (in 2006-7         prices).
This work thus directly influenced the determination by the ORR         of Network Rail's funding for CP4, much of which is provided by         taxpayers".
The second study commissioned by ORR [2] was also an international       econometric modelling exercise, but this time expanding the sample size by       utilising sub-company (regional) data within individual railways (drawn       from a sample of participating European and North American railways).
The       model from this second exercise was quoted in ORR's 2008 determination as       a supporting, corroborating study to the first study outlined above [A,       p125].
Setting standards for rail regulatory reviews     In its review of ORR's regulatory efficiency analysis, the National Audit       Office in 2011 noted that: "...the Regulator initiated an innovative         international benchmarking exercise with the Institute of Transport         Studies (University of Leeds) during its 2008 Periodic Review" [C,       p31].
Since the 2008 Periodic Review, the approach was further developed and       used in subsequent assessments; ITS Leeds modelling supported the ORR's       Annual Efficiency Update process in 2010 [D].
Furthermore, Smith and Wheat       were seconded part-time to ORR during 2012 and 2013 to advise the       regulator on its benchmarking methods for the 2013 Periodic Review; their       contribution is acknowledged in the 2013 Draft Determination [E].
Informing policy &#8212; the long-term future of Britain's rail system     The modelling work [1, 2] also formed the basis of future efficiency       targets for Network Rail (CP5; 2014/15 onwards) documented in the Sir Roy       McNulty Rail Value for Money study (which commenced in 2010 and was       published in 2011) [F].
This is arguably the most significant report on       rail costs in Britain, which has assessed efficiency and value for money       since privatisation and takes a long-term perspective on its future.
A letter of corroboration from DfT [G] notes: "The [McNulty] study         represented a major review of rail costs, efficiency and value for         money, and set out a new policy direction based on its analysis and         findings.
The study identified savings for the whole industry of between         &#163;2.5bn and &#163;3.5bn per year (or 20-30% of total system costs), of which         the savings identified for Network Rail from the work conducted by ITS         accounted for &#163;1.8bn per year (&#163;1.2bn per year earmarked to be achieved         by the end of CP4 and a further &#163;0.6bn per year by the end of CP5)".
Through implementing the recommendations of this study (and because of       growing passenger revenues), the level of subsidy paid to the railway is       forecast to fall from &#163;4bn in 2010-11 to around &#163;1bn by 2019.
In addition, ITS Leeds research (a project report for ORR based on [4]       and an earlier conference paper version of [5]) is also quoted by McNulty       [F] as a key piece of evidence, amongst others, in determining future       targets for train operating costs.
Changing practice in other regulated sectors     Extending the reach of the research impacts to other sectors, ITS Leeds       was commissioned (with consultants CEPA) by the water regulator OFWAT in       summer 2012, to develop new econometric models and advise on how they       could be used to set a `corridor' for allowed cost levels, whilst       complying with the OFWAT's aim to achieve a "light touch" approach to       regulation.
The preliminary report [H] released in 2013 sets out the       approach developed by ITS Leeds (with CEPA).
This work has fed directly       into OFWAT's 2014 regulatory review (PR14), as OFWAT has now decided to       adopt the ITS Leeds approach to econometric modelling for PR14.
Furthermore, Smith has been appointed (from August 2013) as the       regulator's academic adviser on cost assessment.
