     1) Open access publication       As stated in REF3a, open-access publication is integral to our research,       and the environments it       offers have provided our recovery research projects with new pathways to       impact, especially the       major open-access resource Labouring-Class         Poets Online.
Prior to 2008, this resource consisted       of material relating to six hundred poets; since July 2008, 1,060 poets       have been added.
A       revitalised version of the resource was launched collaboratively in April       2013 by a team led by       Goodridge, with co-investigators from two US universities (Creighton,       Omaha, and Notre Dame),       and involving NTU PGR Whatman.
Its Advisory Board brings together scholars       from the US, UK       and Germany, including John Barrell, Florence Boos and Gustav Klaus.
The       database includes,       among occupational groupings, 230 weavers, 130 shoemakers, 40 miners, 18       postmen, 17       policemen and 7 hairdressers as well as 30 shepherds and 25 herders.
Of       these, 12% are       women; 55% Scottish; 5% Irish; 1% Welsh.
Entries include biographical and       bibliographical       information .The content richness and availability of these online         materials open this         resource to readers worldwide and outside of HEI contexts.
Evidence       of the reach and       significance of this resource is provided in the testimonies       gathered together in Ergo's report       (source 6) on this project's impact.
One respondent's comment is       representative: `If there is a       "centre" for work on labouring-class British writers, it is at Nottingham       Trent, where over the years       John Goodridge, Timothy Burke, Tim Fulford, and David Worrall have       contributed so       indispensably to this field'.
Alongside the `Labouring-Class Poets Online' resource, the Unit       co-ordinates the John         Clare Resources website (ed.
Goodridge, from 2013; this includes       Goodridge's electronic edition of       Clare's The Village Minstrel).
Post-2008, the public understanding       of Romantic writing has also       been influenced by our support for the Romantic Circles editions       of The           Letters of Robert Bloomfield and his Circle (ed.
Fulford&#8212;left       2012&#8212;and Pratt; assoc.
ed.
Goodridge, 2012), The           Collected Letters of Robert Southey (ed.
Fulford, Pratt &amp;       Packer, 2009), and Bloomfield's The           Banks of Wye (ed.
Fulford &amp; Pratt, 2009).
These resources       enhance cultural life by preserving,         and enabling the public interpretation of, cultural capital; their       impact is to be located       primarily in their conservation of overlooked literary artefacts and a         neglected cultural         heritage.
2) Trent Editions       The ethic underpinning Trent Editions is also one of preservation and         conservation, combined         with an emphasis on public accessibility and broad dissemination,       operating with print runs       of between 500 and 1000 copies for each volume.
They are well-designed,       inexpensive softback       books designed to appeal to students, sixth formers and general readers       whilst reshaping the       canon through the scholarly presentation of neglected figures.
Books are       sold to the public       through both the NTU online store and major book retailers, including       Abebooks, Allibris, Amazon,       Blackwell's, The Book Depository, and Waterstones.
Trent Editions'       involvement with public       debates about copyright and accessibility is exemplified by Editorial       Director Goodridge's       Guardian       article of 2000 and which become the subject of a 2010 House of Commons       Early Day       Motion on `The Publication of John Clare's Poetry' (EDM:         1191; 25.3/2010).
Its impact has also         in part been economic, since print-based publishing contributes to       prosperity via production and       distribution organizations.
Trent Editions occupies a distinctive niche       amongst UK small presses       and its publication strategy has influenced other small presses,       including Cheltenham's Cyder       Press and the Library of Wales series, both of which now include titles       featuring labouring-class       poets.
3) Literary Societies, Festivals, and Outreach Activities       A third distinctive quality of work associated with this case study, further         linking scholarship         with the wider public, has been its close involvement with literary       societies, especially the 500-strong       John Clare Society but also the two societies founded or co-founded by NTU       scholars, the       Robert Bloomfield Society (Lucas, Goodridge) and the Thomas Chatterton       Society (Goodridge,       Nick Groom (Exeter U)).
These are constituted bodies and members of the       Alliance of Literary       Societies, and the John Clare Society is affiliated to the John Clare       Society of North America.
These entities have strong local, educational and community links,       as well as a substantial       online (open) presence.
Throughout the impact period staff in this Unit       have contributed to the       annual John Clare Festival in Clare's village of Helpston with 150-200 in       attendance and involving       regional and local schools and voluntary organisations.
Goodridge is Vice-President of the John Clare Society and a senior       advisor to the Chatterton and       Bloomfield Societies.
He has engaged in talks with Bristol City Council       over the future of       Chatterton's house (2011), and was consulted by the John Clare Trust over       their development of       Clare's Cottage (2006).
NTU hosted with the Bloomfield Society an annual       `Bloomfield Day'       throughout the impact period, and has regularly offered speakers for talks       on labouring-class       poetry and on Clare for academic events, literary festivals and similar       events.
Across these       various external activities, NTU research on labouring-class and radical       writing has connected         with local communities, forged links with public organizations, and made         a distinct and         material contribution to knowledge beyond HEI contexts.
