     The accessibility of the two corpora resources maximised the impact of       the Glasgow team's research beyond academia.
SCOTS engaged public         interest from the outset, introducing linguistics to a wide audience       through its web portal and articles in mainstream media.
Other key impacts       of the corpora have principally been in the fields of technology,         commercial lexicography and education.
Public engagement     At the time of launch the SCOTS website averaged 165,000 page views per       month, and it has achieved an average 36,000 page views per month as at       July 2013.
The resource itself drew heavily on material supplied by the       public to build up its stock of linguistic resources, and so found       innovative ways to appeal for non-specialist assistance, including radio       and press pieces.
The team also published longer pieces in two Scottish       interest magazines, ScotLit and Leopard, and an article       about the project appeared in The Big Issue in March 2009.
A large       proportion (c.40%) of the corpus material was obtained in response to       these activities, with the longer articles being cited with particular       frequency as the reason for engaging with the project.
The applications of SCOTS have been appreciated particularly in the field       of English Language Teaching outside academia: between 2005 and 2012       Corbett gave a series of presentations on topics such as the use of the       corpus in ESOL (English for speakers of other languages) in North and       South America (Pittsburgh, Brasilia, Rio, Santiago), the UK (Glasgow,       London, Swansea) and Middle East (Istanbul), to combined audiences of over       500 specialists.
In a less specialised context, in June 2010 and 2011 Bann       gave public presentations at Glasgow's West End Festival to audiences of       c. 90 people.
Technological development     The Corpora projects have led to technological developments in and beyond       the field of corpus and computational linguistics.
Beavan developed       synchronised audio transcription resources which draw on corpus data to       produce data visualisations, providing accessible and concise overviews of       language not readily apparent through close reading and ideal for       encouraging non-specialists to explore linguistic data.
These tools were       adopted for use with other corpora &#8212; such as the British National Corpus &#8212;       and informed the development of other text analysis tools, such as Voyant       Tools.
Beavan's `Collocate         Cloud' tool won the international award for the `Best New Idea for       Improving a Current Web-Based Tool' at the 2008 TADA Research Evaluation       eXchange.
Commercial lexicography     SCOTS is heavily used in lexicography, forming a major data source for       Scottish Language Dictionaries and for the revisions of the Oxford         English Dictionary.
The Director of Scottish Language Dictionaries       writes:     The SCOTS Corpus has       become an essential data source for Scottish Language Dictionaries'       editors [...] The content and presentation of this Corpus have       unparalleled advantages which render it indispensible for certain focused       kinds of search.
An Etymologist at the OED confirms:     Both corpora (SCOTS and CMSW) are in day-to-day use by us in our revision       of OED [...] [T]hey are invaluable sources of quotation and form evidence       which goes straight into our revised OED3 entries, allowing us to deepen       and extend our coverage of Scots.
[...] Without recourse to these corpora       OED3 would certainly be the poorer.
Education     The SCOTS resource has influenced educational content.
Between 2006 and       2013 selected texts drawn from the corpus have been used by examination       boards for Higher and A-Level exams.
These are the Scottish Qualification       Authority (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009); University of Cambridge International       Examinations (2012); and Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations (2011,       2012, 2013), who commented:     OCR would like to thank the SCOTS Project for allowing us to make use of       its material in our examination and support materials.
The resource is of       value to us both in terms of its range and ease of access but, most       importantly, its accuracy and attention to detail.
Given its free accessibility, the SCOTS corpus has considerable value for       use in schools, promoting knowledge about how language works, reasons for       the co-existence of different kinds of language at one time, and how       language changes over years, decades and centuries.
Anderson, Corbett and       Kay have demonstrated the uses of the corpus at Continuing Professional       Development events for teachers, including sessions on `The Scots       Language', `Computing in English Studies' and `Grammar for Teachers',       attended by 172 teachers.
They also led a monthly Scottish Literature       Reading Group based on the corpus (2009-10), attended by 35 teachers.
In       2010, Corbett delivered a lecture to 100 teachers at the ASLS Schools         Conference, and distributed copies of Corbett and Kay's Understanding         Grammar in Scotland Today, which draws its data from the SCOTS       corpus.
Understanding Grammar was described in the English Excellence       Group Report as `A very important resource with excellent exemplification       for this area', and the book was used as the basis for Christine       Robinson's Modern Scots Grammar (Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2012), a       grammar book for younger students.
Anderson and Corbett also published Exploring         English with Online Corpora (Palgrave, 2009), which is widely used       in University and ELT teaching, and was described in Literary and         Linguistic Computing as `an excellent introduction to corpus       research for readers without prior knowledge of linguistics' which       `successfully put the [SCOTS] corpus in the spotlight'.
The book has sold       c.400 copies in Europe and over 700 copies overseas, and a second edition       is currently under consideration.
