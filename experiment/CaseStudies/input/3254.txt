     The ABB electrostatic system based upon Teesside's research is currently       the most widely adopted commercial technology whereby PF flow can be       measured and PF flow distribution can be actively controlled.
Since       demonstration of the technology and its commercialisation by ABB the       PfMaster flow measurement systems have been installed in many power       stations worldwide.
The development of this measurement technology at Teesside, in       conjunction with colleagues at ABB, has led to 5 UK, 3 USA and 1         European patents since 1993 [1].
Although the benefits of PF distribution control are highly site       specific, the techno-economic analyses undertaken in ECSC project 7220       PR050 [2] determine             NOx reduction of between 7.5% and 20%, depending on         the firing configuration of the plant.
Boiler efficiency gains of between 0.22% and 0.37%.
Payback periods between 3.5 and 7 years.
Assuming the boiler efficiency improvements to result in equivalent       reductions in carbon intensity of combustion, these estimates lead to:             Carbon emission reductions of between 5 and 8 kg CO2           per tonne of coal.
For illustration, Methil power station was a 60 MW facility.
Assuming a       capacity factor of 75 % this equates to a constant output of 45 MW,       generating approximately 1 GWh each day.
With a net calorific value for       coal of approximately 26 GJ/tonne, this equates to between 700 and 1,100       kg CO2 of emissions reduction per day.
ABB Ltd have, between January 2008 and July 2013, sold in excess of 148         units for installation in international markets including USA,       Europe and China [1], and have sold 510 in total since 2000.
The Greenbank Group UK are installers of the PfMaster technology and have       provided Teesside University with a report estimating the impact of       PfMaster installation [3].
During the period 2008 to 2013 their revenue       from PfMaster sales totalled &#163;272,878.
Greenbank state that       installation leads to improvements in coal distribution and particle       fineness consistency, leading to lower carbon-in- ash and improved power       station efficiency of 0.85% per fully installed unit.
Greenbank estimate       that this has had an economic benefit on their customer stations of         &#163;2.4m during 2009-2013, based on a typical &#163;500,000 saving for a       typical 500 MW boiler and typical fuel process for the period.
Greenbank further estimate that, based upon increased unit output       achieved through lower dust emissions, the installed units will have       generated a saving of &#163;160,000 per year over the period 2009 -       2013.
Environmental benefits have been estimated by Greenbank to be valued       at &#163;240,000 over the period due to reduced ash disposal and a         NOx reduction of ~ 100 mg m -3.
The development of the rope-breaker technology, underpinned by Teesside       research, contributed to Greenbank's receipt in 2007 of two Rushlight       Awards which support and promote clean technologies.
Research in this area and the collaboration with both ABB and Greenbank       is on-going and led by Dr Zhang as part of the Analytical Instrumentation,       Measurement and Control Engineering theme of Teesside University's       Technology Futures Institute.
