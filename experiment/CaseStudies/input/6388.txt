     The impact consists of two strands:            Impact on the understanding and intentions of a range of education and         care professions;       Informing public debate and understanding about colour, drawings and         behaviour and development.
Informing public debate and understanding     Public understanding and debate about colour and drawings have been       influenced and informed by the research work of Burkitt and Greenlees.
Burkitt's and Greenlees' has been debated across a range of media       platforms across the world as is evidenced below (and supported in the       corroborating evidence).
Dr Greenlees work on colour as a cue in football was picked up in 2008       and more widely in April 2010.
The latter study also led to the BBC       Horizon programme inviting Greenlees (and Russell Hill an anthropologist       at Durham University) to extend the research as part of the programme       aired August 2011 (viewed by 1.49M viewers; BARB viewing figures.)
The       Director of this programme describes the impact it had on her and her team       in her blog "The whole thing was a technicolour experience that made us         see the world through different eyes".
The programme was reviewed       and discussed widely, themes addressed in the programme (including       Greenlees work) were picked up and explored or challenged (e.g.
Guardian,       theartsdesk.com, http://www.althinking.com,       http://petapixel.com/, http://www.mirror.co.uk       , Radio Times).
Furthermore, specific evidence of debate is available as a download from       national radio broadcasters outside the UK, for example NPR (National         Public Radio; June 05, 2010; US; 26M listeners per week;       website ranked 672 of all websites globally based on alexa.com figures)       and Radio New Zealand (1 May 2010; reaches 14% of national population of       NZ, 491,000 listeners).
In the first example Greenlees research is       discussed by an esteemed guest mathematician (Prof Devlin, Stanford       University) and in the latter Greenlees was invited to describe his       research and then entered into a debate with the presenter around       questions such as whether the effect related to the penalty taker or       goalkeeper.
Greenlees was then invited to give advice to all listening       goalkeepers.
Furthermore, the backdrop of the England World Cup campaign       (South Africa 2010) meant that Greenlees work was also discussed at that       time by those with an interest in England's chances of success; it was       discussed by Chris Evans and Moira Stuart on Evans Radio 2 show (Audience       reach 13-14M), on Talksport (Audience reach of 2.5M listeners).
The public debate informed and influenced by Greenlees' work is evident       in many online forums.
As indicated above, themes and implications of       Greenlees' work are picked up and commented up by bloggers, commentators,       football fans and other members of the public.
Sites, some of them hugely       popular in global terms, range from http://www.scienceofsocceronline.com,       http://www.goalkeepersaredifferent.com,       http://www.sbs.com.au/, http://bleacherreport.com/,       http://www.fifetoday.co.uk/.
Example debates which demonstrate that individuals have engaged with       research and their thinking has been stimulated: Bleacher report (ranked       275 of all sites globally based on web traffic, alexa.com): "..Two,         while we may be culturally conditioned to see red as a danger signal,         there's actually no evidence that wearing red has a negative effect on         the penalty taker's performance during actual football matches".
New       Scientist's Daniel Elkan draws from Greenlees work in his discussion piece       on how certain colours have an impact on the way people think and behave,       "Clearly the effect of wearing red is strong enough to tip the balance         of fights and soccer matches, but where did it originate?

Dr Burkitt's work has been picked up and discussed by a range of media       platforms across the world although not to such a wide extent as       Greenlees' work.
For example, Dr Burkitt was asked by Lloyds Pharmacy       (November 2011) to analyse adults drawings of the experiences physical       pain and produced an analysis of 500 adults' drawings as part of this       consultancy work.
The Lloyds press release was picked up by others e.g.
Fibromyalgia Association UK.
Her research has also attracted media       attention with an interview with The Guardian published online commenting       on the childhood drawing of a Felix Baumgartner (when kids' drawings       reveal their ambitions 16/10/13).
Burkitt was quoted throughout the       article which prompted a number of online comments; the article was       commented on in other blogs e.g.
http://02mysoup-aa.soup.io/tag/Children.
Burkitt's work has been picked up and discussed in the context of literacy       http://mradamhigherenglish.wordpress.com/2012/08/17/reading-and-summarising/.
Impact on the understanding and intentions of a range of education and         care professions     Dr Esther Burkitt designed and ran a programme of knowledge exchange       workshops in Spring 2013.
These workshops were designed to raise awareness       of two key issues identified through Dr Burkitt's research, namely that:       different perspectives on interpretation can be taken by different       stakeholders in understanding children's communication via drawing; and       that cues in the drawing situation influence the emotional basis of what       and how children draw.
The criteria for the workshops were professions       with involvement with child development and drawing, educational and early       years and parent groups.
Workshops and attendees are as follows:            Parental group (attendees = 6) (April 2013);       Preparatory school teachers (June 2013) (attendees = 10) &amp; July         2013 (attendees = 8);       Primary and secondary school teachers who became teacher trainers (May         2013) (attendees = 8);       Early Years trainees with placement roles participated in two         workshops (April 2013) (attendees = 20 );       SENCO practitioners engaged in two workshops in June 2013 (attendees =         25 ) (total of 77 participants, 51 of whom were professionals, 20         trainees and 6 parents).
The groups reported during and after the workshops that insights about       colour use and audience types would inform their comments to children,       would assist in framing feedback about drawing and would give them food       for thought for integration into future lessons.
Post-workshop feedback       from educational and early years professionals yielded a range of comments       demonstrating changes in perspective and actual and planned behaviour.
For       example, the knowledge that children will draw important figures       differently depending on who they are drawing for yielded such quotes as "We         will be observing the pictures children create for others and those         which they do for themselves to see if there are differences" and "If         I want children to do their best work I tell them that someone important         to them would like to see it!
They take more care and attention and I         ask them to show their pictures to another adult who gives them praise",       and "we will be observing the pictures children create for others and         those which they do for themselves to see if there are differences".
The follow up included asking about any changes that have arisen on the       basis of findings about colour use, wellbeing and emotion and such       responses included "I have definitively changed the easel and         resources: added more colours and made the area more private" and "I         think in the future I will be more aware of children's use of colour and         I would be interested in finding out more about possible links between         colour and emotion".
The parent group participants also reported,       through post-workshop feedback, that they had gained an understanding of       how some features in children's drawings and elements in the drawing       situation can be understood to enable more accurate interpretation of       emotion and communication in children's drawings thus facilitating better       communication with the child.
Follow up exchanges indicated that family       members asked more questions about the child's drawing and encouraged the       behaviour more at home and at work.
The latter outcomes were also       reflected in a small online survey of parents and family members (N=40)       conducted in in April 2013 designed to gather information about views and       practices and feedback about key findings regarding colour use.
94% of the       respondents reported that they would talk more children about the colour       use, preferences and features they draw in order to better understand how       they feel about the topics they draw.
