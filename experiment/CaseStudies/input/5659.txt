     The deep ocean is our planet's largest realm, in which we are all       "stakeholders" through our use of its resources and the environmental       impacts of our everyday lives.
But beyond the research community, there is       limited awareness of deep-sea environments and their biodiversity.
We have       therefore created an integrated programme of public engagement with our       research, to share ongoing discoveries in deep-sea science with a global       audience, and to inspire and inform specific communities of interest and       place with our work.
This programme has been highlighted by Research       Councils UK as an example of "best practice" for generating impact from       research [5.1].
Our public engagement programme combines three elements.
Firstly, we have       worked with the media to share the findings of our research with       non-academic audiences worldwide.
At key milestones in our research       process &#8212; awards of funding, preparation for fieldwork expeditions,       discoveries during fieldwork, and publication of papers &#8212; we have       produced press releases and worked with science journalists to generate       extensive coverage by print, online, and broadcast news outlets [5.2].
In addition, we have collaborated with documentary-makers to produce TV       and radio programmes featuring our findings and research process.
Secondly, we have presented and discussed our research directly with       public audiences through a series of talks and events [5.3].
For       these "face-to-face" engagement activities, we have targeted four       "communities of place" and "communities of interest": (i) our local       communities in the southern UK; (ii) users of the marine environment, at       events such as the Southampton Boat Show; (iii) retirees / life-long       learners, through networks such as Probus and University of the Third Age;       and (iv) school pupils and teachers, including live video links to classes       from deep-sea research expeditions, and contributions to Continuing       Professional Development (CPD) events for teachers.
Our direct engagement       programme has also included the production of exhibits such as a life-size       display of deep-sea hydrothermal vents, to engage people with our research       at venues such as a music festival and a regional airport.
Finally, we have developed a network of resources for online engagement.
This network consists of an interactive website [5.4] enabling       audiences to follow "live" updates from our fieldwork expeditions and ask       questions; Twitter feeds enabling direct dialogue with individual research       team members at sea; a YouTube channel delivering video highlights from       previously unseen deep-sea regions; and free eBooks distributed by iTunes,       WHSmiths.co.uk and other online outlets [5.5].
As the three strands of engagement activities are embedded in our       research process (shown in the timeline summary below), their impacts       during the REF period are underpinned by our most recent research outputs,       rather than earlier papers.
Our direct and online programmes have also       captured feedback from audiences, using a variety of methods from comment       boxes to video interviews, to inform and refine further engagement, and       the benefits of our programme have been two-way, with audiences providing       insights and wider perspectives of issues related to our research.
"Reach" of impact for media engagement activities is quantified by       audience numbers, and coverage of our research has reached audiences of       millions worldwide.
For example, on 11/04/10, an article about our Cayman       Trough fieldwork discoveries was viewed by 1.5 million people on Yahoo!
News, making it the most viewed news story of the website on that day       (source: AP science journalist Raphael Satter [5.6]).
On 28/12/11,       BBC online coverage of our Indian Ocean fieldwork discoveries was viewed       by more than 750,000 people, making it the third most-read article of the       BBC news website on that day (source BBC science journalist Rebecca       Morelle [5.7]).
Our work has featured twice on BBC Radio 4's Today       programme during the REF period, with audiences of 7-8 million, and live       BBC TV news broadcasts on 21/02/13 from our deep-sea fieldwork were       watched by more than 10 million people worldwide (source BBC Science       Editor David Shukman [5.8]).
&gt;      	Summary timeline showing the integration of public engagement         activities with our research during the REF period: months containing         "research milestones" (red); press releases related to research         milestones and resulting media engagement (yellow); continuous direct         engagement activities throughout our research process (blue);         interactive online resources produced during fieldwork (black) that         subsequently build a persistent online presence for engagement (green).
By working with National Geographic TV during three fieldwork       expeditions, our research also featured prominently in a major documentary       series broadcast in more than 170 countries; and following training in       science communication and podcasting, our PhD students recorded audio       material at sea used extensively in two programmes for BBC Radio 4's Costing         The Earth series, with audiences of 1.4 million (source BBC producer       Alisdair Cross [5.9]).
"Significance" of impact for media engagement is demonstrated by (i)       follow-on coverage by other media outlets; (ii) social media shares of       coverage among the public; (iii) feedback comments recorded from audiences       of media coverage; and (iv) testimonials from journalists and producers       with whom we have worked to achieve our engagement goals.
While our team       members gave more than 100 direct media interviews about our research       during the REF period (please see [5.2] for full details),       follow-on coverage has totalled several thousand articles.
For example,       more than 520 online news outlets (tracked by Google News) covered our       Cayman Trough discoveries in April 2010 alone, and other research       milestones achieved similar levels of follow-on coverage.
Social media       shares of coverage among members of the public, which demonstrate       stimulated interest of audiences, exceed tens of thousands; for example,       Facebook "likes", Tweets, Google+ recommends, Stumbleupon shares, and       email forwards tracked for just four articles about our PLoS Biology       paper [3.1] total more than 11,000.
Audience comments on media coverage further demonstrate outcomes of       generating inspiration and curiosity about science, and raising awareness       of our research interests, for example: "It's amazing to see finds         like this" and "So exciting.
How I wish I would have gone into         oceanography".
After covering our research in February 2013, BBC       Science Editor David Shukman reported in his blog that he was "still         picking up messages from people amazed at getting such an extraordinary         vision of the reality of the deep sea".
Testimonials from       journalists and producers also show the significance of our media       engagement, through comments such as "one of the most riveting         television moments for many years" and "one of the best examples         I have ever known of cooperation from scientists" [5.8].
For direct engagement activities, "reach" of impact is similarly       quantified by audience numbers, and we presented and discussed our       research with more than 20,000 people at more than 80 face-to-face events       during the REF period (please see [5.3] for full list), not only       to "science-interested" audiences at caf&#233;s scientifiques and science       centres, but also at less traditional venues for public engagement with       research, such as a music festival and Selfridges in London.
"Significance" of impact for direct engagement activities is demonstrated       by feedback comments recorded from audience members that show outcomes of       stimulating curiosity and raising awareness of our research findings       (presented in [5.3]), such as "I now have 2 children wanting         to be marine biologists!
", "I came home and spent hours Googling         hydrothermal vents", and "Like everyone else I was gripped...         And there is so much more to discover!".
At just one of 13 local schools with whom we have worked in our direct       engagement, we interacted with more than 1,100 pre-GCSE to A-level pupils,       through talks, visits, and the first live video links from a UK research       ship to school classes.
This Comprehensive School has reported a       year-on-year increase in pupils applying to study marine sciences at       University, with staff also noting "a massive and positive impact on         teaching and learning with those groups of students" and that our       contributions to CPD events for teachers "inspired me and many other         teachers to include more contemporary marine science and ocean research         examples in our day-to-day teaching" [5.10].
In three years       of participation in the Wellcome Trust sponsored I'm A Scientist       schools engagement programme, we also interacted with pupils at 30 further       schools, answering more than 400 posted questions, and received a prize       voted for by pupils for the most engaging presentation of research.
In online engagement activities, "reach" of impact is quantified by       visitor traffic to online resources.
Our core engagement website received       more than 279,000 visitors from at least 90 countries since April 2010,       and combined with our YouTube channel and other resources, there have been       more than 1 million visitors to online engagement materials generated from       our research since January 2009 (data summarised in [5.5]).
"Significance" of impact in online engagement is shown by feedback       comments from audiences, and social media shares of online resources among       the public.
Feedback comments on our core website provide evidence of       inspiring and informing audiences with our research (summarised in [5.5]),       such as "This is the coolest expedition and surely the best ever         website for communicating science news to the public" and "This         (baby) Boomer on Long Island (NY) will think far beyond the surf on next         visit to the Fire Island lighthouse".
Public comments on a Guardian       website article (05 July 2013) by one of our team about our fieldwork       include "Fascinating and awe-inspiring" and "Amazing.
Best         article I've read on here today".
Meanwhile, reviewer comments on       our free eBooks include "An excellent read that made me feel like I         was out on the expeditions with them" (GoodReads.com), and       widespread social link-sharing of our online engagement materials among       audiences demonstrates inspiration and stimulation of curiosity (example       data presented in [5.5]),     Overall, using these recognised metrics for reach and significance of       impact in public engagement, our integrated programme has delivered the       defined benefits of generating inspiration and curiosity about science and       raising public awareness of our research insights.
The significant impact       of our public engagement programme has also been recognised by the award       of the Biosciences Federation Science Communication Award for Established       Researchers to one of our team during the REF period, and testimonial       comments from science communication professionals that highlight the       overall skill of our team in engaging wider audiences with our research,       such as "The world of science should treasure clear-voiced ambassadors         like him" [5.8].
