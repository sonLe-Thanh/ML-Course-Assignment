     TrAIN disseminates its findings through curatorial activity, talks,       publications, and engagement with       the Museums and Galleries sector.
Collective outputs have widened       knowledge of the       transnational, informed approaches to commissioning, collecting and       display, and have played a       role in raising awareness and adding a new dimension to the critical       reception of the work of       artists.
Reach and significance is demonstrated by relationships and       partnerships developed with a       range of prestigious museums and galleries and other cultural       organisations including: Tate, V&amp;A,       Iniva (Institute of International Visual Arts), Autograph ABP, Gasworks,       and K&#252;nstlerhaus Schloss       Balmoral.
Since 2008, the Centre's core members have given lectures and       participated in panel       discussions and events at cultural institutions across six continents       including the British Museum,       Camden Arts Centre, the Serpentine Gallery, Tate, V&amp;A, Manggha Museum       of Japanese Art and       Technology, Krakow, the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, Mori Museum       of Art, Tokyo,       Funda&#231;&#227;o Iber&#234; Camargo, Porto Alegre, and Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art,       Kansas City.
The       methodological approaches above are reflected in the following concrete       examples:     Challenging the simplicity of a `Europe and its Others' rhetoric       is evidenced by engagement       with contemporary Brazilian art.
Notable examples are Asbury's curation of       Cildo Meireles's       installation Occasion (2008) with Tate Modern in conjunction with       the artist's retrospective       exhibition, and the co-curation (with Camden Arts Centre) of Anna         Maria Maiolino: Continuous       (2010).
These ideas were also explored in the symposium The Bienal de         S&#227;o Paulo between the         National and the International, for the 28th Bienal de S&#227;o Paulo       (Asbury, Baddeley and Whitelegg).
The questioning of the traditional narrative of modernism as a story         of the West informed the       ground-breaking exhibition Japanese Crossing Borders: Asia as Dreamed         by Craftspeople, 1910s-1945       (2012), for which Kikuchi worked closely with curators at the National       Museum of Modern Art       Tokyo.
Here Kikuchi's research on the creation of a transnational       framework for design history       informed the first post-colonial design exhibition in Japan, tracing       Japanese craftsmen's artistic       relationships with China, Taiwan and Korea, bringing the politically       sensitive subjects of Japanese       colonialism and imperialism into the public domain.
These issues were       examined in the panel       discussion East meets West: Fashion Crosses Continents (2010) at       the Barbican (Watanabe).
The exploration of multilateral national relationships formed part       of two museum-based       symposia: Exhibitions and the World at Large (2009) organised by       Afterall and TrAIN in       collaboration with Tate Britain (Baddeley, Esche); and Global         Exhibitions -Contemporary Art and         the African Diaspora (2010) related to the major exhibition Afro         Modern: Journeys through the         Black Atlantic at Tate Liverpool (Asbury, Dibosa, Tulloch).
Tulloch       curated International Fashion         Showcase: Botswana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone (2012) for the British       Council in collaboration with the       British Fashion Council.
Short-listed for the International Fashion       Showcase Award, it received       praise from the Botswana High Commission for raising `the profile of         Botswana in the United         Kingdom'.
Focus on a single national culture and dissecting its         transnational characteristics       was evident in Tulloch's curation of Handmade Tales: Women and         Domestic Crafts (2010/11) at       the Women's Library, London, which became the venue's most successful       exhibition, attracting       10,000 visitors.
In 2013 Tulloch gave a keynote speech at Yinka         Shonibare MBE: Material         Positions Conference which explored Yinka Shonibare's work in       African diasporic context as part       of the Yinka Shonibare MBE: Fabric-ation retrospective exhibition       at Yorkshire Sculpture Park.
Tate Encounters: Britishness and visual culture       represented an intensive engagement with the         Museum and Gallery sector, reaching a wide cross section of       influential bodies and groups.
Dibosa presented to the Tate for All working group (2008), the       cross-departmental seminar Tate         Think (2009), Tate National (which brings together Directors       and Chief Curators from across Tate),       and participated in a series of working seminars to inform Tate's         Audience Development Strategy,         2012-15.
A month long public programme of screening, talks and       discussions (2009) gathered 72       contributors to consider the projects findings, followed by a policy forum       at Tate Britain attended by       Munira Mirza (now Deputy Mayor of London for Education and Culture); Sandy       Nairne (Director,       National Portrait Gallery); and Baroness Young of Hornsey.
Reference to       the project is made in the       2008/09, 2009/10, 2010/11 and 2011/12 Tate Reports.
During Black       History Month (2008), the       team presented their findings at the Department of Culture, Media and       Sport (DCMS) to over 50       representatives from the DCMS, the Museums and Libraries Association,       museums and galleries,       and other related organisations.
An indication of the significance of this       work is given by Tate         Encounters invitation to discuss their findings in a closed seminar       sponsored by the Arts Council of       England (ACE) organised by the journal Third Text.
This was       followed by ACE commissioning a       Third Text report Beyond Cultural Diversity: The Case for         Creativity, which included input from the       Tate Encounters team.
Dibosa's participation led to his involvement       in a discussion on cultural       diversity on BBC Radio 3's flagship Night Waves programme (2011).
Extension of the understanding of the transnational often takes the form       of interaction with         practising artists seeking to influence critical reception of their       work within the Museums and       Galleries sector.
Since 2006 the Centre has collaborated with the       K&#252;nstlerhaus Schloss Balmoral       on an artist-in-residence exchange programme.
A key consideration in the       selection process is       how an artist's work relates to the transnational production and reception       of artistic practices and       their histories.
Since 2007 they have collaborated with Gasworks on       artists' residences open to       non-UK based artists, aiming to raise questions for individual artists in       relation to the negotiation of       local and international contexts in practice.
Cinthia Marcelle (2009)       residency exhibition was later       included in the 29th Bienal de S&#227;o Paulo after Moacir dos Anjos (TrAIN       Visiting Fellow 2008/9)       was appointed chief curator of the event, and won the Pinchuk Art Centre       Future Generation Art       Prize.
In addition to the formal residencies, artists approach TrAIN with       projects such as Ricardo       Basbaum's Would you like to participate in an artistic experience?
in 2008, following his       participation at Documenta 12.
Asbury has collaborated with       artists on the production of books       (Anna Maria Maiolino and Julio Villani), and articles and essays (Shirley       Paes Leme, Abraham       Palatnik, Angelo Venosa, Maria Nepomuceno, Ernesto Neto, Daniel Senise)       widening awareness       of contemporary Brazilian art.
The degree to which the comprehensive body of expertise within       the Centre is utilised by       museums and galleries is an indicator of significance.
TrAIN researchers       have a `strong continuing         relationship' with the work of Tate Modern (Chris Dercon, Director       Tate Modern) with activity       including collaboration on the organisation of the Mira Schendel       Conference (2012).
Tulloch is       TrAIN/V&amp;A Senior Research Fellow, member of the V&amp;A's Africa         Curators Group, member of the       V&amp;A Contemporary Caribbean Art and Design Group, and on the       acquisitions sub-committee of       the Black Cultural Archives.
Watanabe advised the National Museum, Krakow       on their Japanese       collection (amounting to 7,000 pieces), resulting in an agreement between       the Museum and the       Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto to digitize the collection.
Expertise have       been utilised by Iniva for       events such as Performing Localities and State of Exchange,       2009 (Baddeley), Global Visions,       2010 (Cherry) and Social Fabric, 2012 (Tulloch), and contributions       to Kimathi Donkor: Queens of         the Undead exhibition, 2012 (Tulloch, Dibosa).
Projects underway       with Autograph ABP include       Maud Sulter: Artist, Writer, Curator (Cherry) and Syd Shelton:         Rock Against Racism (Tulloch).
