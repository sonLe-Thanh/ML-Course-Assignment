     Research expertise in motor development and assessment issues have led to       benefits for health and education professionals through provision of       reliable assessment tools that improve support for children and their       families.
The MABC-2 and DASH tests make an impact by:       (1) providing reliable and valid tools with which health and educational       professionals can identify individuals with handwriting and motor       difficulties; and by       (2) opening up access to resources and intervention to help those       identified as having handwriting or motor difficulties and to enable       optimal support from parents and professionals to be planned.
With this       access, those who struggle can gain extra teaching support, `reasonable       adjustments' for assessments and understanding from teachers to boost       their learning and self confidence.
Helping clinicians to identify and assess children and adults with         handwriting and movement difficulties     Only some clinicians using the MABC-2 test engage in research and       publication, so any citation indices will be an underestimate of the       test's use.
However, according to the citation database `Publish or       Perish'10, the MABC-2 test has been used in 192 published       studies since 2008, including 51 in 2013.
This includes clinical work with       different groups of children with movement difficulties including those       born prematurely, those with medical conditions (e.g.
haemophilia,       hypothyroidism) or with developmental disorders (e.g.
Developmental       Coordination Disorder, ADHD, Specific Language Disorder).
The test is very popular in the field of Developmental Coordination       Disorder (DCD), and at the 2013 International DCD conference in Brazil       over 80% of the presented studies on DCD used the MABC-2 for       identification and assessment.
Many of these studies were undertaken by       research practitioners, publishing work emanating from their clinical       practice.
Statements from clinicians and teachers provide further evidence       of impact of the test10:     A Paediatrician at Stanford University, USA says "The MABC-2 is an         extremely important and robust tool for both care providers and         investigators in long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes among high risk         infants.
We are using it in our School Age Follow Up study of extremely         premature infants in the Neuroimaging and Neurodevelopmental Outcomes         Cohort".
The Head Occupational Therapist at West Lothian Children's OT Service,       Scotland says "As part of our redesign work around assessment for         children with DCD, the MABC-2 was considered the tool of choice for the         assessment of motor skills.
This not only allowed occupational         therapists and physiotherapists to gather information about the child's         motor skills, but also provided information that could contribute         towards potential diagnosis".
Children and their families also benefit from test results.
For example,       the mother of a child with DCD says "A thorough assessment of her motor         skills using the Movement ABC-2 confirmed her persistent motor         difficulties and diagnosis of DCD.
These reports were invaluable in         helping both me and my daughter understand the areas which were causing         such difficulties and allowed her and her school to put into place         strategies to help.
She also received 25% extra time in all public exams         and this enabled her to reach her potential"     External recommendation of the tests     The MABC-2 Test has been specifically recommended for use in the European       Guidelines on DCD (Blank et al., 2012)12.
The guidelines were       produced by an independent body of experts in the field, using       research-based criteria to decide on the most suitable tools to use in the       clinical setting.
A Professor in the School of Rehabilitation Science,       Mcmaster University, Canada says "The MABC-2 has become the gold         standard that is now used around the world for measuring and describing         the severity of children with motor impairment".
The SpLD Assessment Standards Committee (SASC)13 for the       assessment of specific learning difficulties (SpLD) in Further and Higher       Education in the UK, have recommended the MABC-2 and DASH tests for use by       specialist assessors and tutors for the assessment of handwriting and       motor difficulties in students.
The DASH tests are the first handwriting       assessment with valid UK norms and demonstrated reliability.
The DASH       tests thus provide the key evidence base with which children and adults       with handwriting difficulties can gain access to special arrangements in       education through primary, secondary, further and higher education.
The DASH tests are also included in the list of resources recommended by       the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) and by Patoss (The Professional       Association of Teachers of Students with Specific learning difficulties       (SpLD)14 that give guidance to teachers applying for Access       Arrangements for their pupils during written examinations (such as extra       time).
A specialist tutor at a college of further education says "we         regularly use the DASH with our students with dyslexia, as part of the         application for extra time in GCSE exams" 11.
Global impact the tests     The original version of the MABC was popular for many years, but had a       limited scoring system and had generally become outdated.
The revised       MABC-2 Test has now taken its place as one of the most popular tests       Worldwide for the assessment of motor competence.
The MABC-2 may be       purchased by individuals who are certified by a professional organisation       recognised by Pearson (the publisher) or who have a graduate qualification       relevant to their profession.
In the UK most purchases are made by health       and allied health practitioners (e.g.
Occupational Therapists and Clinical       Psychologists) working within clinics/centres.
Based on their confidential       sales figures15, Pearson estimates that between Jan 2008-Dec       2012 78,900 assessments have been made using the full MABC-2 kit in the       UK, and a further 11,150 worldwide.
Commercially available translations       include German, Dutch, Spanish, Swedish, Norwegian and Danish, with       translations in preparation for Hong Kong Chinese, Hebrew, Japanese,       Spanish and Portuguese.
Translations are provided by third parties so       sales figures are unknown.
There are few competitors to the MABC-2 test.
The Bruininks-Osteretsky       Test of Motor Proficiency (BOT-2, 2005) is the closest competitor, with       North American norms.
The BOT-2 tests a similar range of motor skills but       has been criticized for inclusion of inappropriate items (e.g.
to test       strength), which can make results hard to interpret.
A similar test with       Australian norms, the McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development       (MAND, 1997) is now outdated and has received similar criticisms to the       BOT-2.
The sales figures for the MABC-2 test demonstrate popularity of the       test world-wide, in the USA, Canada, Australia and around Europe.
The impact of the DASH extends well beyond the UK, with sales in France,       Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, Australia, Canada and India.
The test is       sold mainly to teachers and educational psychologists but also to other       professionals from a range of disciplines.
The test has been translated       into Romanian and requests also made for a Portuguese and Italian       translation.
There are separate kits for the DASH and DASH17+.
Confidential       information from Pearson outlines the sales figures13:       DASH Reach Figures, for the period January 2008 to December 2012       Sale of complete DASH kits in the UK (outside UK in brackets): 3,100 (111)       plus 2,076 (38) packs of record forms.
Estimated number of assessments       based on this = 133,125       DASH 17+ Reach Figures, for the period January 2010 to December 2012:       Sale of complete DASH17+ kits in the UK (outside UK in brackets): 921       (226) plus 226 (2) packs record forms.
Estimated number of assessments       based on this = 34,375       Added to this are sales of the DASH tests to other companies for selling       on, adding an estimated 8,150 assessments.
The total estimated number of       assessments from both DASH tests is thus 167,500.
These figures, together with formal recommendations of the tests by       organisations in health and education demonstrate the substantial impact       in the UK and worldwide.
