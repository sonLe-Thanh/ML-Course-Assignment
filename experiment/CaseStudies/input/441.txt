     The prevention of conflict has become one of the most important       imperatives of development policy - not only because insecurity threatens       well-being but also because it is a major cause of poverty.
As a result of       ODID research led by CRISE, horizontal inequality is widely cited as one       of the key causes of conflict, and thus its reduction has become part of       policy towards fragile states at the major development agencies.
The       concept has also influenced a number of governments and is reflected in a       range of policy documents.
DFID: CRISE research was funded by DFID in order to provide the       evidence base for policy.
It contributed to a shift in DFID development       strategy towards a recognition that existing approaches were not always       appropriate in fragile and conflict-affected states and donor policy       needed to tackle disparities.
As DFID stated in a news item on its website       on 5 January 2012, `by turning the focus of policy towards inequality and       the neglected dimensions of political, social and economic inclusivity,       CRISE's research has had a significant impact on policy making and       development strategy' (see https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dfid-research-strengthening-work-in-conflict-affected-countries-through-research).
The new DFID emphasis was apparent in a series of policy papers,       including the 2006 DFID White Paper Preventing Violent Conflict       which notes that exclusion of social groups and inequality can lead to       conflict (p 14) and cites a 2005 paper on social exclusion prepared by       CRISE for DFID.
The 2010 DFID Practice Paper Building Peaceful States         and Societies [see Section 5: C1] has a new emphasis on       inclusivity, influenced by the research by CRISE among others, and the       first theory on the causes of conflict listed in this paper (Table 1, p       19) is the HI approach.
The ractice paper was supported by a number of       briefings designed to aid implementation of new OECD-DAC Principles         for Good International Engagement in Fragile States &amp; Situations.
Of these, Briefing Paper D: Promoting Non-discrimination [C2]       draws extensively on the CRISE research [R1, R3] (see, for       example, pp 2-5).
OECD: CRISE was involved in helping develop the new OECD-DAC Principles       through a DFID- commissioned consultancy paper on fragile states with the       result that non-discrimination, inclusive development and avoiding social       exclusion formed part of the principles (Principle 6) [C3].
A 2011       OECD publication exploring how far the Principles had been carried out [C4]       found that Principle 6 in particular was on track.
In 2010, Stewart was       asked by the OECD to advise on HIs, and the OECD's 2011 policy guidance Supporting         Statebuilding in Situations of Conflict and Fragility [C5]       makes a number of references to HIs (citing [R3]) and the need to       take them into account (pp 31, 46, 47, 52, 60, 67).
World Bank: CRISE research influenced the work of the World Bank's       Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction Unit, encouraging a shift in focus       from income inequality towards HIs and their link to conflict.
According       to the then-manager of the unit, speaking in an interview about the       research: `[t]he insight from the CRISE work was that we were measuring       the wrong thing' (see http://www.ox.ac.uk/research/social_sciences/projects/investigating.html)     Stewart was asked to contribute a background paper to the World Bank's       2011 World Development Report [C6] and had several       discussions with the main authors in London and Washington.
The report       cites `Horizontal Inequalities and Identity' as one of the theoretical       strands in the literature on conflict on which it draws (p. 75) and notes       HIs among the economic and political stresses that can lead to conflict       (p. 79).
It cites (p. 82) &#216;stby's regression analysis of 55 countries [R3,         Ch 7] and Langer's research on C&#244;te d'Ivoire [R3, Ch.
8],       among other references to the research (eg pp 6, 17, 168, 260).
Stewart was also invited to be a lead speaker at a 2010 World Bank       Headline Seminar entitled Promoting Inclusive Growth and Employment in         Fragile Situations.
The World Bank-prepared report of this meeting [C7]       lists the link between HIs and conflict as the first `key finding'.
Subsequent policy guidance has included `justice' as a critical objective.
United Nations: CRISE was contracted by the UNDP Bureau of Crisis       Prevention and Recovery (BCPR) to co-edit a report on policy in       post-conflict countries [C8].
One of the report's six `key       conclusions' was that sustained post-conflict recovery requires economic       growth that addresses horizontal inequalities (p. xxiii).
The UNDP's 2009       guidance note on Governance in Conflict Prevention and Recovery [C9]       cites [R1] and [R3] and notes that `[a]s Stewart       convincingly argues, the likelihood of social unrest and violent conflict       is higher in contexts with significant political or economic horizontal       inequalities - especially when both types are combined' (p. 3).
CRISE research has also been taken up by the Human Development Report       Office (HDRO) and is drawn on in a number of its flagship global Human       Development Reports.
The 2010 Human Development Report, The         Real Wealth of Nations: Pathways to Human Development, includes       discussion of HIs in its review of human development challenges (pp.
75-6).
The 2011 Human Development Report, Sustainability and         Equity: A Better Future for All, notes the role HIs can play       in the link between natural resources and conflict (p. 76) [C10].
Impact at the national level: Stewart was commissioned by UNDP       Malaysia to review Malaysian policies towards HIs and make recommendations       for future policy.
She reported on her results to government planners in       2011.
She put forward the view that Malaysia should move from an emphasis       on direct to indirect policies towards HIs, but should monitor HIs with       the aim of a continued reduction, while also focusing on regional and       political inequalities.
Her input was `instrumental in framing the       situational analysis and the areas for priorities for the inclusive growth       agenda' to be pursued by the Malaysian government in cooperation with the       UNDP in 2013-15, according to the Assistant Resident Representative       (Programme), UNDP Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei Darussalam.
[C11].
Langer and Stewart were also invited to Kenya for discussions with the       prime minister and his chief economic adviser on policies towards       horizontal inequalities and social cohesion [C12].
Ex- Ghanaian       President John Kufuor, who gave the 52nd Anniversary of Nigerian       Independence lecture in Abuja in September 2012, cited `imbalanced       development involving horizontal inequalities' as an important source of       conflict that was impeding Nigerian progress (see http://allafrica.com/stories/201209190753.html).
This followed a public meeting and media appearances in Ghana by CRISE in       2006     DFID commissioned a special study to ascertain the extent and       significance of horizontal inequalities in Nepal, and subsequently       designed its development programme to target particularly the poorest       regions and poorest groups [C1].
This approach continues in the       World Bank's Poverty Alleviation Fund, which is directed towards targeting       excluded and vulnerable groups.
The lead author of the 2009 Nepal Human         Development Report, State Transformation and Human Development,       stated that the ideas of social exclusion and HIs had `guided the       conceptual framework of the report' (email to Frances Stewart, 2 April       2008).
Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga, former president of Sri Lanka, and now a       prominent member of the opposition, uses the concept of horizontal       inequalities (and cites CRISE work) in her speeches: eg the Thirteenth       Emmanuel Onyechere Osigwe Anyiam-Osigwe Lecture `Unity in diversity;       Building Shared and Inclusive Societies for Peace and Prosperity', 29       November 2012 (see http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2012/11/30/unity-diversity-building-shared-and-inclusive-societies-peace-and-prosperity%E2%80%9D-former).
