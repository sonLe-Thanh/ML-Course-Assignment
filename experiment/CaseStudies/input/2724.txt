     The research outputs of ERPE have directly contributed to establishing       SeeByte's (http://www.seebyte.com/latest-news/)       leadership in autonomy software in the maritime domain.
Over the period       2008-2014, 15 technology licences from ERPE have generated &#163;11 million in       revenues for SeeByte [S1].
SeeByte's SeeTrack Software is the de-facto standard for AUV mission       planning, real-time data processing and post mission analysis in the       military and increasingly the offshore domain for maritime unmanned       systems.
SeeTrack Military is currently sold to 15 Navies worldwide,       including those of the US [S4], UK [S3], Canada, Netherlands and New       Zealand.
It provides full situational awareness and additional tools such       as Automatic Target Recognition.
Based on the research reported in [4],       and a performance training tool based on the work in [5][S2], licence       sales for these products amount to &#163;1.7M for SeeByte Ltd over the last 5       years [S1].
"Professors Lane &amp; Petillot and their University colleagues have         contributed great value to the United States Office of Naval Research         Mine Warfare Science and Technology programs through their sharing of         innovative technology concepts with SeeByte Ltd., who in turn have         provided and continue to provide prototype advanced software systems to         the ONR programs.
SeeByte have played key roles in our Future Naval         Capability developments by providing capable algorithms for our         autonomous underwater vehicle efforts.
These have included algorithms         for tracking and identification of structures in sonar and video,         sensor-reactive manoeuvring capability for autonomous vehicle operations         in complex domains and mission planning and analysis software for         missions involving multiple heterogeneous unmanned systems.
Their         Performance Analysis and Training Tool (PATT), which had its roots at         HWU, is a key element of our algorithm training scheme.
ONR system         development and demonstration has resulted in several systems now in         service in the United States Navy.
Many of these now-operational assets         can trace their fundamental origin to innovative research carried out at         ERPE", Head of Mine Warfare Science and Technology US Office of       Naval Research [S4]     SeeTrack Neptune System [4, 5] is software enabling multiple vehicle       collaboration and planning for mine counter measures using Autonomous       Underwater and Surface Vehicles.
It was recently licenced to the UK MoD       [S3] and the Canadian Defence organisation DRDC, generating &#163;1.6M of       licence, support and engineering sales for SeeByte Ltd.     "SeeByte Ltd has benefited enormously over the years from being able         to access University research outputs and turn them into products that         make a difference in the real world.
The technology transfer was         facilitated by the availability of highly trained graduates as well as         intellectual property.
HWU original research sits at the core of some of         our flagship products, from multiple vehicle collaboration (SeeTrack         Neptune) to Sonar sensor processing (SeeTrack PATT) and autonomous         systems mission planning, monitoring and data analysis (SeeTrack         Military).
Our collaboration remains strong and active.
We expect that         to continue under the new SeeByte ownership, as demonstrated by our         support for Professor Petillot's current Royal Society Industry         Fellowship in SeeByte Ltd", SeeByte CEO [S1]     SeeTrack Co-Pilot productbuilds on the research reported in [1] and is       now the software of choice for smart ROVs.
This work has led to strategic       partnerships being secured by SeeByte Ltd with Soil Machine Dynamics (SMD)       for development of large offshore ROVs, and with VideoRay for small       inspection ROVs.
Both companies are market leaders in their respective       sectors.
The SeeTrack Autotracker product is a system based on the research       outlined in [1] above.
It is the only commercially available pipeline       tracking software enabling autonomous underwater vehicles to inspect       pipelines and generate high resolution video and sonar data to verify       asset integrity.
It has been sold to 5 customers, generating &#163;480k of       revenue in the REF2014 period [S1].
The SeeByte Autotracker product holds the world record for autonomous       pipeline inspection [S6] and is sold worldwide.
The SeeTrack Co-Pilot       product is now the standard software for SmartROV autopilots.
SeeByte's       Autonomous Inspection Vehicle programme (AIV) (operated by Subsea 7)       offers the world's first commercial service for autonomous inspection of       deep-water oilfields.
All of these technologies are also an integral part       of the Autonomous Inspection Vehicle, a multi-million dollar programme in       collaboration with Subsea7, which has provided the first commercial system       for autonomous inspection of deep-water oilfield infrastructure, in       service from Q4 2013 [S5][S7].http://www.rovworld.com/article4343.html     In October 2013, SeeByte was acquired by Bluefin Robotics Inc. [text removed       for publication], with the SeeByte brand to be retained [S10].The combined       companies offer a complete suite of autonomy products for surface vehicles       and underwater vehicles, both remotely-operated and unmanned.
