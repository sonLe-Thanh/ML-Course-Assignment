     LSHTM's research has played a key role in promoting new approaches to       mental health care and       influencing policy-makers and donors, in the following ways.
Informing global and national policies for improving access to mental         disorders.
In 2008, WHO         launched a flagship action plan to scale-up services for mental         disorders (mhGAP).
This         referenced The Lancet mental health series in which Patel played         a leading role.5.1 This         subsequently led to a WHO resolution for a Comprehensive Mental Health         Action Plan approved         by the World Health Assembly in 2013.
In 2011, the Ministry of Health in         India set up a mental         health policy group, including Patel, to write India's first mental         health policy and make         recommendations for the scaling-up of mental health care.
For example,         Patel's research was         extensively cited in the XIIth Plan District Mental Health Programme         which is now being rolled         out throughout the country.5.2        Enabling the launch of global civil society partnerships to advocate         for mental health.
In October         2008, the Movement for Global Mental Health was launched in direct         response to LSHTM's         research and Patel's call to action.5.3 The Movement, a         coalition of individuals and institutions         aiming to improve services for people with mental disorders worldwide,         now has over 3,000         individual and 150 institutional members from over 100 countries.
Increased resources for global mental health.
Grand Challenges Canada5.4         has committed         C$30m for innovations which address the Grand Challenges in Global         Mental Health and the         funding of a Global Mental Health Platform (led by LSHTM) to disseminate         innovations to the         wider communities of policy-makers, practitioners and civil society         stakeholders.
The US         National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has also committed over         US$15m to fund five hubs in         developing countries involving partnerships between researchers, policy         makers and civil society         to implement these Challenges (LSHTM is the lead institution for one of         the hubs).
Both         reference papers co-authored by Patel.
Informing the mental health programmes of development agencies and         NGOs.
Various         international agencies have cited the research of LSHTM as justification         to initiate and expand         their own mental health care programmes.
For example, the World         Federation for Mental Health         (the world's largest mental health NGO) has aligned its global programme         to be consistent with         the research evidence generated by LSHTM and the call to action.5.5        Providing practical tools for mental health care in the field: (i)         Patel's manual, Where There is No           Psychiatrist, published in 2003 and providing practical guidance,         has been translated into more         than a dozen languages.
Since 2010, the manual has been core reading for         a new mental health         nursing training programme in Liberia, and has been used by over 4,000         village doctors in         Bangladesh since 2008.
It is the core mental health manual for MSF         programme staff.5.6 In 2008         permission was given to reproduce the manual as 25,000 CD-ROMs, produced         by WHO and the         Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) and disseminated to agencies         working in emergency         situations.
The message of the value of lay health workers in mental         illness care has been taken         to a wide public audience, for example through a TED talk by Patel5.7         which by end July 2013         has had 353,047 hits.
(ii) A specially appointed WHO guideline         development group, including         Patel, developed guidelines5.8 based in part on LSHTM's         research for the management of mental         disorders.
Since its launch in October 2010, the resulting mhGAP Intervention           Guide has been         rolled out in Ethiopia, Jordan, Nigeria and Panama, and used in         humanitarian settings in Haiti,         Equatorial Guinea, Palestine, Syria and Lebanon.
Establishing global mental health as a discipline for study and         practice.
The research has         prompted several leading international universities to set up teaching         programmes in global         mental health (e.g.
Duke, Harvard, New York University).
Patel has led         or been actively involved         in the establishment of Centres for Public Mental Health in South Africa         (at the Universities of         Cape Town/Stellenbosch) and India (at the Public Health Foundation of         India where he directs         the new Centre for Mental Health).5.9 Patel's work has been         specifically cited by Arthur Kleinman,         one of the most influential thinkers in global mental health: `Medical         students who seem largely         uninterested in academic psychiatric research are flocking to ...         projects inspired by other         models of community care such as those initiated by Vikram Patel and         colleagues [see         www.sangath.com; www.centreforglobalmentalhealth.org].
Among many others, these         approaches appeal to those health professionals and students for whom         social justice and care         for the suffering of the poor are central, and have moral force.
