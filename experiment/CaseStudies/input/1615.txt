     The continued development of Vending machines of the British Isles;         SOUND BANK; Sonic Time         Capsule (2011); and H&#251;rd (2011-2012) through Sound         Diaries has generated opportunities for       public engagement through social media, popular conferences and events,       exhibitions, and       podcast and media appearances.
Vending Machines of the British Isles (2010-2011) was featured at       "Boring 2011", a popular       conference11a, b, and subsequently in episode 60 of the cult       technology podcast `shiftrunstop'11c An       installed version of the work also featured in the audio architecture       exhibition in Beijing and London       11d.
When Ford devised SOUND BANK she was volunteering on BBC Oxford's       cultural magazine       show, "The Hub"12a where she publicised the project in a short       entitled "Sounds from Life".
Additionally, a special edition of SOUND BANK was produced for a       public gallery show in Reading       called "Love is Awesome", and in 2009, Ford published records from       December 2008 daily on her       own website12b as an advent calendar blog-post series.
Site       stats reveal that when SOUND BANK       featured on Ford's site, there were 4,222 hits12c.
SOUND         BANK also drew the attention of Rutger       Zuydervelt, who asked Ford to contribute a text to "Take a Closer Listen"12d,       250 copies of which       were printed and distributed internationally.
SOUND BANK archival       envelopes were handed out to       audience members during a soundwalk co-presented by Ford along with Peter       Cusack and Pascal       Amphoux as part of the "ARTEFACT" festival in STUK, Leuven in 201212e.
Additionally, SOUND         BANK featured in the lecture presentation Ford gave at that event12f.
Different outputs and       incarnations of SOUND BANK have impacted across multiple platforms       &#8212; local radio; gallery       exhibition; web-based projects; books and festival event programmes; all       underpinned by the       research activity of writing textually about sounds on the Sound         Diaries website.
In 2010, Ford attended a meeting about public engagement with the British       Library's "UK Sound       Map"13a.
Sonic Time Capsule was a themed recording       project conceived through Ford's exposure       to the concepts behind the UK Sound Map,13b and recorded sounds       were made available to the       public via the map and an associated audioboo account required for       contributing to it13c.
These       sounds were in 2012 repurposed for a "framework:afield" radio show13d       foregrounding the key       issues around archiving field recordings for posterity in advance of a       related presentation at the       British Forum for Ethnomusicology's conference13e.
The show has       been downloaded 250 times13f       as well as being broadcast on Resonance fm (UK); Concertzender (NL); Radio       Nouspace       (Canada); Soundart Radio (UK); Radio Zero (PT); Radio Mar&#353; (SI); Radio       Campus (BE); WGXC       (US); and Radio Paisagem (Br).
The recordings made for the UK Sound Map by       Ford have to date       received 11,348 listens on Audioboo.fm.
and in May 2011 recordings from       the project constituted       22% of all recordings submitted to the British Library UK sound map       project.
H&#251;rd takes its name from a sound and textiles work presented by       Ford in Cumbria in January       2012, and is part of a series of projects conducted by Ford under the       KNITSONIK moniker14a.
These projects engage stakeholders in the working wool industry through       creative uses of sound.
Sound-based practices highlight the origins of woollen textiles in       distinctive landscapes and social       histories, and different strategies are used to draw shepherds,       mill-owners and hand-knitters into       related discourses.
An exhibition held at Rheged arts centre in January       2012 &#8212; "Wonder of Wool"14b       &#8212; featured a hand-knitted speaker system covered in Cumbrian wool,       entitled "H&#251;rd &#8212; A       KNITSONIK&#8482; PRODUKTION"14c.
Through these speakers, field       recordings later presented on the       Sound Diaries site were played &#8212; sounds largely originating from       the same farms as the wool used       to cover the speakers.
"Wonder of Wool" attracted 2,850 visitors14d,       including a retired shepherd.
She wrote to convey her positive feedback on the show &#8212; specifically       mentioning Ford's work14e.
In       May 2012, Ford used Sound Diaries as a platform for research       during a British-Council funded       residency in MoKS, Estonia14f.
Cumbrian recordings were paired       with new recordings made in       Estonia and presented on Sound Diaries with accompanying texts       reflecting on their differences,       similarities, and cultural significance14g.
This underpinned       the 'cultural exchange' theme of the       residency, providing an invaluable platform for Ford's investigations       concerning relations between       British and Estonian woollen industries; it also partially formed the       basis for a commended ACE       application submitted in 201214h.
Sounds and ideas presented on       Sound Diaries re: links between       wool and landscape were repurposed to give a sonic dimension to the       popular WOVEMBER       campaign website14i.
This has had over 100,000 hits since its       inception in 201114j and Ford's baa-tone       has been downloaded by over 200 users14k.
