     Scraton presented the research and findings to the bereaved and survivors       on 12 September 2012       at Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral.
It was followed by:            An immediate response from the Prime Minister in the House of Commons         who apologised         to the bereaved and survivors for the institutional failures of inquiry         and investigation         exposed by the research.
The apology was replicated by all official         public and corporate         agencies involved.
Extensive and prolonged national and international media coverage of         the research, the         findings and the consequences.
The Director of Public Prosecutions immediately initiated a review         considering the potential         for criminal proceedings.
The Home Secretary's appointment of a criminal investigations team,         led by a former Chief         Constable, to pursue possible criminal individual and corporate         prosecutions.
An IPCC investigation into police conduct during and following the         disaster.
This         investigation is unprecedented in scope &#8212; approximately 140 staff         appointed (IPCC Update         August 2013) and 2,000 police officers from 30 police forces are under         investigation (IPCC         Newsletter Feb 2013).
The Police (Complaints and Conduct) Act 2012 was         fast-tracked to         enable the IPCC re-investigation.
The Attorney General securing the quashing of the 96 accidental death         verdicts in the High         Court with new inquests scheduled for March 2014 before Goldring LJ.
In their public statements the Home Secretary, the Health Minister, IPCC,       Attorney General, High       Court Ruling and DPP recognised that these complex, unprecedented       developments were rooted       in the ground-breaking work of the research team.
In introducing a 5.5       hour House of Commons       debate on the HIP Report, the Home Secretary stated that the revealed       `truth' should precede       `justice'.
The Shadow Health Secretary, Andy Burnham paid "particular         tribute" to Professor       Scraton, without whose "meticulous efforts... the truth of Hillsborough         would never have been         known ... [he] has done a huge service not just to the Hillsborough         families but to this country."
As       Burnham pointed out, "the unique research approach, with the emphasis         on disclosure, not         adversarial argument, [provides] a model for resolving other contested         issues arising from our         past" (Hansard, 22 October 2012, Clmn 796).
These comments were endorsed publicly by the IPCC in noting the "shocking         revelations" within       the HIP Report, and its "forensic rebuttal of the long-standing myth that       the behaviour of fans was       largely responsible for the disaster."
It had provided "compelling new         evidence that many of those         who died [41] might have survived" and "detailed new evidence of         the way in which a large number         of statements were altered during the inquiries that followed" (IPCC       October 2012).
In the High       Court responding to the Attorney General's application to quash the       inquest verdicts the Lord Chief       Justice acknowledged the "mammoth task" and "the commitment and       dedication necessary to       examine and evaluate such a massive body of material" (HM Attorney General       v HM Coroner of       South Yorkshire West and HM Coroner of West Yorkshire West [2012] EWHC       3783 (Admin),19th       December 2012).
In correspondence to QUB's Vice-Chancellor in support of Scraton's award       of the Vice-Chancellor's       Impact Prize, the HIP Chair, Bishop James Jones paid tribute to Scraton's       "important         and unique role ... in writing the report", noting specifically       Scraton's "gift of being both scholarly         and accessible to a popular audience" and his insistence on "rigorous         academic standards while ...         not losing sight of the people most affected."
Letter 20th September       2012).
This was highlighted in Scraton's presentation of the research, Hillsborough:         `Speaking Truth to         Power, to capacity audiences at the Belfast Queen's Festival       (Waterfront Hall 29 October 2012)       and the Merseyside Writing on the Wall Festival (St George's Hall,       Liverpool 12 November 2012).
Scraton's public engagement has been recognised in further media coverage       (Guardian;       Independent; Observer; BBC Panorama)     The eminent lawyer and one of two lead barristers working with families,       Michael Mansfield, QC,       states, "the real significance of the HIP report and the whole process         underpinning it was its         extensive archive analysis and research", without which the Report's       findings "would have been         vulnerable to criticism and detraction... [yet] with it,         the status of its findings are unassailable"       (Letter, 6th September 2013).
Lord Charles Falconer, former Lord Chancellor and the other lead counsel       for the Hillsborough       families concurs "the research supporting the HIP Report was thorough,         detailed and rigorous ....         crucial in challenging popular assumptions about the causes of the         disaster and damaging the         reputation of the deceased and survivors .... also unprecedented in its         consequences for the         reliability of the investigations, inquiries and the inquest verdicts.
It has made a defining         contribution not only to the granting of orders for new inquests but         also to public and political         debate regarding social justice and the rights of the bereaved"       (Letter, 19th September 2013)     Ged Fitzgerald, Chief Executive of Liverpool City Council reinforces the       impact of the research,       stating that : "The University's research work, which was so central         to the Panel's uncovering of the         truth, can be considered to be of international significance and it has         far-reaching         implications....The resilience, determination and thoroughness of the         research team in analysing         the complex mass of documentation must be acknowledged, and they should         take credit for their         pivotal role in this historic piece of work.
The findings have helped         bring a sense of relief to the         bereaved families and survivors alike after suffering 23 years of trauma         and injustice."
(Letter, 18th       September 2013)     The most direct beneficiaries of the underpinning research are of course       the bereaved families and       survivors.
As Margaret Aspinall, Chair of the Hillsborough Families       Support Group (HFSG), stated:     "the failures of health and safety in the stadium's structure and         organisation, the policing, the         emergency planning, rescue and evacuation ... the inadequacies and         inaccuracies of the inquiries.
The medical evidence, the inquests and all the legal processes and those         involved.
It also         exonerated the behaviour of all who died and the survivors &#8212; once and         for all."
