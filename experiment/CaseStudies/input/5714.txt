     Impact Indicators:     Economic and commercial     Impact on Business     - Growth in revenue, growth in employee number, increased         competitiveness:     Bath ASU was originally founded in June 2000.
It supplied ready-to-use       dose-banded cytotoxic drugs to       NHS and private hospitals via third-party suppliers, and was one of the       first fully commercial       organizations to supply dose-banded therapeutics to the NHS.
Following a       management buy-out/buy-in       in April 2006, Bath ASU switched to working as an independent, direct       provider and moved to new,       purpose-fitted premises in Corsham, Wiltshire.
By 2008, Bath ASU employed       30 full time staff and       produced approximately 200,000 products per year with annual revenues of       approximately &#163;5M.
The Managing Director of Bath ASU states [1]: "Since 2008, Bath ASU         has undergone significant         growth.
We now supply over 150 NHS hospitals and pharmacies with upwards         of 500,000 doses of         injectable `specials' per year, employing over 70 full-time staff and         now generating revenues of over         &#163;20M per year.
Bath ASU will continue to expand in the coming years,         with 2,500m2 of new facilities in         the building phase".
Bath ASU now supplies ~30% of the entire UK       commercial compounding market       [1].
- Business creation and change of practice: New Business Sector     Bath ASU played a significant role in the establishing the acceptance of       dose banded cytotoxic       products within the medical profession.
Their promotion of the concept has       been through marketing       initiatives, support for NHS training courses, Bath ASU's own external       training packages and, of course,       promotion through its sales team.
[1]     In addition to Bath ASU, there are now at least 12 other companies       providing dose-banded       cytotoxic products to the NHS [2].
These include a number of `large       pharma' companies, such as       Eli Lilly, Hospira and Baxter, which have changed practice to now supply       several of their own drugs       in a pre-packaged, ready to use, dose-banded form.
- New products:     In 2008, only 7 drugs were available as pre-prepared dose-banded products       [3].
This number has       grown rapidly with 22 cytotoxic drug products being commercially available       from Bath ASU by 2011       [2].
Impact on economy     - Reduced healthcare costs, reduced wastage, reduction in staff         workload:     Early studies conducted by a number of NHS trust hospitals demonstrated       that, if implemented,       dose-banding could result in significant reductions in waste and in       overtime of specialist staff [4].
For example, the introduction of dose-banding in a major Edinburgh cancer       center was shown to       decrease drug wastage to zero and to reduce specialist nurse overtime by       80% [5].
A study that       considered 6 cytotoxic drugs reported that implementation of dose-banding       had reduced direct       costs by 4-14% [6].
In fact, the introduction of dose-banding into the NHS       has had such profound       impact that recent Guidelines published by the NHS North of England Cancer       Network now       recommend that the introduction of dose-banding should be undertaken to       manage chemotherapy       capacity before investing in staff and facilities [7]     Social     Impact on health     - Improved patient care, reduced treatment times, improved quality of       life:     The implementation of dose banding within the NHS is considered to have       many significant       benefits, including [3,7]:            Fewer dose calculation errors.
Reduction in phone calls to prescribers or prescription alterations         for dose-rounding.
Quicker dispensing through use of pre-prepared doses (pre-filled         syringes or infusions).
Administration of chemotherapy on any chosen day is facilitated.
Adoption of national contract pricing for chemotherapy (Scotland).
Rationalisation of demand, with aseptic capacity liberated for more         complex chemotherapy and         more time for clinical duties.
Reduced wastage by re-use of cancelled doses and avoidance of         incomplete vial usage during         production.
Use of smaller syringe sizes making bolus administration easier.
Easier processing of dose reductions at short notice.
Supports treatment of patients closer to home.
Several of the above benefits were quantified in a pilot study conducted       by the NHS at Derby       Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust [8].
This project determined that       implementation of dose-banding       reduced patient waiting times by &gt;60%.
It also determined that the       average time taken to prepare       the drug regime was halved, as was the dispensing time for each dose.
Reach     The vast majority of dose-banded cytotoxic drugs are currently used       within the UK [9]; however, in       recent years, the benefits of dose-banding have begun to be recognized       around the world.
Bath       ASU currently produces pre-prepared dose-banded cytotoxic drugs for use in       the Republic of       Ireland and in mainland Europe [1].
Furthermore, studies in a number of       countries, such as       Australia, have demonstrated the benefits of dose-banding within their own       health-care systems       [10].
