     The NHS National Amyloidosis Centre (NAC) established by Pepys and       Hawkins in 1999 is directly funded by the NHS to provide diagnostic and       clinical management services for the national caseload of patients with       amyloidosis [a].
Patient flow has increased uninterruptedly from       ~40 new patients in 1999-2000.
Within the assessment period, annual       patient flow and NHS funding have increased from 1877 patient evaluations       / &#163;2,239,000 in 2008 to 3444 cases / &#163;5,356,000 in 2013 [b].
Since       2008, 2,950 new and 10,955 completed follow up assessments comprise ~70%       of all UK amyloidosis patients, representng the largest, most diverse       cohort of amyloidosis patients worldwide.
Since 2012, the Centre has       provided an online amyloidosis genetic testing service for the UK [c].
Improving diagnosis.
Our correction of the diagnosis of       amyloidosis (see [3,4]) in about 5% of new cases per year       underpins steady improvement in mortality and outcome measures.
Combining       genetic and proteomic testing with refined immunohistochemistry has       increased definitive amyloid fibril typing, which is key for appropriate       treatment, from ~70% to ~98%.
Our development of CT-SPECT 123I-SAP imaging, as part of       2,100 total SAP scans p.a., enables evaluation of individual organ amyloid       load and localised amyloid deposits in non-visceral sites.
We have       introduced CT-SPECT with 99mTc-DPD scintigraphy, repurposing       this diphosphonate bone tracer for diagnosis, typing and serial evaluation       of cardiac ATTR amyloidosis as outlined in [5], leading directly       to installation of a new NHS CT-SPECT suite in 2012, and new recurrent NHS       funding from April 2012 of &#163;250,000 p.a.
Our sophisticated novel cardiac       MRI for evaluation of cardiac amyloidosis has won a further &#163;250,000 p.a.
of recurrent central NHS funding [b].
Improving disease staging and monitoring.
Our further refinement       and validation of serum biomarkers for staging disease severity have been       adopted by pharma and academia in the first industry and academic Phase       III clinical trials of chemotherapy in AL amyloidosis [d,e].
Recommendations for treatment of AL amyloidosis with the       cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone chemotherapy regimen we reported       [8], and for the new response criteria we reported in [7]       have been adopted in April 2013 guidelines issued by The National       Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), an alliance of the world's leading       cancer centres [f].
Consensus of experts on a modern framework for       clinical trial design and drug development in AL amyloidosis was agreed at       the first Roundtable on Clinical Research in Immunoglobulin Light-chain       Amyloidosis (AL), a meeting sponsored by the Amyloidosis Foundation       (Clarkston, MI, USA) in 2010, and published in 2012 [e].
Improving treatment and survival.
Refined use of serum free light       chain measurements has greatly improved monitoring of responses to       chemotherapy in AL amyloidosis [2].
We have also demonstrated the       feasibility and limitations of solid organ transplantation in amyloidosis.
With careful selection, approximately 2% of patients receive an organ and       outcomes match those in general transplant registries; renal       transplantation in AL amyloidosis, the most serious type, has doubled       during the past 5 years.
Almost all patients with AL amyloidosis attending       the Centre now benefit from combination chemotherapy regimens that include       the novel proteasome inhibitor agent, bortezomib.
This and other new high       cost, high efficacy drugs, licensed in the past 6 years for treatment of       myeloma, are available on the NHS to almost all patients with AL       amyloidosis as a direct result of our published clinical research work [g],       which completely changed the chemotherapy paradigm.
Enforcement of the       necessary funding was achieved in association with the British Society of       Haematology, the UK Amyloidosis Network (led by us) and crucially the       patient support charity, Myeloma UK.
Survival of AL amyloidosis patients       under the care of the National Amyloidosis Centre has improved       substantially during the past 12 years: (NAC figures: 4 yr survival 2001-3       was 34%; 2004-7 was 38%; 2008-2012 was 50%).
The Centre's advances are rapidly disseminated to specialist centres and       collaborations internationally through scientific/medical publications,       international meetings and personal contacts.
We established the UK       Amyloidosis Network (2009) attracting over 150 participants at the       February 2013 annual meeting [h], and the ONS-based epidemiology       study of amyloidosis incidence (~5-10 per million p.a.
in England),       enabling clinical service development in the UK.
We lately created the UK       Amyloidosis Awareness Group (UKAAG) with whom the NAC has developed a       comprehensive website [h, i] patient information literature and a       regular newsletter to enable patient and public engagement and promote       awareness of this rare disease.
Myeloma UK have confirmed: "The recent         creation of UKAAG has been warmly welcomed and has given patients an         important platform to formally feed in their views about their treatment         and care.
In particular the creation of a comprehensive website with         high-quality information about amyloidosis, that can be trusted 100%,         provides a great deal of comfort."
[i]     The Centre has received charitable donations from patients, relatives,       friends and other supporters, as direct gifts and via wide ranging       charitable fund raising events organised entirely by donors, enabling       flexible support for new research and patient care initiatives in the       Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins and National Amyloidosis       Centre; total funds donated are over &#163;1.2 million [j].
