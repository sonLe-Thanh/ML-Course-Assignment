     Following the publication of the primary paper in 1996, the University       recognised the huge potential of this technology and invested heavily in a       proto-start up business based in The Heath Business and Technical Park in       Runcorn employing a Manager (Dr. Dare) and technical support (Helen       Sutton).
The initial work of this business involved creating a database of       spectra of microorganisms.
This database was licensed to a number of users       worldwide resulting in an income stream to the University.
Unfortunately,       the intellectual property rights of the technology had not been fully       protected and the University has been unable to further exploit its       commercial potential.
However, MMU's research has underpinned a huge and       significant growth in MALDI-TOF-MS technology with myriad applications and       potential life-saving developments emerging frequently.
This case study is       concerned with existing clinical benefits and the economic impact that the       research has had on technological solutions since 2008.
Clinical Benefits of MALDI-TOF-MS     The clinical benefits of MALDI-TOF-MS are considered revolutionary       as it leads to faster, more accurate diagnosis of microbiological       conditions, saving valuable time that can, in turn, lead to the saving of       lives.
MALDI is also a cost-effective solution as it cuts down on the time       and resource needed to take effective decisions.
As one Unit Head (Lead       Scientist) at Public Health England states [A], "I have worked         with MALDI for many years from the first realisation of its application         to medical microbiology by yourself (Edwards-Jones) until the present         day.
I've seen MALDI become a major technological innovation which has         had a major impact in medical and public health microbiology.
This is in         the rapid and cost effective identification of microorganisms which may         allow improved patient management.
The true potential of MALDI will         impact further in medical and public health microbiology with the         application for the rapid identification and confirmation of foodborne         pathogens and hygiene indicator organisms and indeed may rewrite some of         the accepted dogma around organisms detected in the context of public         health microbiology.
Furthermore, the contribution of MALDI for the         rapid and cost effective identification and confirmation of antibiotic         resistance may become a major tool in the armoury to fight emerging         antibiotic resistance such as Extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing         bacteria and more recently carbapenamase producers.
MALDI-TOF MS has         been little short of revolutionary in its uptake in medical microbiology         and will continue to do so for years to come."
Another senior manager from within the Bacteriology Department at       Sheffield Hospitals Trust [B] explains how "the introduction of         MALDI-TOF-MS has proven to be the most important improvement in clinical         bacteriology during my 30 year career" (even surpassing the       introduction of molecular techniques).
He explains that its introduction       has had a direct impact on patient care and that the "accuracy and         usefulness of the technique has become accepted in clinical         microbiology" replacing other traditional techniques that could take       a minimum of 24 hours.
The cost benefits to the public purse are also       significant.
At the Sheffield Hospitals Trust the cost of an       identification has come down from &#163;3 to 10p [B].
The most profound       impact, according to this senior manager is the dramatic improvement in       the management of conditions for bacteraemic patients where the       preliminary antibiotic choice is critical.
"MALDI-TOF-MS allows         identification of a positive blood culture organism within 20 minutes,         which in turn leads to a more scientifically based decision on which         antibiotic to prescribe."
Commercial Impacts       MMU's pioneering research ultimately led to two industrial organisations       launching their own database and identification system: Bruker Daltronics       with the software Biotyper, and BioMerieux, who partnered with Shimadzu       and Saramis to produce the system VITEK MS.     Bruker       Developed in 2006, there are approximately 800 MALDI Biotypers installed       worldwide at an approximate unit cost of &#163;100K each.
Bruker's MALDI       Biotyper has been designed to be as robust and easy to perform as       possible.
No experience with mass spectrometry is required.
This       industrial application is therefore transforming microbial identification       in laboratories across the world bringing significant cost savings to the       healthcare industry on a global scale.
Biomerieux     Biomerieux produced the VITEK MS system in 2011 and there are approximately     400 devices installed worldwide (source: ProteoMonitor website 2013     http://www.genomeweb.com/proteomics/biomerieuxs-vitek-ms-wins-fda-clearance-firm-battles-bruker-us-clinical-microbio     [D]).
In 2013 Biomerieux's VITEK device was cleared for clinical     roll-out across the United States following rigorous testing that concluded     that "This technology will revolutionise approaches to traditional microbial     identification.
Combined with rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing we     can now provide diagnosis and treatment options within a time frame that     will reduce morbidity and mortality" (source: http://www.biomerieux.com/en/biomerieux-announces-us-fda-clearance-vitekr-ms-revolutionary-technology-which-reduces-microbial)     Research in this area has exponentially increased since the first two       publications in 1996 and as the system is now selling globally, the       potential to move into other sectors, any with a biological threat, is       clear.
There is current research into identification of reproducible       biomarkers directly from specimens and production of algorithms that can       mine the large volumes of data produced by this technique.
The technique       is being used to look at molecules and markers on cancer cells.
Professor Edwards-Jones continues to research into new applications of       the technique and is conducting research designed experiments on multi       drug resistant organisms such as MRSA.
