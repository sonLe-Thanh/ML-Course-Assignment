     The beneficiaries of the underpinning research have been:            Merck's Liquid Crystals business unit, which increased turnover by         8.0% to &#8364;1,094 million in 2011 from &#8364;1,013 million in 2010.
"This         [growth] stemmed from the ongoing demand, particularly for IPS (in-plane         switching) technologies for smart-phone touch-screens and PS-VA         (polymer-stabilized vertical alignment) as well as VA (vertical         alignment) technologies for TV displays.
"[A,B]        Manufacturers of LCDs, who produced LCDs worth $99.4 billion in 2011         rising to a turnover of $107.7 billion in 2012 including 216 million         LCD-TVs.
[C-G]        Micron Technology, USA, and Forth Dimension Displays, UK, which are         the two main manufacturers of F-LCOS microdisplays in a market worth         $250 million in 2011.
[H,I]        Kingston Chemicals Limited, which had a turnover of &#163;200k in 2011.
The users of devices with VAN-LCDs, such as banks, who benefit from         the significantly lower energy consumption of LCDs (10%-25%) compared to         that required for CRTs.
[J]        Purchasers of consumer devices, such as LCD TVs, laptops, with better         LCD screens.
The two LCD applications that have benefited most from liquid crystals       based on the ortho-difluorophenyl unit developed and optimised at       the University of Hull during the assessment period, in collaboration with       the MoD and E. Merck, are VAN-LCDs for LCD-TVs, which is a multi-billion       pound market involving very large LCDs in TVs and laptop computers, and       F-LCOS LCDs, primarily used in camera viewfinders, which is a niche, but       very important market, using small LCDs.
Vertically Aligned Nematic       technology encompasses several variants, such as Polymer-stabilised-,       Multidomain- and Patterned-VA-LCDs.
[D-F]     VAN-LCDs have replaced bulky cathode ray tube displays as well as earlier       LCDs and provide the majority of the 216 million LCD-TVs sold in 2012,       from manufacturers such as Samsung, Sharp and Sony.
[C] The       advantageous VAN-LCD technology is increasingly (2008 to present time)       being employed in smaller displays for desktop and laptop displays, which       is a very high volume market.
Additionally, because of the lower power       consumption and cheaper production costs, VAN-LCD technology is now being       introduced into the mobile phone and tablet markets.
No other current       design of material can match those based on the ortho-difluorophenyl       unit for the combination of liquid crystallinity, low viscosity and high       negative dielectric anisotropy required for VAN displays.
[D-G]     "Liquid Crystals generate more than 70% of the [E. Merck performance         materials] division's sales [&#8364;1,719 million].
Based on a market share of         between 50% and 60%, this business has for many years commanded the         number one market position for liquid crystal mixtures used in liquid         crystal displays (LCDs).
With the broadest offering in the industry, the         business unit's product portfolio comprises liquid crystals tailored to         match the individual requirements of the full range of LCDs, from small         displays in smart phones to ultra-large televisions.
The portfolio         includes liquid crystals based on polymer stabilized vertical alignment         (PS-VA) technologies, primarily used in mid- and large-sized         televisions, as well as liquid crystals based on in-plane switching         (IPS) technology, which are also used in televisions as well as         increasingly in mobile devices such as tablet PCs and smart phones.
The         Liquid Crystals business unit operates in a highly consolidated market         with a total of only three suppliers, indicating the high barriers to         entry as a result of the scientific complexity of liquid crystals and         their high quality requirements.
Liquid Crystals supplies all seven         major LCD panel manufacturers that serve television manufacturers or         other consumer electronics companies.
"[B]     The ortho-difluorophenyl unit is also present in smectic       liquid crystals, developed and optimised at the University of Hull in the       assessment period, that are essential components of smectic       mixtures used in Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal on Silicon (F-LCOS)       microdisplays, which are small LCDs with a cell thickness of less than a       micron.
The amount of liquid crystal material used is very small when       compared with that used in VAN-LCDs, but nevertheless the commercial       impact is still very significant.
F-LCOS microdisplays provide very high       resolution and extremely fast switching, and are employed in head-mounted       displays for training simulators and computer games, and in camera       viewfinders for the film, military and medical industries.
The high       value-added nature of the liquid crystals used in F-LCOS microdisplays       provides an ideal business for Kingston Chemicals Limited, which       manufactures ortho-difluorophenyl liquid crystals and formulates       ferroelectric liquid crystal mixtures containing them for Display Tech and       Forth Dimension Displays.
Citizen Finetech Mijota Japan, which now owns       Display Tech,[H] and Forth Dimension Displays, are two of the       main manufacturers of F-LCOS microdisplays in a global microdisplays       market expected to reach $995 million by 2016 from $250 million in 2011.
