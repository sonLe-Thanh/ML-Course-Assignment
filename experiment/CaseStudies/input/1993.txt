     LHSA introduced a new way of understanding local housing systems and led       to a change in the way that local authorities are required to justify       public investment.
LHSA was formally endorsed by the then Scottish       Executive through implementation of the 2001 Housing (Scotland) Act, which       established the preparation of local housing strategies as a statutory       local authority duty and required these be informed by an evidence-base       created by an LHSA process.
The current guidance for housing needs and       demand assessment laid down by the Scottish Government continues to draw       strongly on the LHSA framework.
Current English (and Welsh) housing needs       and demand assessment guidance also explicitly acknowledges a continuing       debt to LHSA.
Alongside the original 1993 Guidance, Glasgow academics produced LHSA       case studies for Edinburgh and Rural Dunbartonshire.
Subsequently, when       Local Housing Strategies became a statutory requirement after 2001,       Glasgow University contributed to teams that carried out the entire LHSA       requirement for West Lothian and the rural example of the Western Isles.
In each case the complete process of LHSA was undertaken: review of       planning and policy documents, assessing the appropriate geography for       study, undertaking a data audit, undertaking analysis of external drivers,       examining each tenure and their key interactions before identifying key       long-term problems or imbalances.
The final reports were used by the local       authorities in these regions as an evidence base which underpinned and       shaped their Local Housing Strategies and forward planning initiatives.
The main impacts of the research, therefore, centre on the application of       the research to develop good practice guides to enhance the practice of       housing professionals; the extensive influence of the research on the       training of housing analysts, researchers and policymakers on LHSA; and       the subsequent positive impact that these activities have had on the       effective planning and management of social housing, with the research       informing the Local         Housing Strategies of numerous local authorities and housing       providers.
Essentially, LHSA has influenced two decades of public sector       housing investment decisions.
Influencing the formation of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001:     As noted above, the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 enshrined in law a       requirement that all local authorities produce a local housing strategy       that was informed by an evidence-base from an LHSA process.
The research       influenced the forming of this legislation by virtue of Maclennan being       invited to chair the Single Housing Plans Group (SHPG), which was       established in February 2000 during the drafting stages of the Housing       (Scotland) 2001 Bill.
The SHPG was tasked with taking forward a Housing       Green Paper proposal for a single housing plan for each local authority       area.
Membership of the group comprised representatives from the Scottish       Executive, Scottish Homes, COSLA, local authorities, the Scottish       Federation of Housing Associations and the Chartered Institute of Housing.
The impact of the new law was evident right up until and into 2008 when       changes were made to the local housing strategy requirements; significant       elements of LHSA remain in the approach and the guidance continues to form       part of the cluster of materials adopted by the Scottish Government's       Centre for Housing Market analysis.
Production of Good Practice Guides for local authorities:     On the basis of the LHSA research, GU researchers were commissioned by       Communities Scotland to co-produce LHSA Good Practice Guides to provide       practical assistance to Local Authorities on how to carry out LHSA.
In       preparing these Guides, titled, Local Housing Systems Analysis: Good         Practice Guide, the research team contributed to Local Authorities'       processes for assessing need and ensuring the effective provision of       social housing.
The researchers produced successive versions of these Good       Practice Guides in 1993, 1998 and 2004.
The subsequent development of Scottish Housing Needs and Demand       Assessments (HNDAs), by the Scottish Government in 2008 drew heavily on       the LHSA model in its guidance.
This is evident in the HNDA Guidance where       it states that it is based upon the Local Housing Market Assessment         Guide of the Welsh Assembly 2006, which was prepared by the research       team using the LHSA model; and on the Strategic Housing Market         Assessments: Practice Guidance, Communities and Local Government       2007, which explicitly states that it is `based upon the Local Housing         Systems Analysis Best Practice Guide, Communities Scotland, 2004',       which was also based on the LHSA research.
Delivery of training courses for practitioners in Scotland:     In addition to producing new guidance for housing professionals, members       of the research team wrote and delivered successive waves of training       courses to staff at Scottish Homes; Communities Scotland; Scottish       Office/Executive staff; housing associations; and local authorities in       Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh.
The team carried out several rounds of       this 2-day and 3-day training courses, which involved:            Conceptualising housing as a system and exploring its practical         implications       Undertaking data audit and sources of housing data       Housing market geography       LHSA and economic analysis       The meaning of housing need       Housing needs assessment       Drivers of housing change       Balance and imbalance.
The training involved a mix of plenary sessions and practical exercises.
Training courses were provided around both the 1998 and 2004 guidance       publications (largely to councils, Scottish Homes and Communities Scotland       staff but also Government, housing association and other housing       specialists).
Training was also organised with the Scottish Housing Best       Value Network (twice in 2007 and 2010) and for Glasgow city council staff       transferring to Glasgow Housing Association.
Each session, either 2 or 3       days long, was attended by 25-30 delegates i.e.
around 200-240 delegates       in total.
Extension of Reach - NI and Wales:     The demand for guidance and training in LHSA extended beyond public       bodies and local authorities in Scotland and over the period from 1993 to       2011 the Glasgow University researchers developed analogous LHSA Good       Practice Guides for the Welsh Assembly and undertook extensive research       and training with the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.
Influencing housing strategies in Northern Ireland:     Most recently (2007-12), Young, O'Sullivan and Gibb, carried out a       comprehensive, major study of Greater Belfast and a mini-LHSA study for       the town of Larne, for the Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE).
The       Head of Research at NIHE stated that the University of Glasgow research `identified         potential future imbalances in the Northern Ireland's housing market,         enabling scarce resources to be targeted in a more meaningful way'.
The Belfast study involved identifying appropriate geographical areas for       study, developing a good practice guidance report and conducting a       systematic case study of Belfast alongside training delivered by members       of the research team in Belfast in 2010-11.
The Head of Research at NIHE       further explained that this training ensured that `the planning teams         were equipped to undertake LHSA for the remaining 10 housing market         areas'; additionally, the Head of Research went on to affirm that:     [T]hese key strategic research studies have had a major influence on         the development of housing strategies and the social housing programme         in recent years.
The fact that our strategic and area planning teams         have recently begun their three-yearly review and update of the current         11 LHSAs must be seen as a testament to their impact on government         policy and strategy in relation to planning for housing in Northern         Ireland in recent years.
Thus, confirming the continued significance and value of the LHSA       research to the work of NIHE.
