     a) Music in schools: Showing that all children have equal       potential to benefit from engagement in music was a key contribution of       this research (Lamont et al., 2003).
These findings have been taken up       widely by the education and training community, as illustrated by a recent       Teaching Music editorial (2012) and numerous on-going debates       around music qualifications.
The evaluations of initiatives designed to       foster musical inclusion (e.g.
Lamont et al., 2012) have informed public       debate about the broader value of the arts; Lamont has been invited to       share and debate the research findings in a number of forums (e.g., Battle         of Ideas, London; International Research in Music Education       conference (keynote), Exeter).
Her argument about the myths of musical       talent across the lifespan has fed directly into teacher training events,       e.g.
Nigel Scaife, Syllabus Director of the Associated Board for the         Royal Schools of Music has used the research in his sessions at the       ABRSM conferences (e.g.
October, 2012 attended by over 380 instrumental       and vocal music teachers.
The importance of this research conducted in       England has had a wider international impact; Singapore's Teachers         Academy for the Arts, a professional consortium of art and music       teachers, refers to this work as the starting point for their own       initiatives (STAR, 2013), indicating that these findings have shaped the       policy debate beyond England.
b) Community arts and older people: According to self-reports, the       research on community arts had an immediate beneficial impact on the older       participants but also on the wider community through the various       exhibitions and associated events (details on a number of websites (see       examples in section 5)).
The exhibitions attracted over 100 local       residents, community partners, and city councillors, and were reported in       the local press (e.g., Manchester Evening News, 17 July, 2010; This         is East, 10 July, 2010).
The project newsletters produced broader       awareness of the project especially among community workers as evidenced       in follow-up discussions.
At the close of the project a policy document       based upon the key findings was produced to promote discussion among       Manchester City Council (MCC) officials and community partners.
This       detailed the main project findings about the social and psychological       benefits of arts and creative activities for older people and the local       steps that could be taken to sustain community interventions.
The key       article (Murray &amp; Crummett, 2010) and policy document were discussed       fully with MCC officials, at various ageing forums in Manchester (e.g.
Full         of Life Festival, 2010), and at the Local Government Association       conference (2011).
They were used by city officials in the development of       the Manchester Age Friendly City plan and the city's Cultural         Offer for Older People.
They were also used by MCC staff in their       contributions to broader discussion, e.g., the launch of the EU         Year of Active Ageing in Copenhagen (2011) and the World Health         Assembly in Geneva (2011).
Murray was invited to discuss the       research findings at the Ageing Artfully conference (Manchester,       2011) and at the Arts &amp; Health conference (Stoke-on-Trent,       2011).
These events attracted several hundred participants from community,       arts and older people's organisations.
Broader impact in the       international policy arena is evident in the many invitations to give       keynote presentations at conferences, e.g.
Health for All       (Leipzig, Germany, 2011), Annual Citizen Participation Conference       (Barcelona, 2010), International Congress on Culture, Health and         Wellbeing (Turku, Finland, 2011), and European Culture Forum       (Brussels, 2013).
C) Older people's participation in choirs: The recommendations       from the work on the value of participation in music by older people       (Lamont, Murray &amp; Hale, 2010) have been enthusiastically adopted by       MCC with music and the arts now a central plank of their Valuing Older       People (VOP) programme.
We continue to be involved in discussion with MCC       about the implications of this research.
The potential for music to be       used for wellbeing in later life and the importance of music in the       community has also attracted interest in local community groups, as       evidenced for example by invitations from Croydon's Caf&#233; Scientifique       (in 2008), Broughton Women's Institute (in 2012) and the Soci&#233;t&#233;         France-Grande Bretagne in Cahors, France (in 2013).
These community       organisation talks have provided a means of promoting greater acceptance       of the value of music and arts activities disseminating research findings       to the general public.
This work was detailed in the Mental Health       Foundation report on the value of creative activities for older people.
d) Role of theatre in older people's lives: One of the outputs of       this project was a new docu- drama &#8212; `Our Age, Our Stage' &#8212; as       well as an exhibition and resource pack.
These outputs were derived from       the archival and interview material collected for the project.
The play       was performed to a capacity audience of 400 people at the New Vic Theatre       in July 2012 by a group of older people who had been interviewed for the       project supplemented by members of the New Vic Youth Theatre.
This was       extended through the performance road-show which has played to over 700       people at schools, colleges, retirement communities, local councils and       has been invited to perform at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, Birmingham       Repertory Theatre, and Manchester City Council Arts &amp; Ageing Festival.
Evidence for the positive impact on the participants was apparent in the       written feedback and in follow-up discussion.
The project also attracted       substantial interest in the local newspapers (e.g.
The Sentinel       4/12/09 and 26/05/11).
A 12 month follow-on project has been funded by the       AHRC which has enabled us to establish the Ages &amp; Stages Theatre       Company and to devise a new interactive forum theatre piece on ageing.
Initial discussion about a Creative Age Festival attracted interest from       over 20 arts organisations in North Staffordshire.
