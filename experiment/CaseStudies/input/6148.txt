     Dr. Miller research has led to invitations to contribute to radio       programmes (e.g.
BBC Radio 3, A Bridge Between Two Worlds), public       lectures and conference papers.
Opportunities such as these enabled her       work to impact on a wide audience through intellectual engagement and peer       review.
The subsequent impact of participating in these events is       evidenced by the following invitations to publish: her contribution to Arte         &#233; Moda (2012, edited by Marco Pedroni and Paolo Volonte), which       resulted from her conference paper `Fashion is a craft that must be         carried out with the greatest precision (Gabrielle Chanel)',       Catholic University, Milan, May 2012; her contribution to `Mobility and         Fantasy in Visual Culture (2013, edited by Lewis Johnson) originated       as a conference paper delivered at Bahcebeshir University, Istanbul (May,       2011); the paper also led to an an invitation to give the same paper at a       conference organised by the Pasold Research Forum entitled Innovation         Before the Modern &#8212; Cloth and Clothing in Early Modern World, held       at the Nordiska Museet, Stockholm, September 2012.
The following commissions demonstrate the importance and impact of Dr.       Millers previous publications and will provide yet further opportunities       for her research to generate new ways of thinking that will influence       theory and practice with regard to academia, the creative industries and       public engagement with the humanities:             Fashion Writing and Criticism (with Professor Peter McNeil,         University of Technology, Sydney, Australia) commissioned by         Berg/Bloomsbury.

Professor Owen's e-monograph is the first publications in 250 years to       analyse the symbolic content of Roman wall-painting.
Previous publications       have hitherto primarily focused on purely formal issues that contextualise       the paintings in relation to display and status.
According to Google       Analytics it is, on average, consulted in 50 Countries and 270 cities.
In       some instances daily readership has reached the near 200 mark when the       site has been incorporated into, or promoted by, external events, such as       exhibitions on Pompeii or Roman art in general.
Reader's comments range       from insightful gratitude to requests for more specialist information in       support of their studies.
Professor Wilks' long-term research on Henry, Prince of Wales led to his       2-year involvement, as chief consultant, for the `Lost Prince' exhibition       at the National Portrait Gallery, London (Nov. 2012 - Jan. 2013).
The       exhibition relied heavily on his unrivalled knowledge and insights and was       visited by 30,000 people and achieved extensive public impact by being       featured in BB2 and BBC4 documentaries, Channel 4 News, Radio 3 In         Tune (twice), and by being prominently reviewed in the national       press, e.g., The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph, and was       chosen as the front cover feature review for an issue of the Sunday         Times Culture Magazine.
This wider impact is confirmed by the       dedicated website - 65,000 hits, and by Social Media analysis conducted by       the NPG.
Wilks co-authored the exhibition's 192-page catalogue (3,500       copies sold in the first year), which as well as introducing Prince Henry       to a new audience presents this Renaissance prince as an object of       cultural memory.
The exhibition strongly conveyed Wilks' emphasis on the       fashioning and re- fashioning of Prince Henry in a cultural-memory       context; and his research theme concerned with examining the tension       between the importance of knowing the iconicized prince and Henry the       person.
Reflecting the success of this attempt to communicate such ideas,       a previous Booker prize-winner commented... "one of the most fascinating       and moving exhibitions I've ever seen; every single thing in it of       absorbing interest, and a (to me) virtually unknown story.
It seemed to me       such a model of what an exhibition should be &#8212; indeed almost to take such       a thing into a new dimension of cultural/historical/artistic narrative."
As a result of his involvement with the Henry exhibition he is now       acting as consultant to the virtual-reality company LightMix Ltd, who are       involved in recreating the lost gardens in Prince Henry's Richmond Palace.
His previous publications "Plundered Art", Lord Dingwall, &amp;       The Lost Prince, also confirmed Wilks as an authority on the role       of art and cultural memory in conflict situations in the Early-Modern       period, as result he is contracted to write an 8,000-word essay &#8212; "The Art       and Architecture of War, Revolution and Restoration" in The Oxford       Handbook of the English Revolution, ed.
Michael Braddick (OUP,       forthcoming, 2014).
He has also been asked to enlarge on themes introduced       in his Introduction to The Lost Prince in a commissioned       8,000-word essay &#8212; "Prince Henry and the Politics of Expectation" in The         Age of Shakespeare, ed.
