     The West Midlands has consistently reported above the national UK average       for overweight and obese children based on National Child Measurement       Programme (NCMP) data with, for example, 21.2% of year 6 pupils measured       being recorded as obese for the year 2011/12 (against a national average       of 19.2%).i Weight management programmes are a key part of the         strategy adopted by West Midlands Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) to combat         this problem.
A significant contribution of the research has been to         improve the delivery of child weight management programmes by PCTs         across the West Midlands.
In addition, it has led to changes in practice         relating to the NCMP and it influenced the development of the         Worcestershire Childhood Obesity Strategy and Action Plan 2008-11.
The evaluation study was central to the first of these impacts (though it       must be stressed that this study itself was underpinned by Peters'       previous work on the value of anthropometrical measures).
Key outcomes of       the evaluation were a set of recommendations for commissioners of weight       management programmes (Source A) and a toolkit of validated       measures for use by programme leads (Source B).
In February 2010,       the research team presented the findings from the evaluation at a workshop       held by the Department of Health West Midlands (DoHWM) which was attended       by 65 weight management programme leads, commissioners, health improvement       specialists and others involved in developing, running and evaluating       public health interventions from across the region (Source C).
DoHWM published a document in March 2011 setting out the legacy of its       Healthy Weight programme which describes in detail the impact of the       evaluation (Source D).
At a general level, it is stated that the       evaluation enabled Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) to improve measurement, data       collection and evaluation within their programmes (with concomitant       benefits for those children and families engaged in the programmes);       reassured PCTs that they were commissioning effective programmes; led to       PCTs adopting the National Obesity Observatory's Standard Evaluation       Framework (SEF) when making commissioning decisions.
More specifically,       one PCT specified that the SEF and the University of Worcester's       evaluation tools and findings must be used by service providers.
The same PCT also used the evaluation and associated tools for their       revised NCMP service.
Another PCT decided to pilot their own in-house       child weight management programme, incorporating best practice identified       through the evaluation; while another decided not to continue funding       their current programme which had been evaluated as part of this.
Perhaps       the key overarching impact is that all West Midlands' PCTs accepted the       recommendation that they should continue to invest in child weight       management programmes.
The research relating to school-day variation in weight and height has       been fed into the practice of PCTs in data collection for the NCMP.
Peters       contacted PCTs directly with the outcomes of the research and a number       responded to state that they would in future be recording whether       measurements were taken in the morning or the afternoon such that       school-day variation could be built into the outcome statistics (Source         E).
More generally, Peters' expertise led to him being invited to sit on the       Worcestershire Childhood Obesity Strategy Group in 2008-9 (Source F).
Within this Group, Peters held particular responsibilities for research,       specifically relating to childhood obesity intervention programmes which       are set out in the final version of the strategy and associated action       plan (Source G).
