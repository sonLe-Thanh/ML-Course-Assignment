     Route-based weather forecasting (RBF) is being increasingly adopted by       local authorities and other organisations to help achieve more efficient       and effective operational delivery of winter resilience measures.
In the       case of highways authorities, it assists them in meeting their statutory       responsibilities under the Highways Act 1980.
Highways authorities         with some of the most extensive road networks in the UK are now making         use of this approach and requiring it be embedded when they procure         weather forecasting services.
Therefore, although the approach was       launched prior to 2008, it has moved on from the development stage to       wider implementation and is now delivering impact in economic terms for       highways bodies, leading to reduced disruption and improved safety for       road users and contributing to reducing losses from winter weather for the       UK economy.
The importance of winter resilience measures, and the risks       associated with the issue, was illustrated recently by the challenging       weather experienced in the UK in 2008/9 and 2009/10; the subsequent       government report estimated the costs of winter weather disruption at       around &#163;1 billion annually [source1].
Attribution chain: The benefits being achieved from RBF can be       strongly attributed to the research undertaken by Chapman and Thornes.
In       direct terms, their patented method was utilised by the University's       spin-out company ENTICE Technology Ltd and subsequently sold to WSI in       2006.
Evidence of the attribution of ENTICE's work to this research group       can be found in a report published by NERC in 2006 [source 2].
WSI       expanded the market for the product to around 20 local authority clients,       achieving sales of &#163;344,000 for this product in 2008, and of &#163;600,000 in       total between 2008 and 2013, generating over &#163;60,000 in royalties for the       University [source 3].
The research findings and the sales achieved by WSI also stimulated wider       interest in the industry, highlighting the potential of this approach and       leading to further impact.
Two other major forecasting providers,       Meteogroup and the UK Met Office, subsequently launched their own products       [sources 4 &amp; 5].
These products were also based on the concept       developed by Chapman and Thornes, but it is believed that they used an       alternative way of calculating the sky-view (which had been the thrust of       the Birmingham patent).
A clear audit trail of the development of rival       products can be discovered in the biannual proceedings of the Standing       International Road Weather Conference [source 6] A series of papers and       presentations can be found by both Meteogroup and UKMO documenting the       development of their systems clearly based on the earlier discoveries made       by the Birmingham academic team.
Meteogroup and the Met Office have been       successful with their new products, although one consequence of this was       that they gained market share from WSI.
Adoption of RBF by road authorities: The adoption of RBF was       initiated by around eight local authorities from 2000 working with ENTICE,       but has now spread much more widely to form part of the approach taken in       the areas of the UK which face the greatest difficulty with winter weather       such as Wales and the Scottish Highlands.
Over the last five years, RBF       has established itself as the premier approach used by winter road       maintenance professionals, with whole sessions now devoted to the topic at       trade conferences [source 7]     One early adopter of RBF was Neath Port Talbot Council, which worked with       ENTICE through the research and development phase and has used the       approach operationally subsequently.
The Council's Project Director,       Network Management (retired) has said:     "The operational benefits of RBF's, initially provided by Entice,         allowed nightly gritting decisions to be made on a route by route basis         rather than mobilising all routes, which would have been the general         case with the traditional forecast.
The ability to visualise how weather         was to develop over individual routes at 1hr intervals over 24hrs has         resulted in improved decision making, achieving significant savings in         plant labour and salt costs."
[source 8]     Following Neath's successful experience, the contract for a RBF service       from WSI was adopted by the South Wales Trunk Road Agency to cover a       larger road network.
The Welsh Assembly Government then took up the idea       and included a requirement for this service as part of the specification       for a principality-wide daily weather forecasting service for unitary       authorities and trunk road agencies that it issued in 2008; the       specification was for a four year contract expected to be worth up to &#163;1m       in total [source 9].
The requirement for RBF was also included in the specification for       Weather Forecasting Services issued by the Highland Council on behalf of       themselves and Scotland TranServ which between them are responsible for       all trunk and non-trunk roads across the Highlands Area.
The service       required included the following:     "The Parties require a route based forecasting service (RBF) delivered         as two lots.
Details of the routes to be included, lengths and segments         are included with the Tender Documentation (Arcview GIS files).
For The         Highland Council the total length of road network for which route based         forecasting is required amounts to approx 2,620km, made up of 97 routes.
For Scotland TranServ the total length of road network for which route         based forecasting is required amounts to approx 1369 km, made up of 24         routes" [source 10].
MeteoGroup presented an analysis in March 2013 of the forecast savings       that the Council could achieve in the variable costs of road treatments by       using a route based approach to prioritise their work; this showed a       &#163;390,000 saving in a single winter (8% of their &#163;4.7m winter budget) from       reducing the amount of salt used and the fuel cost of gritting [source       11].
Further reports of the contribution of RBF from Lincolnshire County       Council were publicised by the Met Office in 2011 [source 5].
International impact: Meteogroup are trialling the approach       extensively in the Netherlands and the Danish Meteorological Institute is       developing their own similar model.
Beneficiaries: The main beneficiaries have been local authorities       who use the new technology to better inform their decision making and       ultimately to make cost savings.
These benefits are passed on to the       public who receive a more efficient service without compromising their       safety.
Reach and significance: The impact of RBF now extends to major       components of the UK road network.
The significance of the approach is in       the operational benefits being achieved by transport authorities who are       better able to optimise the application of their de-icing and related       measures through the application of route-based rather than generalised       weather information.
This is contributing to reducing the costs of winter       weather disruption, estimated in a recent government report as around &#163;1       billion annually, of which half is `hard' cost to the economy, and half is       `welfare' costs to the individual [source 1, Executive Summary para 109],       as well as achieving environmental benefits through reducing salt usage.
The approach also assists highway authorities in achieving their statutory       duty under the Highways Act 1980 to ensure, so far as is reasonably       practicable, that safe passage along a highway is not endangered by snow       or ice.
