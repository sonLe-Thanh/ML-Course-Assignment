     The projects shared findings with three distinct groups of non-academic       beneficiaries:     i) professional artists, arts organisations, performance curators       and producers     ii) archivists/ conservators     iii) the general public.
To reflect the research's practice-based methodologies, which involved       creative-industry       collaborators, dissemination was predominantly achieved through events.
These were mostly open       to the public, although some targeted specific groups, e.g.
training       opportunities for emerging       practitioners, museum/gallery-based archivists.
Collaborators' practice       was directly influenced by       working alongside researchers within projects, while others' practice was       indirectly influenced by       the events.
For the Director of Live Art Development Agency (LADA,       London), the research was       `ambitious and influential.
[...] [It] addressed and advanced many [...]       issues and took the debates       about the relationship between performance and the archive to a new       level.'
Strand one: conservation and accessibility     i) arts professionals/organisations:     P1: Richard Layzell, collaborator on P1's case study around his       1996 NRLA work, I Never Done         Enough Weird Stuff, wrote: `My thinking has changed in relation to       earlier works and especially       seeing them within their own historical context.
[...] As a result I       performed and designed a new       piece called Assisted Power (2010), which engaged directly with       video work from 1980/1.
This was       shown at the 30th Anniversary NRLA and Whitstable Biennale.'
P1/P3: Curating Artistic Research Output (CAiRO) delivered       data-management skills tailored to       the requirements of arts professionals in a four-day summer school (2011),       attended by 23       professional artists, curators and practitioner-researchers, and in an       online postgraduate teaching       resource, with 1,280 visits and 68 module downloads by July 2013, thus       introducing many       professional artists to the value and uses of online archiving.
i/ii) arts professionals/organisations and archivists/conservators:     P1/P3: raised the Live Art Archives' profile and resulted in high       profile new archives being       deposited by artists and organisations, such as Franko B, Greenroom, Hull       Time Based Arts,       Queer Up North, and What's Welsh for Performance?
P3: [5] the `incredible online [NRLA] archive' (artist, Search       Party performance company) was       launched in November 2012.
It already has 682 registered users, including       132 freelance artists,       35 from arts organisations and 26 from museums/galleries.
Feedback has       been entirely positive,       enriching practising artists understanding of live art, with one       contributing artist thanking the team:       `for your work in constructing and safeguarding this special archive [...]       [I]t's brilliant that [the       resource is] interactive and so will continue to be live.'
P2: The curatorial workshop, Conserving and Archiving         Ephemeral Artworks (2008), involved 24       invited participants from significant cultural institutions, e.g.
Bristol       Museum, FACT, the V&amp;A.
Digital Documentation and Performance (2009) comprised three days       of workshops/seminars for       37 researchers, artists, curators, archivists and collection managers.
The       events shared findings       and exchanged best practice for archiving and digitizing [1], with       attendees stating: `On a practical       level, Bristol's approach to the digitization of analogue videotapes fed       into the Library's then-       nascent policy in this area.'
(Lead curator, British Library, Drama and       Literature Recordings).
For       Professor Sarah Whatley (Siobhan Davies Archive), Clarke and Gray's input       was `valuable in our       early stages [...] in the area of digitization formats, curatorial       processes [...] taxonomies for       performance/ephemeral content, data storage methods, metadata [and]       user-generated content.'
ii) archivists/conservators:     P1: In In Time: A Collection of Live Art Case Studies,       published by Live Art UK, Arnolfini Archivist       discussed P1 as a model for their approach to conserving audiovisual       documentation: `As a       commissioning and presenting organisation, Arnolfini is keen to trial PADS       from the beginning of       the research and development of a new piece of Live Art work through to       its presentation.'
Strand two: creative re-use     i) arts professionals/organisations:     P2/P4: For the director of IBT: `Research around live       documentation and performance archives       has been invaluable in informing my professional practice as a curator of       performance.
[Performing       the Archive] has acted as an important catalyst, [...] which has resulted       in the creation of We See         Fireworks, a large-scale memory project [touring] to the US, Europe,       Australia and Brazil to critical       acclaim.
[P2] has created a wealth of inspiration for professionals,       academics and audiences and       the work the department continues to lead in this area resonates across       the world.'
P4: Two one-day symposia and one three-day conference (September       and December 2012, and       April 2013) were held to disseminate the findings around creative       engagement with archives [6],       as well as facilitate knowledge exchange between arts practitioners and       scholars.
Attendance       figures were 76, 89 and 113 respectively, of whom 55 were artists or       practitioner-researchers and       11 were from arts organisations including Theatre Bristol, Cube Cinema       [Bristol], Plymouth Arts       Centre, Live Art Development Agency.
The director of Arnolfini says: `Performing         Documents was       an exemplary research partnership, which culminated in a series of       internationally-significant live       art commissions, a major group exhibition entitled Version Control.
[The] project had a direct       impact in providing an extended period of inquiry into these practices, in       the context of a shared       research culture.
It has enabled the institution to examine its own       assumptions and conventions in       relation to the archive and live art ...[and] led to a continuing strand       of research looking at the       changing relationship of performance and exhibition.'
P2: Jones was invited to share findings [1&amp;5] at Making         Artistic Enquiry Visible, an international       project based in Thompson Rivers University (Canada 2009-11), and in the Intercultural Performance         Project (National University of Singapore 2009), speaking on       archiving performance       and the role practice-as-research can play in developing       academic-creative-industry exchange.
ii) archivists/conservators:     P2/P3/P4: Clarke and Gray's work [1,3,5] fed into       consultancy on Battersea Arts Centre's (&#163;2.5m)       Heritage Lottery Fund project (2012), part of which was devoted to       creating a publicly accessible       digital and physical archive, and into Asia Art Archive's development       (Hong Kong, October 2010).
iii) general public:     P2/P4: Knowledge developed in both projects was applied by Clarke       and Gray in partnership with       theatre company Uninvited Guests, who were commissioned by Tate Britain to       produce The Last         Judgement audiovisual installation [2], as part of the John         Martin: Apocalypse exhibition       (September 2011 - January 2012).
Visited by 150,000 people, `The show       pushes at the       boundaries of conventional gallery experience and will create, we hope,       fresh insights into this       singular figure from art history.'
(Tate curator, Daily Telegraph,       2011.)
i/iii) arts professionals/organisations &amp; general public:     P2: Models for creative re-use of archives [2-4] were       disseminated through a series of public       exhibitions and performances by Clarke with PRS: The Cover of a Book,       at Arnolfini (2008-09)       attracted 16,415 visitors, toured to Leeds Met Gallery and was seen by       45,418 at New Art Gallery,       Walsall (2011).
Cover-ed (Arnolfini, 2011) remade Ed Ruscha's 1969       photo novel Crackers,       selected from the archive, as Salad Dressing, a new bookwork,       installation and event, attended by       7,543 people.
Salad Dressing was included in Ed Ruscha Books         &amp; Co at New York's Gagosian       Gallery (2013).
Commissioned for The Pigs of Today are the Hams of         Tomorrow, curated by       Plymouth Arts Centre and Marina Abramovic (2010) with Clarke as curatorial       advisor, Untitled         Performance Stills enabled public participants, scholars, curators       and artists to remake moments       from past performances to camera, with photographer Hugo Glendinning.
P2/P4: Memory of Theatre, Clarke's Heritage Sandbox       project for Bristol's Knowledge Exchange       Hub for the Creative Economy (REACT), was a collaboration with the       artistic director of BOVT,       producers MAYK (Mayfest), Pyxis Design and mobile software company       Calvium.
A new archive       was created of audiences' memories of theatre and made publicly accessible       in situ.
The software       innovations made it possible for Calvium to `offer this solution to other       customers interested in an       indoor location-aware app.'
MAYK director wrote: `We are excited by the       potential of the project to       transfer to other heritage contexts and developing the business model for       how this might happen.'
P1-P4: Presentations disseminated findings [1-5] to       wide-ranging audiences of arts professionals,       archivists and researchers: Jones at NRLA (Glasgow 2009), the Digital         Echoes symposium on       online archives (2013), attended by organizations including V&amp;A and       BBC; and Clarke       `Remembering Performance' (NRLA 2010), re.act.feminism, Berlin       (2009), Archiv/Praxis,       Tanzarchiv Leipzig (2009), School of the Art Institute Chicago (2009).
P4: Clarke worked with collaborators from PRS on Group Show,       and Jones with Bodies in Flight       on Do The Wild Thing!
Redux, producing performances and an       installation (Arnolfini 2012) inspired       by archival documents [6].
These were conducted in dialogue with       professional artists from Every       House has a Door and Blast Theory, who produced their own new works, 9         Beginnings (two       performances) and Jog Shuttler (installation), which 3,463 people       saw.
Arnolfini's curator of       performance wrote: `The project successfully brought unique debate,       discourse and performance       commissions to Arnolfini that would not have happened otherwise, bringing       many stimulating ideas       to the table that will go on to resonate with the artistic and curatorial       performance community.'
