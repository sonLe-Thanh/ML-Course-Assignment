Conservation of unique fossil site     In 2005, in collaboration with Prof Hou, Siveter and Aldridge (and Derek       Siveter from Oxford) were       the only academics from outside China asked to help the Yuri Municipal       Government &#8212; the       administrative region within which Chengjiang is located &#8212; to prepare an       application for World       Heritage Status.
From 2008, they worked first on a report from Yuxi to       Beijing to secure the site as       one of China's official nominations and then on the report to UNESCO which       outlined the case for       the Chengjiang site [A].
World Heritage Site (WHS) status was       granted in July 2012 [B], following       three years of nomination development in which the Unit's research played       a key role.
The academics' contribution to this three-year process was extensive;       they wrote all the scientific       parts of the bid, including details of the global scientific significance       of the Chengjiang site, and       how it differs from other palaeontological WHS &#8212; both of crucial       importance in establishing why       Chengjiang is deserving of WHS status.
Their contribution drew on more       than 20 years of research       conducted at Leicester which revealed the significance of the fossils (see       A sections 2 and 3).
The       first overview of the full diversity of the fossil biota was central to       demonstrating that the fossils       present are equal if not greater in diversity and quality of preservation       than other sites of       exceptional preservation already recognized as WHS.
Any country is eligible to send to UNESCO a list of nominees for World       Heritage Status.
The       UNESCO World Heritage Committee, elected by nation states, meets every       year to choose the       successful nominations &#8212; those natural or man-made wonders, which are       judged to be in the       greatest need of protection.
This decision is informed by a report from       the International Union for       Conservation of Nature, which assesses the respective strengths of each       nomination in       accordance with the set criteria.
In addition to underpinning the Chinese Government's WHS nomination, the       IUCN report itself is       also informed directly by Leicester research &#8212; the seminal book The         Cambrian fossils of         Chengjiang, China: the flowering of early animal life (of which       Siveter and Aldridge were leading       authors) is cited as "additional literature consulted''[C].
The bid       also cites numerous papers by       Leicester authors in the bibliography [A].
There are significant benefits that come with World Heritage Site status,       not least its established       influence in world tourism markets, and China itself is benefitting both       financially and socially       following the success of the application.
Economic impacts include       increased access to       preservation funds and world heritage tourism; societal impacts include       significantly increased       public interest and awareness [D].
On a wider scale, the status       impacts on all of mankind's cultural       heritage through preservation of a unique physical environment which has       revealed &#8212; and       continues to reveal &#8212; important new information about the roots of our       collective natural history.
As part of the application, Chengjiang county and Yuxi municipality       pledged an annual allocation of       at least 6.5 million Chinese yuan (approx.
&#163;650,000) to the stable       management fund for       Chengjiang Fossil Site.
This funds onsite patrols, monitoring activities,       specimen sorting and       cataloguing of fossils from the museum, museum maintenance, staff       stipends, promotion and       publicity, fossil excavation and research, community training and       external/International exchange       and cooperation.
The site's nomination for WHS Status had led to increased funding support       from Yunnan provincial       and the Central government for maintenance of the site [E, section       3.2]       Data for visitor numbers for 2012 and 2013 are not available, but Official       projections are for visitor       numbers rising to 30-40,000 as a direct result of WHS Status.
Much remedial work to redress the effects of mining activity had already       been undertaken in the       area, and additional work on ecological restoration and forest/grass       reclamation of the site is       ongoing and will continue as a result of the successful application for       WHS status.
Importantly, as       a result of the WHS nomination, additional protocols [E, section       5.3.2], were added to the Chinese       legislative system surrounding infrastructure development at the       Chengjiang site.
The report       states: "Compared to the past practices, the infrastructure development       projects must go through       dual review and approval, implying more strict review and approval       protocols."
This, in effect, will       prevent any infrastructure development at the site in future as the       management institutions of       Chengjiang Fossil Site and the local government now have a veto.
[E,       section 5.32]     B. Fostering interest in science     The Unit's research on exceptionally preserved fossils, combining big       questions about evolutionary       origins with an experimental approach, serves as a highly effective       vehicle for raising awareness       about the evolution of life, the history of biodiversity, and the       importance of `blue skies' research.
As well as widespread international, national and local media coverage,       this has been achieved       through direct contact with school-children, the public and policy makers       at a range of events.
With funding from the University, The Palaeontological Association, and       The Natural Environment       Research Council we designed activities and successfully bid for selection       at the following events.
SET for Britain 2011 (Houses of Parliament): direct interaction         between policy makers and         Britain's early-career research scientists who are driving progress in         and development of UK         research and R&amp;D. An email received after the event from Richard         Fuller (MP for Bedford and         Kempston), says "I do take on board your comments re: funding of science         &#8212; particularly         fundamental research'' [G].
The Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition 2011: 13,800 visitors, 32%         of whom were school         students; visitor questionnaires conducted over several years indicate         that 60-70% of students         are more interested in a career in science after visiting the exhibition         [F].
The Royal Society event         also includes invitation only evening soirees, allowing researchers to         interact and engage directly         with MPs and policy makers', we took this opportunity to emphasize the         excitement and value of         `blue skies' research (we spent 15 minutes with the Minister for Science         David Willetts, for         example).
Big Bang 2012 and Big Bang 2013 (UK Young Scientists and Engineers         Fair): designed to raise         awareness and dispel myths about STEM and careers within STEM.
More than         115,000 young         people, their teachers and parents attended [H] and         questionnaires reveal similar levels of         increase in the numbers of students interested in careers in science as         with the Royal Society,         and an increase in the likelihood of parents and teachers recommending         scientific careers to         children of around 60%.
Around 80% of teachers indicate that they will         incorporate learnings from         the event into their teaching.
