     The brain interprets complex visual stimuli extremely rapidly; viewers       usually interpret a scene within 1/20th of a second, but have       little knowledge of the process that leads to their understanding of what       they are seeing.
By separating information into distinct SF bandwidths,       the hybrid image instantly challenges and broadens a viewer's       understanding of what they see and how they interpret it.
Hybrid image       technology1, developed exclusively by University of Glasgow       researchers allows the creation of `optical illusions' that illustrate the       interaction between visual information we receive from the outside world       and the brain's perception of that information, which dictates our       reaction to what we see.
The hybrid image technology allows a       multi-layered, complex process to be demonstrated quickly and easily,       lending itself to `popular science' media such as museums, magazines and       the internet.
Hybrid image technology has been widely used in commercial, cultural and       educational contexts; representative examples are given below to       demonstrate the ubiquity of the image.
Marilyn Einstein and Ghostly Gaze: creative impact     Optical illusions produced through hybrid image technology have been       disseminated worldwide.
The most widely recognised example is the Marilyn         Einstein optical illusiona (created by Aude Oliva at MIT       using the University of Glasgow technology; shown on the left).
At       different distances, a viewer will perceive either Marilyn Monroe or       Albert Einstein.
For example, when viewing the image close up (as in the       left hand image) a viewer will see Albert Einstein whilst viewing the same       image from a distance a viewer will see Marilyn Monroe (as in the right       hand image).
In July 2013, a search for `Marilyn Einstein' using Google       returned over 6 million entries.
The popular Ghostly Gaze hybrid image       (created by University of Glasgow researcher Rob Jenkins) won second prize       in the 2008         Visual Illusion of the Year Awardsb (Vision Sciences,       Naples, Florida).
In 2010, media coverage of these two optical illusions inspired the       architect Michel Mossessian to design the exterior of his iconic building,       5 Merchant Square, in Paddington, London.c In an article in The       Independent d, Mossessian was described as `tak[ing]         architectural perception into entirely new zones'.
Mossessian used       an adaptation of the hybrid image technology to achieve his design.
From a       distance, the building presents an image of cloud formations; up close, it       appears shielded from external eyes by drawn curtains.
Mossessian called       it `pure perception &#8212; a new architectural canvas' and says, `I wondered         how you could give interesting depth to a flat glass fa&#231;ade, a         perception that suggested distance, and focus, but with a seamless         transition between what you saw from a distance, or from closer.
'j     `Far away, a beauty': commercial impact     Hybrid image technology has been widely used for commercial purposes by       multinational and UK companies, and is freely available via the University       of Glasgow Easy-Access IP scheme.
Ads designed         by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi for Mercedes-Benz used the Marilyn Einstein       hybrid image to help sell the Viano car model in 2010 with the tag line `Far         away, a beauty.
Close up, sheer intelligence.
'e     The hybrid image is also used by online IT forums and opticians (GlassesDirect.co.uk,       HomeOpticians.co.uk       and JustEyewear.comf,g)       as an initial eye test because the separation of SF bands is an easy       indicator of possible vision problems.
Software manufacturer Adobe refers       customers to an online training library of courses for sale, including one         on the creation of dual-image optical illusions (which features       Marilyn Einstein).h Current industrial interest involves the       application of the hybrid image technology in the development of       innovative large-scale display technologies that will form large viewing       environments for use in open public spaces such as airports.i     Textbooks and Exhibitions: educational impact     Hybrid image optical illusions have been the basis for numerous science       and popular exhibitions on vision and perception.
Marilyn Einstein has       been included in the permanent exhibits of the San Francisco Exploratorium       since 2003 (550,000 annual visitors)j and in the Glasgow       Science Centre since 2006 (since April 2011 as part of its Mindworks       exhibit; 513,000 annual visitors).k The image has also been       used at the Exploratorium to explain the process behind vision and       perception of images through a series of annual Continuous Professional       Development workshops for secondary school science teachers in California       (the Exploratorium Teacher Institute's High School Science Summer       Institutel), and in an online         resource for science teachers alongside the original hybrid images       shown in Fig.
1C,D.
Hybrid images have also been featured on educational       and entertainment television programs, such as The         One Show (BBC1, October 2009).m     Within the formal education sector, hybrid images have been featured in       numerous textbooks in the USA and UK,n including the 2010       textbook, Face Processing: Psychological, Neuropsychological, and         Applied Perspectives, published by Oxford University Press and       authored by Graham Hole and Victoria Bourne (University of Sussex).
In the       USA, hybrid images and the relevant research findings are carried in the       most recent edition of Sensation and Perception (Goldstein, 9th       edition, 2013).
The hybrid image has also been featured on the covers of Scientific         American (in 2010 and 2011), and in the Scientific American Mind       anthology of the best visual illusions (13 September 2011).o
