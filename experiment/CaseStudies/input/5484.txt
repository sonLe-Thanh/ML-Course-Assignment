     Process from research to impact     Research at the University of Strathclyde that identified the barriers       and enablers to re-professionalisation of refugee teachers was       disseminated widely through a number of processes: via the Scottish       Insight Institute international programme on Refugee Integration (2009);       dissemination in Canada and Australia (2010); a DVD circulated to all       schools in Scotland; ESRC seminar series Diverse Teachers for Diverse       Learners (2011-12); Nordforsk research network Diverse Teachers for       Diverse Learners (from 2011, with Geri Smyth as UK leader).
The research       was also disseminated to policy-makers and stakeholders through a       published report that was made widely available online, through       peer-reviewed journal papers, and through articles in the media and in       professional journals.
On receipt of funding from the European Refugee Fund, the first task was       to design and develop a database of refugee teachers in Scotland.
This       database now holds details of nearly 400 refugee teachers in Scotland,       with data related to demographic and professional details.
The database       design was then adopted by the Refugees Into Teaching group (RIT) funded       by the Teacher Development Agency in England.
The database was seen as       such an important way of capturing this detail that RIT sought training       from Strathclyde staff to develop a similar database.
The project also       shared data with the Scottish Refugee Council and the Bridges Projects in       order to maximise available support services for refugee professionals in       Scotland.
The Scottish Government funded scoping study on Support         Mechanisms for the Recognition of the Skills, Learning and         Qualifications of Migrant Workers and Refugees led by the Scottish       Credit and Qualifications Partnership [Source A] concluded by providing       three options for the Scottish Government to develop a service to support       the recognition of skills and qualifications of refugees and migrants in       Scotland.
The study found that: "specific [...] expertise exists         within the HEI sector, as a result of past-projects and activity,         including the RITeS project" and the evidential experience of RITeS       was considered in the development of the final options.
Types of Impact     Improved support and training for refugee teaching staff:     An integral part of the RITeS project was the provision of tailored       support for the refugee teachers no matter their immigration status or       teaching background.
The need to clearly identify these needs in a       detailed fashion was quickly spotted as a research opportunity and funding       was received from the West Access Forum to pursue this.
The resulting       interviews and observational field notes resulted in a rich body of data       which were disseminated via RITeS Management forum meetings and public       events.
This data shaped subsequent programme provision and was       disseminated to local authorities to assist in their planning of       Continuing Professional Development for teachers.
A statement from Glasgow       City Council (GCC) indicates: "As a result of the research undertaken         identifying refugee teachers, a large number of RITES teachers had work         shadowing placements in GCC schools.
This had a number of benefits: For         RITES teachers &#8212; an opportunity to use their skills in Glasgow schools,         to observe classroom practice and learning experiences, to understand         differences between education in Glasgow and their own experiences.
For         host schools &#8212; many of these placements were very successful.
Schools         gained an enhanced understanding of the needs of refugee teachers and of         refugee issues in general.
The teachers were often able to use their         language skills to support children with English as an Additional         language and to help with promoting first languages in the school.
For         children &#8212; for many refugee children, it was an opportunity to see         someone from their background in a position of importance in the school"       [Source B].
Accreditation and Union membership for refugee teachers:     The data was also able to guide the General Teaching Council for Scotland       (GTCS) as they considered the accreditation needs of internationally       educated teachers and future employers regarding the employment support       needs of such teachers.
The GTCS subsequently gave priority status to the       challenges and opportunities facing refugee teachers in Scottish schools       as a focus for teacher research to be supported by the Council.
This       enabled refugee teachers to participate in GTCS funded research.
The research findings demonstrated the significance of financial hardship       as a barrier to re-entry to the profession.
The Head of Registration at       the GTCS wrote: "One area the research discovered that was problematic         for RiTES applicants was the financial implication of applying for and         being awarded registration.
The GTCS decided that we would waive the         initial registration fee of &#163;60 which eased the burden" [Source C].
The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS: the main trade union       representing teachers in Scotland) waived membership fees for all those on       the database whether teaching in Scotland or not.
This gave teachers       access to professional fora essential for their continuing relationship       with the profession.
A letter from the National Officer, Education and       Equality, EIS, states "it is the view of the EIS that the research         undertaken through the RITeS project has directly and indirectly         benefited refugee and asylum seeking teachers.
--- It was         decided to alter our constitution and create a new category of         membership of our trade union for refugee and asylum seeking teachers &#8212; an associate membership, free for refugee and asylum seeking teachers         until they gained employment" [Source D].
Additionally the Scottish Government recognised the need to work       alongside the RITeS project to assist in the Race Equality Scheme Action       Plan [Source E].
The data helped to inform local authorities and the       General Teaching Council for Scotland of the specific needs of refugee and       ethnic minority teachers.
The importance of enabling the development of       professional capital in the new country was recognised in planning support       for such teachers.
In addition to the EIS waiving membership fees, local       authorities provided staff free of charge to deliver CPD to the group and       the GTCS paid initial registration fees for the refugee teachers.
Increased official debate and public awareness of problems faced by         asylum seekers:     The recognition of the personal and institutional racism faced by many of       the refugee teachers led to local authority provision of training for       their staff to help them consider better the future needs of the group.
A       statement from the Head of Policy, Scottish Refugee Council indicated "Findings         from the RITeS research concerning the skills atrophy of professionals         in the asylum process in Scotland continues to play an important element         in our campaigning and lobbying discourse around the right to work for         people seeking asylum.
We are pleased that there is strong cross-party         support for this measure in Scotland and for the benefits that people         seeking asylum could bring to the workforce, society and economy,         evidenced recently in a debate in the Scottish Parliament" [Source       F].
Improved language training opportunities: The research findings       indicated the barrier represented by limited knowledge of classroom       English and this influenced the development of specific English Language       for teaching classes at Anniesland College.
The Principal of the college       [Source G] wrote "Policy at the highest level of government was         affected by the RITeS project: education was enhanced and learning for         refugees was goal ordinated.
Longer term it also had an impact on the         qualifications that were developed at a national level."
Exact numbers of refugee teachers subsequently employed cannot be given       as refugee status is not collected and nor does it need to be declared by       employers.
However, the number of ethnic minority teachers registered with       the GTCS increased significantly through the support offered by the       project partners which resulted from the dissemination of the research       findings.
