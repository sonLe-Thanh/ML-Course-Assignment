The initial work from Imperial was expanded by RespiVert       from 2007-2010 which resulted in the identification of a completely new       class of treatments for severe lung diseases called Narrow Spectrum Kinase       (NSKI) inhibitors.
RespiVert provided over 10 posts for highly skilled       scientists during this time.
Acquisition of RespiVert by Johnson &amp; Johnson     In June 2010, RespiVert was acquired by Centocor Ortho Biotech (now       Janssen Biotech), a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson for       approximately $110 million.
Imperial Innovations held 13.4% of RespiVert       and the return of &#163;9.5 million gross cash represented a 4.7x return on its       three-year investment.
After revenue-sharing payments of &#163;0.2 million to       Imperial, the disposal generated a profit of &#163;7.2 million [1].
RespiVert has developed a number of Narrow Spectrum Kinase (NSKI) and PI3       kinase (PI3K) &#947;&#948; inhibitors as first in class new treatments for       COPD and severe asthma using inhaled delivery.
The lead compound RV568 has       been tested in four clinical studies and early evidence in a COPD       biomarker study has delivered extremely promising data [2].
RV568 has now       entered a Phase II multinational clinical trial for COPD.
RespiVert filed       several patents for compounds in its NSKI programme that describe newly       identified modes of action for the treatment of COPD and steroid intensive       inflammation during 2010-2012 [3-4].
RespiVert have also developed PI3 kinase compounds which are a new set of       &#947;/&#948; isoform inhibitors for inhaled delivery that were derived from       research on theophylline and PI3&#948; carried out by Professor Barnes and       Dr Ito at Imperial [5].
This has led to the development of RV1729, a       unique, first in class, inhaled dual isoform inhibitor that offers       distinct options for the treatment of steroid refractory asthma and COPD.
This compound has undergone single and multiple dose Phase I testing in       normal volunteers in 2013 and has now entered Phase II testing in severe       asthma and COPD patients.
The NSKI inhibitors developed by RespiVert have now been licenced to       another start-up company, TopiVert in 2012 by Drs Rapeport and Ito, with a       successful funding round of &#163;8 million to develop topical medicines for       inflammatory diseases of the eye and gut [6].
