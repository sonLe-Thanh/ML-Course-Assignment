     Impact on health     The National Eczema Society (NES) charity, which supports people with       eczema, highlights the substantial improvements to eczema patient       wellbeing that have resulted from our work [S1, S2].
Recommendations by NICE agreed with the conclusions that Aqueous Cream BP       should never be used as a leave-on emollient; the NICE guidance on atopic       eczema in children [S3] cited this research.
This advice has been       further reinforced in the NICE Quality Standard for atopic eczema issued       in 2013 [S4], which is based on the NICE atopic eczema guideline of       2007.
Our Aqueous Cream research has also been recognised and acted upon by       medicine regulators internationally.
The New Zealand Medicines Safety       Authority quoted R5 stating.
"These papers highlight the importance of         not using products containing SLS, such as Aqueous Cream, as leave-on         emollients as they may act to exacerbate skin damage, rather than         support skin barrier function" [S5].
Other regulators       including the Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)       have issued advice regarding the adverse effects of Aqueous Cream [S6].
Commercial impact     As a result of these research-led changes, the costs of healthcare have       changed in practice.
The NES has followed our research using it in their       campaign to remove cheap, ineffective, harmful emollients, such as Aqueous       Cream, from formularies.
"These products not only exacerbate diseases         such as atopic eczema but may even contribute to its development.
They         are also a false economy because Aqueous cream often makes atopic eczema         worse leading to referral to dermatologists" [S1, S2].
The       sales of Aqueous Cream have fallen 70% since 2009 [S1].
All of the UK companies previously producing emollients containing SLS       have now removed the SLS and replaced it with a less harmful emulsifier.
NES sources state that: "The logo `SLS Free' now appears on all of         these emollients &#8212; a direct consequence of your research.
Similar         reformulations of emollient products are taking place internationally"       [S1, S2].
As a result of our research, companies producing skin-healthcare products       have invested in research and development, working with us to design and       test new and improved formulations that are now in production.
We have       spent the past 15 years developing completely new products to produce an       optimal repair of the defective skin barrier in atopic dermatitis,       initially through a spinout company (Molecular Skin Care), but more       recently with a [text removed for publication] investment by [text removed       for publication] [S7].
We have performed randomised control       clinical studies demonstrating the benefits of the new formulation       compared with existing formulations.
This product is now going into       production [S1, S2].
We have also been working with other pharmaceutical companies to develop       optimal wash products, for use in regimens to prevent the development of       atopic eczema.
We have worked with Johnson &amp; Johnson to develop and       test an optimally formulated SLS-free range of baby care products       (including `Top to Toe' baby wash).
Johnson and Johnson funded a knowledge       exchange scheme (&#163;718,000) with the University of Sheffield to exploit       biochemical and biophysical assays of skin barrier function developed by       the group [S8].
With our collaborators (Professor Dame Tina       Lavender's group in Manchester) and Johnson and Johnson in the USA we have       conducted a programme of clinical trials to evaluate all of the products       that we put on babies' skin [S9, S10].
Since 2008, Johnson and       Johnson have invested many &#163;millions in research and development of these       products and have seen sales of their products `Top-To-Toe Bath' increase       by 15% and `Extra Sensitive Wipes' increase by 8% [S8].
The key       enabler in these sales increases was verification of the findings from the       clinical trials that these products were safe to use from birth.
Public understanding has improved.
Educating children with atopic       eczema and their parents regarding the importance of avoiding all harsh       soaps and detergents, and how to use the correct emollient products, was       evaluated in our 2003 audit [R6].
This paper was cited by both NICE       2007 and NICE 2013 as evidence for the crucial role of education in the       treatment of atopic eczema [S3, S4].
Regarding our work NES states       that: "Education regarding the use of topical treatments is one of the         interventions that has transformed the lives of children and adults with         atopic eczema.
The Sheffield team, led by Professor Michael Cork, have         made a major contribution in this area" [S1, S2].
