     i1) Informed by historical and practice-led research, Britain's most         iconic literary figure is reinterpreted for a wide public by one of         Britain's most f&#234;ted living poets.
While Shakespeare's plays have continually been interpreted and renewed       for non-specialist audiences through adaptation for film and other media,       the Sonnets represent a major aspect of the Shakespearean canon that, to       date, had not much benefitted from the popular appeal that adaptation into       new media can bring.
The singularity of the Sonnets within Shakespeare's       oeuvre then, is partly due to their remoteness to modern audiences       otherwise at ease with Shakespeare.
Don Paterson's Reading         Shakespeare's Sonnets, based partly on his practice-led research as       a sonneteer, and informed by Rhodes' research, made a major contribution       to public debate about, and understanding of, Shakespeare's sonnets, as       evidenced in the numerous reviews it generated in the non-academic print       press, and in online media and blogs: `a masterclass for the lay reader'       (The Times); `one of the finest living poets brings to this a         craftsman's insight' (The Independent); `combines highly         sensitive attention to detail... with due awareness of historical         context' (The Financial Times); `deep knowledge shared at         speed' (The Daily Telegraph); `literary criticism was         never so amusing' (Lizzy's Literary Life); `a critical milestone'       (Clive James); a restoration job on a masterpiece' (The Sunday         Herald, which also mentions Rhodes's scholarship as having `done       much' to rid modern academia of its `jargon-ridden lingo').
[S6]     Print sales of Reading Shakespeare's Sonnets stood at just over       8,500 at the end of the census date.
[S1] Retailing at &#163;17.99 (Hb) and       &#163;12.99 (Pb), Reading Shakespeare's Sonnets also therefore made a       significant economic contribution to Faber's poetry list (most poetry       titles do not sell more than around 1,500 copies).
See (i3) below for its       digital distribution.
Paterson further promoted the reach and impact of       the research by conducting a series of high-profile, public-facing talks       on the Sonnets that included: a reading and talk at the Cheltenham Book       Festival 09/10/2010; a discussion at the British Library with Ben Crystal,       Eric Rasmussen and Jonathan Bate, 02/02/2011; a reading at Cambridge       Wordfest 16/04/2011 [S1]; at Hay Book Festival 29/05/2011; a talk, `For       the Love of Shakespeare', at Edinburgh Book Festival 23/08/2011; and at       Durham Book Festival 22/10/2011.
The Festival Director of Cambridge       Wordfest reported: `audience feedback was excellent.
Don Paterson's         ability to make the complexities of Shakespeare intelligible to a mixed         audience provided a crucial cultural contribution to the festival'.
[S2] Paterson also wrote a general         article on the Sonnets for The Guardian on 16/10/2010,       generating over 120 comments in which his arguments are debated       passionately by members of the public.
[S7]     i2) Literary heritage is presented to a wide audience via a UK-wide         charitable trust dedicated to promoting literature among non-traditional         readers.
Public interest in Shakespeare is stimulated.
As a result of the expertise displayed in Reading Shakespeare's         Sonnets, and as a further mark of its impact, Paterson, `as a         renowned expert', was invited by the charitable trust World         Book Night to be the consultant editor for a selection of 25       Shakespeare Sonnets to coincide with Shakespeare's birthday on 23/04/2012.
[S3] The mission statement of World Book Night (WBN) is `To raise the       profile of reading through a mass engagement project which works at a       grass roots level to inspire those who don02bct regularly read to do so.'
(What We Do).
As part of WBN's collaboration with Paterson, a total of 2.5 million       copies of 25 different books from authors as diverse as Jane Austen and       Bill Bryson were given away, each with sonnet on the inside back cover, chosen         by Paterson to complement the title.
[S8]     According to the WBN 2012 Evaluation         Report: almost 2000 libraries and over 500 bookshops participated;       with the support of a valuable BBC partnership more than a million people       visited the WBN website and millions more were reached via social media.
[S9] Of the 2.5 million books distributed, 625,000 were given away by       individual volunteers, the rest in association with third-party       organisations.
The Chief Executive of World Book Night reported that as a       result of Paterson's involvement `we were able to ensure a Shakespeare         poem reached 625,000 people who don't regularly read'.
[S3] 54% of       WBN's volunteer givers distributed some of their books to youth; 30% to       adult learners; 18% to hospital/care staff; 13% to patients; 8% to prison       inmates.
In addition to books distributed by volunteer givers, WBN       committed a further 520,000 copies directly to engage with the hardest to       reach givers in prisons, hospitals, care homes, social, sheltered, and       supported housing and through a range of charitable partners.
Working with       partner organisations 111 prisons and young offender institutes (75% of UK       prisons) received more than 40,000 books.
[S9] As a result of this mass       distribution of a variety of both classic and contemporary literary       titles, new and diverse audiences were also found for Shakespeare's       Sonnets.
It is worth noting that according to Google, the highest spike in       internet searches for `Shakespeare's Sonnets' since February 2010 occurred       in April 2012 (and more than is usually the case around Shakespeare's       birthday).
[S10] While correlation does not always indicate cause, it       seems plausible that Paterson's activities with WBN prompted public       interest in searches to do with Shakespeare's Sonnets.
As a result of this initiative, Paterson was invited onto Radio         4's Front Row (monthly download figures of over 230,000 in addition       to Radio 4's live audience of c. 849,000 listeners weekly) on 23/04/2012       (at 19.59 minutes) to discuss the Sonnets and his selection for World Book       Night, further stimulating public awareness and understanding of them.
Paterson also appeared in The           Guardian (print circulation c. 200,000) on 20/04/2012,       discussing his project in advance of WBN.
i3) Innovation and entrepreneurial activity is supported by         contribution to development of a new product in the digital publishing         industry.
Simultaneously, contribution is made to the economic         prosperity of that industry, and Shakespeare is reinterpreted for new         audiences.
Paterson's work in Reading Shakespeare's Sonnets also directly       led to his being invited to work as principal consultant and contributor       to Faber/Touch Press's Shakespeare's Sonnets iPad App, launched in April       2012.
This App features a lightly re-written version of all of Paterson's       commentary, as well as him reading several sonnets.
In this way Paterson       was instrumental in translating four hundred year-old poetry from the age       of print into a new digital medium, helping to create an innovative new       software product and to consolidate the entrepreneurial activity of a       relatively new start-up business at the same time.
(Touch Press had only       released one App before Shakespeare's Sonnets.)
According to the Head of Faber Digital the development budget of the App       was [text removed for publication] and Paterson's role as `literary       advisor' was integral to that development process: `Don was central to         the creation of an app that is at once academically rigorous and         immediately appealing to a wide and general audience.
Many of the         reviews of the app specifically recognise the value of Don's         contribution.'
[S4] Faber's digital project manager also       acknowledged in The Independent that Paterson's commentary was       central to the App's successful design: `the notes matter as much as         the stellar reciters... We've given them a lot of love and attention.
They really do behave in a joined up way.'
[S11] The Sonnets App       retails at &#163;9.99 and according to the Senior Producer and Editor at Touch       Press, was downloaded [text removed for publication] times in the period       to 31 July 2013.
[S5] Fifteen months after the App's launch, therefore,       Touch Press had not only recovered their development costs, but generated       a revenue of over &#163;20,000: a significant sum for a small and relatively       young independent business.
That `[text removed for publication] of         these downloads were specifically via the Education Volume Discount         program' [S5], further indicates that the App is beginning to have       some educational application.
This new digital version of the Sonnets also prompted media and       blogosphere discussion of the Sonnets: it was positively reviewed as `magnificent'       by U.S. current affairs site Salon       on 24/07/2012 [S12]; tweeted by David         Tennant on 28/06/2012; mentioned with reference to Paterson's       commentary on BBC One's Andrew         Marr Show on 08/07/2012 as evidence of the `relevance of Shakespeare       to the 21st Century'; reviewed in The           Guardian on 08/07/2012 (`Paterson's commentary is the best         thing about this app'); reviewed in The           Independent on 17/07/2012 (`a digital delight') [S11];       and shortlisted for the FutureBook Innovation Awards.
