     The impact achieved from these research findings has been through       significantly influencing the policies and priorities of the world's most       active space agencies in terms of the scientific objectives of their space       exploration programmes, in mission design and on the instrumentation       carried on spacecraft.
Leading individuals at the European and US agencies       (ESA and NASA) have confirmed that Smith and Sims' findings on       low-temperature gas-phase chemistry and kinetics have made a material       contribution to their understanding of interstellar chemistry and thus       helped determine the approach to current and planned exploratory missions.
The impact extends into the decision-making and practice of the world's       foremost space agencies.
It has influenced how these agencies       conceptualise their missions, deploy very large sums of public money and       plan their future programmes.
Given the length of time involved in       planning and executing space missions, any significant impact is likely to       be visible across a longer period than a five year window; nevertheless,       it can been seen here that although these impacts started prior to 2008,       they have continued to be important to the current Rosetta mission, as       well as on the Herschel mission which launched in 2009 and to ongoing work       in the development phase of further planetary exploration.
Impact on Missions Probing the Interstellar Medium     Our Sun was formed from the condensation of an interstellar cloud,       complete with all the complex molecules that it contained, about 4.5       billion years ago.
The proto-solar nebula then evolved into the Solar       System.
Exploration of the Solar System and the understanding of Earth's       place in it, including its evolution and biosphere, are fundamental       rationales for ESA and NASA.
Such exploration is extremely expensive &#8212; a       typical interplanetary mission can cost 1bn Euro &#8212; and is only undertaken       with a thorough analysis of the mission's scientific objectives and       feasibility.
Indeed the planning, design and development stages typically       span a decade or more prior to the actual operational phase.
Knowledge of the types of complex molecules formed within interstellar       clouds serves as an important starting point in the search for organics       and ultimately life elsewhere in the Solar System.
ESA's infrared       astrophysics missions [ISO (1995-1998) and Herschel (2009 - 2013)]       together with NASA's Spitzer mission (2003-2012) were the pathfinders for       establishing the detailed organic component of the interstellar medium,       with their observations informed by the published research conducted at       UoB into reaction rates at low temperatures.
Professor R. E. Griffiths,       the Program Scientist for Physics of the Cosmos at NASA has stated: "This         work, exemplified by that performed by Smith and Sims, is seminal to our         understanding of the low-temperature reactions which lead to the         production of complex molecules within interstellar clouds, molecules         which are evidenced by observations made using instruments on space         telescopes".
[source 1]     A Rosetta Mission Project Scientist, Rita Schulz (see below) also       confirmed that the Herschel Space Observatory, launched in 2009, has the       study of the low temperature chemistry of complex organics in molecular       clouds as a key objective, and that this is a further example of a mission       where benefits will rely on this research.
Impact on Comet Missions: ESA's Rosetta mission     Having knowledge of the composition of interstellar clouds allows       designers of Solar System exploration missions to include instrumentation       that can search for these various species on or in planetary and smaller       bodies (asteroids, comets, moons).
It is here that the published work of       Smith/Sims has had the most impact, affecting instrument design,       spacecraft operations and instrument configurations during the exploration       phase.
Building on the results from ESA's GIOTTO mission, the Rosetta       mission to rendezvous and land on a comet in 2014 has the study of these       complex organics as a key objective.
The Rosetta spacecraft will be the first to undertake the long-term       exploration of a comet at close quarters and also the first mission to       land on a comet.
The craft comprises a large orbiter, which is designed to       operate for a decade at large distances from the Sun, and a small lander.
The craft carries a total of 21 instruments (11 in the Orbiter, 10 on the       Lander) designed to complete the most detailed study of a comet ever       attempted.
[source 2] Three of these instruments carry out activities that       draw significantly on the work at Birmingham.
[text removed for publication] the Rosetta Mission Project Scientist       confirmed the contribution of the Birmingham research to the Rosetta       mission as follows: "Three mass spectrometers, two on the Lander (COSAC         and PTOEMY) and one on the Orbiter {COSIMA), are designed to study         in-situ the composition of comet refractories specifically focussing on         organic macromolecules.
They will measure molecular numbers of CHON         particles from which certain chemical groups may be identified.
However,         to be able to conclude on a specific derivate or clearly attribute the         results to specific organic molecules, laboratory measurements are         required that allow to determine th probability of their synthesis in a         low temperature environment.
Important work was done at Birmingham University's School of Chemical         Sciences on low-temperature gas-phase chemistry and kinetics.
Many of         the ion-neutral and neutral-neutral processes studied and reaction rates         determined by Smith, Sims and Rowe have been particularly helpful in         view to understanding interstellar chemistry and its relations to         volatiles in comets.
I believe that without the research work from         Birmingham University over the past some twenty years we would have a         poorer Rosetta mission &#8212; particularly as much of it was conducted during         the mission's critical design and build phase in the 90's.
Furthermore         on arrival at our target comet the past efforts of the School of         Chemical Sciences related to low temperature reaction rates will be         invaluable in interpreting the chemistry that will be underway as our         comet makes its way ever closer to our sun."
[source 3]     Impact on Planetary Missions: Mars and the Jovian moons     Comets are one end of the exploration spectrum.
Planetary bodies,       particularly Mars and the moons of Jupiter such as Europa and Ganymede,       are the other and have recently become centre of attention.
Current and       planned missions to Mars by NASA, ESA and the Russian Space Agency RKA       have the search for life, extinct or extant, as a key aim, with complex       organic molecules now a precursor in that search.
The same can be said of       the study of the Jovian moons, a mini solar-system in its own right.
Mission designers, instrument developers and spacecraft/payload operations       all have the work of Smith and Sims at the UoB underpinning their       scientific objectives.
[text removed for publication] the former Head of ESA's Science       Technology and Future Science Missions Department, has confirmed the       continuing impact of the Birmingham research on these programmes as       follows: "... future missions in their early preparatory phases such as         the exploration of the Jovian moon Europa or Exoplanet characterisation,         instrument and mission design will again be influenced by the search for         organic molecules.
Without the research of Smith and Sims, these mission         concepts would be much more limited.
But now the search for complex         organics and potential bio-chemical signatures is on the agenda.
In         short, studies of the constituents of the interstellar medium and the         exploration of our solar system owe a debt to the work of Smith and         Sims.
Without their research we would still be designing missions with         for astronomy a mainly exploratory focus and for the solar system an         emphasis on geophysics.
This readjustment of the scientific objectives         will have far reaching implications on mission design, instrument         complement and ultimately cost."
[source 4]     NASA and ESA are currently pursuing separate missions (JUNO and JUICE       respectively) to the Jovian system acting as precursors with a key       long-term science objective to search for evidence of life &#8212; indeed JUICE       will search for evidence of habitability on these moons.
If one of these       missions does discover biological signatures this will have a profound       impact on mankind's place in the Solar System and the Universe.
While the       goal of these major missions is such a return, they are underpinned by the       fundamental scientific research on low temperature reaction rates and       species production conducted by Smith, Sims and their co-workers.
