     In 2006, Thompson and Bailey took the original `WildKey' application to       `Venturefest' &#8212; a major       investment opportunity platform for the South East of England, held       annually in Oxford.
This       generated considerable interest in commercialisation, with private equity       investment secured,       (&#163;100,000) to bring the software to market.
This led to the creation of       `WildKnowledge' in 2007, a       university spin-out company which specialises in developing software apps       that facilitate multi-media       data collection and collation.
The company has been managed by Bailey       since its launch       with Thompson as Chair and scientific advisor.
To date the company has continued to marry the research needs of its       clients to the creation of a       broad spectrum of new apps, regularly securing contracts with industry and       Government for further       research and development into the use of mobile systems for real-time data       collection and       management [1].
By 2008 `WildKnowledge' had created the complementary apps `WildForm',       `WildMap' and       `WildImage' which resulted in a second tranche of funding secured       (&#163;350,000) to add these       products to the market place and in the same year, they won the Public       Choice Award for       Innovation at Venturefest.
With the advent of the emerging IOS and Android devices market       `WildKnowledge' core staff       identified the need to transfer their Windows Mobile driven apps to those       compatible with these       platforms.
Central to this was the extensive re-writing of programmes       initially written to deliver the       original apps.
In 2010 a BBSRC-sponsored Knowledge Transfer Partnership       (KTP007850; total       project value &#163;144,220, including Company contribution &#163;47,593), allowed       Thompson in       collaboration with Professor David Duce &#8212; (Head of Web Technology and       Digital Forensics in       Computer Sciences at Brookes) to work with WildKnowledge (via a KTP       Associate) to facilitate the       repurposing of existing content.
This improved understanding later helped       in the development of a       platform for supporting the WildKey suite of software on high end devices       such as iPhone/Android,       thus bringing mobile computing/data collection to a new application era;       allowing them to appeal to       new markets outside the original remit (environmental data collection and       management), such as       Continued Professional Development, interactive multi-media heritage trail       construction and       distance learning [2].
The software has been utilised under contract to a variety of partners to       undertake work similar to       that for which it was originally designed, and therefore has impact on       conservation practitioners,       who have adopted a new technology to encourage various forms of `citizen       science', for example;     Ewaso Lions project &amp; Warrior Watch &#8212; WildKnowledge advised on       this project to construct an       app to help local tribesmen identify individual lions and record real-time       information about them.
Used this since 2011 [3], the app has provided a mechanism for evidencing       compensation       available as a consequence of human-wildlife conflict and to collect much       needed management       data on a rapidly declining species.
WildCru Ethiopian Wolf Conservation project (EWCP) &#8212; WildKnowledge       worked with the       WildCru research leader of the EWCP to provide an app toolkit for       monitoring the populations of       Ethiopian Wolves and to record their efforts in reducing disease impacts       to the wolves (e.g.
for       rabies vaccinations to feral dogs).
The toolkit is used by EWCP staff,       volunteers and local people       [4].
Earthwatch `Bee friend your garden' app &#8212; Launched June 2013, this       app enables UK-based       gardeners to help the bee population by learning what plants will       encourage bees into their       gardens, and also to learn about the species they see [5].
Currently       c.4000 downloads with 12,000       records uploaded.
These conservation-focussed apps have also opened up public education       prospects, aiding a       greater public understanding of conservation issues local to them and on a       global level;     Sussex Wildlife Trust (2011) &#8212; An app with very positive user       reviews designed to allow visitors       to explore SWT's nature reserves and learn about the wildlife there [6].
Finally, using WildKnowledge, we have also created apps beyond wildlife       conservation which are       improving public understanding of local and global conservation issues and       a greater engagement       of practice with `citizen science', facilitating access to the huge       resource of information that can be       generated using the public and special interest groups.
`Track the Ripper' 2012 &#8212; Gold Medal winning app in the 2012 Race         for Apps, which required       companies to devise `apps' that would enthuse visitors to the Olympics to       explore London.
Here       spatial data collecting expertise was combined into the app which retraces       the events surrounding       `Jack the Ripper' in Victorian times [7].
Paediatric Observation Priority Score (POPS) 2011 &#8212; POPS is a       rapid patient assessment tool       which quickly scores acutely ill children on a combination of       physiological, behavioural and risk       identifiers using easy to collect data.
A mobile app was created by       Leicester NHS Trust and a third       party, using adaptation of the original suite of WildKnowledge utilities       as the platform for data       collection.
The app helps to train junior doctors identify paediatric       conditions and enables staff       (even if inexperienced) to assess, prioritise and treat acutely ill       children, and manage risk in busy       clinical area.
The use of the form has coincided with a fall in       admissions.
[8]     SCAPE Trust, Scotland's Coastal Heritage @ Risk Project (SCH@RP) 2011       &#8212; enables amateur       archaeologists/the public to view and update records on thousands of       archaeological sites that are       threatened by erosion in Scotland.
[9]     The impacts demonstrated here are therefore on improving public       understanding of local and       global conservation issues and a greater engagement of practice with       `citizen science', facilitating       access to the huge resource of information that can be generated using the       public and special       interest groups.
Since its launch in 2007, WildKnowledge has established       itself as a successful       business through generation of revenue and continuing contracts with       external client/investors for       both commercial and R&amp;D projects.
