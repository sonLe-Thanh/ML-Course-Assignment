     In 1998 Chaney published The Evolution of the Grand Tour to great       acclaim; see selection of reviews on the back of the revised, paperback       edition.
It was chosen as `Book of the Year' by Jan Morris in the         Independent and was the lead feature by John Mortimer in the Sunday         Times.
Melvyn Bragg asked Chaney to talk about the book on Start         the Week (Radio 4).
After the publication of the revised and       enlarged paperback edition of this book by Frank Cass in 2000 (now in       print with Routledge) Bragg asked Chaney back to discuss it on In Our         Time in a special programme devoted to the Grand Tour (2002)       (audience figures in both cases in the millions:       http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00548fs).
As well as articles in Apollo,       the Burlington and London Magazines, he contributed entries       in the Dictionary of Art and the Oxford Dictionary of National         Biography (which he reviewed in the British Art Journal) and       to exhibition catalogues such as the Tate's Grand Tour.
This book       and his popular anthology on Florence underpinned the annual       student trips to Florence.
In 2006 Chaney was awarded a visiting       scholarship at the British School at Rome by the Mellon Centre for Studies       in British Art.
In all such venues he was able to promote his subject via       seminars, lectures and liaising with colleagues, students and members of       the public.
Meanwhile he co-curated and edited the catalogue for The Stuart         Portrait: Status and Legacy, a major loan exhibition at the       Southampton City Art Gallery in 2001.
Since then he has co-curated and       co-written Richard Eurich: 1903-1992: Visionary Artist (an       exhibition which travelled to Southampton, Bournemouth and London in 2003)       and contributed to Obsessions: R.B.
Kitaj 1932-2007 (2012) His       Kitaj essay has been singled out for praise.
He gave a related paper at       the Wyndham Lewis conference hosted by the University of London School of       Advanced Studies on Lewis and Kitaj in December 2012.
His catalogue essay       on Kitaj as Warburgian artist is being in revised and in more substantial       form in both English and French and has appeared in the E version of Melbourne         Art Journal (emaj); http://emajartjournal.com/2013/11/30/edward-chaney-r-b-kitaj-1932-2007-warburgian-artist/     Via the Grand Tour literature of visitors to Rome Chaney gradually became       more interested in what was said about ancient Egyptian artefacts and       early-modern speculation about Egyptian history and religion.
He gave a       paper on the reception of ancient 'Egypt in England and America' in Naples       in 2004 which was published in Sites of Exchange: European Crossroads         and Faultlines (Amsterdam and New York, 2006), after which he       published a more accessible, popular version in The London Magazine.
He also gave a paper on the Collector Earl of Arundel and the Obelisk of       Domitian which was eventually published in Roma Britannica in       2011.
On the basis of this research he applied to the Leverhulme Trust for       a Major Research Fellowship, awarded in 2010.
He gave a paper on       `Shakespeare and Egypt' to a large number of Egyptian students and members       of the public at the Alexandrian Library, Egypt, in early 2011 (just as       the `Arab Spring' was getting underway), and related papers in Oxford,       Cambridge, Chichester, London, Florence and Rome, where he gave the       opening, plenary lecture on `Torino Britannica and the Cultural Memory of       Egypt' at the Mellon-sponsored Torino Britannica conference held at the       British School and the Veneria Reale, Turin (20 June 2013) the proceedings       of which are to be published by Cambridge University Press.
Meanwhile, the       Kitaj exhibition opened at the Jewish Museum Berlin in July 2012 and has       since, thanks to his entrepreneurship, re-located to Pallant House,       Chichester, and the Jewish Museum London, whence it travelled in July 2013       to Hamburg's Kunsthalle.
This has been widely reviewed, discussed       on Radio 4 and the catalogue has appeared in German and English.
Chaney's       catalogue essay was singled out for praise by Tim Hyman in his Burlington         Magazine review.
In connection with this Chaney gave a paper on       Lewis and Kitaj in London in December 2012.
His expertise in the history       of collecting and interest in the welfare of the Southampton City Art       Gallery and its collections, enabled him to lead a successful campaign       against the proposed sale of works of art to fund the Titanic museum.
This       involved him appearing on BBC TV South and in radio debates with the       leader of the council, he further supported the campaign objectives by       publishing articles in local and national newspapers in the summer of       2009.
Where the history of collecting is concerned he advised on James       Stourton and Charles Sebag Montefiore's The British as Art Collectors       (Scala, 2012) as a result of which he was asked to act as consultant to       BBC 4's 2013 Great British Art Collectors , narrated by Lady Helen       Rosslyn.
Impact of `Roma Britannica and the Cultural Memory of Egypt: Lord Arundel       and the Obelisk of Domitian' (published by the British School at Rome in       their conference proceedings: Roma Britannica (2011).
Prof       Chaney's article on the Collector Earl of Arundel's attempt to acquire the       Obelisk of Domitian was initially given as a lecture at the British       School's `Roma Britannica' conference, and subsequently Southampton,       Arundel Castle (under the auspices of the Mellon Centre for Studies in       British Art), the British Institute in Florence and at the University of       Cambridge.
The idea was first mooted in Chaney, The Evolution of         English Collecting (New Haven and London, 2003), p. 105.
