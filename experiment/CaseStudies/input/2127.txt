     The impact of the technologies developed by Smales is primarily in the       area of enhanced protein       synthesis especially in relation to bioprocessing and the manufacture of       biopharmaceuticals.
The       technology has allowed the rapid generation of highly productive       industrial recombinant       monoclonal antibody producing cell lines.
Bioprocessing and       biotherapeutics are a major growth       area in the UK and are priority areas for funding bodies such as the       Technology Strategy Board       (TSB) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council       (BBSRC) [see 5.1].
The       global significance of protein-based therapeutics is highlighted by the       fact that they represented       11% of total global pharma sales in 2010.
Indeed, of the 21 new drugs       approved by FDA in that       year, six were proteins and there are now around 200 biopharmaceutical       products on the market       with about 15 having sales in the USA of greater than $1 billion.
Out of       the top ten       pharmaceuticals, six are recombinant proteins and this is predicted to       increase to eight out of ten       by 2014, with monoclonal antibodies continuing to be the dominant class of       protein.
The       importance of research and new technologies to underpin such processes was       recognised in the       BIGT (Bioscience 2015) report to the UK Government which, as one of its       six recommendations,       called for a need to "build a strong bioprocessing sector" [see         5.2].
The production of recombinant proteins in mammalian cells is very       expensive and therefore even       modest increases in the yield can represent a significant cost saving.
Smales' research directly       relates to the goal of improved recombinant protein production by       providing technology that leads       to the generation and rapid identification of advanced cell lines that can       be used in production       processes based on large-scale (anywhere from 100 to 20,000 L)       bioreactors.
By providing       technology that reduces the time for engineering and identifying highly       productive animal cell lines,       end-users are now achieving significant savings in the production of the       next generation of drugs       used to treat a wide range of diseases.
In particular, the technology has       led to a 30% reduction in       the time taken from transfection to having secured research/production       cell banks and completed       bioreactor evaluation from approximately 22 weeks to 15 weeks by reducing       the number of rounds       of screening [see 5.3].
The research outlined by Smales has five associated elements to the       overall impact as follows:             Commercial production of high value recombinant proteins.
By         working with Lonza         Biologics, a company involved in the custom manufacturing of         biopharmaceuticals, the technology         and developments in cell line construction and screening has not only         been patented [see 5.4], but         fed into the methods for the generation of recombinant cell lines,         helping to reduce the overall time         and cost of product development [see 5.3].
This has helped         maintained Lonza's position as a world         leader in process development for mammalian cell expression systems         including cell line         production.
Generation of new intellectual property.
By continuing to work         with Lonza Biologics on         technologies for enhanced recombinant protein production, the Smales         group have generated         further intellectual property resulting in the filing of a second patent         on the generation of         mammalian producer cells [see 5.5].
Development of a strong bioprocessing community in the UK.
Smales' success in         developing practical solutions to some of the challenges the         bioprocessing community faces has         led to his inclusion in the Bioprocessing Research Industry Club (BRiC)         panel.
The BRiC initiative         involves the BBSRC, EPSRC and 15 companies.
Together with Dickson         (University of         Manchester) Smales is leading a 2013 BBSRC-Network in Industrial         Biotechnology and Bioenergy         (NIBBs) initiative called Bioprocessing Network: BioProNET [see 5.6].
Sustaining and developing industry-HE links.
In the review         period Smales trained 14         industrially-affiliated PhD students.
Four of his PhD students         graduating during this period have         taken up posts in industry (Lonza Biologics x2, Isogenica and Pfizer)         while two others were         employees of a company.
By working closely with the biopharmaceutical         sector, Smales has been         able to train a new generation of young PhD level researchers uniquely         skilled to work in the         industrial bioprocessing/biopharmaceutical sector.
This in turn fosters         a closer working relationship         between academia and industry.
Furthering the impact of the research in the field of           bioprocessing.
As a recognised leader         in field of bioprocessing [see 5.6, 5.7, 5.8], Smales has been         awarded a Royal Society Industrial         Fellowship from October 2013 [see 5.9].
This involves part         secondment of Smales to work with         Lonza Biologics plc to continue his successful interaction with the         company and application of the         technology to enhanced therapeutic protein production.
