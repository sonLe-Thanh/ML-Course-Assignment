     Process/events from research to impact.
In 2012, the research findings were used to shape a business proposal to       deploy the new clinical pharmacy service model across NHS GGC.
In early       2013, NHS GGC in collaboration with Macmillan Cancer Support agreed       funding of &#163;508,200 for the period 2013 - 2016.
Also in 2012, the research findings supported a successful bid by NHS       Highland to Macmillan Cancer Support (&#163;105,000, 2013-2016) to explore the       service model within a remote and rural Health Board setting.
Prof Bennie       and Dr Akram, following competitive tender, secured &#163;45,000 funding from       Macmillan Cancer Support to conduct an evaluation of the project (2013 - 2014).
Macmillan Cancer Support have disseminated the NHS GGC project findings       across their UK network and have used the findings specifically to inform       two aspects of their work: the UK Boots and Macmillan Partnership and the       Macmillan Pharmacy Workforce Planning programme.
Types of impact            Clinical pharmacy service model designed and delivered through         influencing health policy and clinical practice       New resources for patients and their carers       New resources and staff development opportunities for the palliative         care team          Influence on health policy and clinical practice     The evolved service model is aligned to the NHS Scotland policy       frameworks in pharmacy and palliative care to maximise the complementary       contributions of the multidisciplinary team and ensure community pharmacy       teams play a central role in supporting the safe and effective use of       medicines for patients and their carers [Source C].
The model is designed       in a format that enables flexibility for the deployment of identified key       functions through local business planning and service delivery frameworks:            NHS GGC has initiated the roll-out of the service model to all 10         community health care partnerships (CHCPs) covering around 1.2 million         population, to improve access to palliative care medicines and         information provision from the 314 community pharmacies across NHS GGC         (2013) [Source D and G].
Statement from Project Lead [Source D]:            "The project findings have secured resource to expand the newly           designed service across the NHS board and have been instrumental in           developing the resources now used by GPs and Community Pharmacists to           support the palliative care needs of patients and carers.
In addition,           the findings have been more widely shared across Scotland and the UK,           for example, shaping the UK Boots and Macmillan partnership".
In 2013, NHS Highland appointed a Macmillan Pharmacist Palliative Care         Rural Practitioner to explore the applicability of the service model to         a remote and rural community (13,000 island population) [Source E, H].
The findings were presented to the Scottish Partnership for Palliative         Care West Regional Group and the Scottish Palliative Care Pharmacists'         Association to support dissemination (2012) [Source D].
The findings were presented (2012) to the Macmillan Cancer Support         Health Care Programme Management Group, disseminated across the UK         network and are being used to inform specific work programs.
For         example, the capacity planning model is informing the pharmacy workforce         development programme within Macmillan Cancer Support [Source D, E].
The findings are showcased by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society         (professional body for Pharmacy) as evidence of good pharmacy practice         and innovation [Source I].
New resources for patients and carers            Information leaflets that contained details of how to source medicines         that are not routinely available are now provided to patients/carers.
This has empowered patients to better assist health care professionals         in accessing medicines and thus reducing delays in care provision (e.g.
levomepromazine 6 mg tablets for severe nausea and vomiting - an         unlicensed formulation used in palliative care) [Source F].
The findings have informed the development of the UK Boots and         Macmillan Partnership which by mid-2013 has recruited over 1000 UK Boots         Macmillan Information Pharmacists who have been provided with Macmillan         resources (in part informed by our research) to better support patients         and carers in the community [Source E].
New resources and staff development opportunities for palliative care         team            A single comprehensive Palliative Care Resource Folder was developed         and distributed to all 314 NHS GGC community pharmacies in 2011 [Source         A].
The folder was also made available through the Scottish Palliative         Care Pharmacists Association to all NHS Scotland Health Boards.
Through         the Macmillan UK network, requests for the folder have also been         received from Lincolnshire (England) and Wales.
A new face-to-face training programme was designed for pharmacy         counter assistants and dispensing staff to support engagement with         patients/carers and health care professionals to improve medicines         supply and palliative care advice services.
In 2011, a total of 98 staff         participated in the program [Source D].
A new e-learning resource on palliative care for pharmacy technicians         was commissioned by NHS Education for Scotland (NES) and made available         nationally from 2012 [Source B].
An information leaflet (signposting community pharmacy services and         advice available) was designed and distributed to all 314 community         pharmacy, 260 General Practices and other primary care settings across         NHS GGC (2012) [Source D].
A Prescribing Aide for GPs to assist with appropriate and legal         prescribing of end-of-life medicines was distributed to all 260 NHS GGC         General Practices in 2011.
This saw improvements in patient safety and a         reduction in medicines wastage and staff time including; targeted         messaging on the correct strength/formulation of midazolam injection saw         an increase in appropriate and accurate prescribing rates from &lt;50%         to 72%, projected efficiency savings of ~&#163;25,000, and efficiencies         through "releasing nursing time to care" [Source D].
