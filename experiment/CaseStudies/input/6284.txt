     CRESS employs two non-academic staff plus regular internships and       apprentices to meet its workload in knowledge exchange (KE) activities and       to build capacity.
Our effectiveness in translating high quality       scientific research into policy and practice on an on-going basis is       reflected in a list of regular clients that include SNH, SEPA, EA, RSPB,       SNIFFER, DEFRA, Scottish Government and industry (e.g.
Scottish Power,       Scottish Coal).
Since 2008 CRESS staff participated directly in 55       UK-based projects that focus on restoration of physical habitat and water       quality to improve ecological status, as prescribed under the EU Water       Framework Directive (WFD).
CRESS activities have proved highly influential       in awareness raising, stakeholder engagement, training of professionals       and in underpinning policy and guidance.
For example Dr Roger Owen, Head       of Ecology at the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) remarked       that `Willby has very significantly influenced and assisted the         practical application of biological assessment methods for         implementation of the WFD at UK and EU level.
The quality of Dr Willby's         work has been outstanding and is well recognised within the European         Commission' (see Factual Statements).
CRESS has also been heavily       involved with Scotland's Centre of Expertise for Waters (CREW) established       to connect research with policy impact.
For example, the team jointly led       the `Diffuse Pollution Management' project that prioritised measures for       improving water quality under the next phase of Scottish Rural Development       Programme (SRDP) funding.
CRESS initiatives have contributed measurably to the protection and       enhancement of aquatic systems and the goods and services they deliver.
The following projects showcase a variety of traceable impacts (letters         in bold refer to corroborating sources in section 5):            The NERC KE project, Carbon Landscapes and Drainage (CLAD), led to the         production of Carbon and Water guidelines, a re-evaluation of carbon         savings from wind-farms due to peat losses, training in aquatic carbon         flux monitoring in England, Scotland, Eire and Malaysia and publicity on         the importance of peatland management in climate change policy.
This         stemmed from our studies of carbon losses from peatlands impacted by         windfarm development.
A        Intercalibration of Water Framework Directive methods: we designed the         approaches adopted by the EU to determine the comparability of national         methods of assessment of surface waters.
This process is of fundamental         importance because it ensures parallel ambition and investment in         protection of water resources across the 27 EU member states.
B, C        Improved modelling of relationships between primary producers and         nutrients in rivers has allowed us to derive site-specific regulatory         targets for phosphorus with defined uncertainties, replacing general         standards for which the uncertainty was un-quantified.
These targets         have now been subject to public consultation and subsequently adopted by         UK administrations (UK Technical Advisory Group on WFD) and will dictate         significant capital spending.
C, D        Based on studies of fish behaviour in relation to flow and barriers to         upstream migration CRESS designed a tool allowing prioritisation of         barrier removal to restore salmonid fisheries (EA, SEPA).
Over 3000km of         river identified via this tool have been restored and now have improved         fish access and 70 experts across the UK have been trained in the use of         the tool.
E        The `Scottish Rivers Handbook' was lead-authored by CRESS on behalf of         CREW and designed to give an overview of the physical character of         Scotland's rivers and to educate people on working with river processes         in a sympathetic manner by explaining the forms, functions and benefits         of rivers to society.
The book was distributed to River and Fishery         Trusts and riparian landowners throughout Scotland and at major         stakeholder events and was downloaded 500 times within the first six         months of publication.
F        Our work on trends in catchment scale river restoration practices for         SEPA was quoted in the Scottish Parliament in 2009 during the reading of         the Flood Risk Management Bill.
G        Our pathogen fate and transfer data have been used by the US         Department of Agriculture to parameterise the extension of an         international model (the Soil &amp; Water Assessment Tool) for         predicting microbial pollution in agricultural catchments.
H        We have trialled and improved approaches for engaging stakeholders in         diffuse pollution control (CREW) and evaluated strategies to assess the         effectiveness of diffuse pollution mitigation policy in Scotland.
Scottish Government commissioned this work to help inform revisions to         the next round of the Scottish Rural Development Programme.
I        The NERC KE project led by Stirling "Delivering Healthy Water"         established a working group to provide a mechanism for the exchange of         knowledge, experience and evidence between academic, regulatory and         public stakeholders with regard to new technologies and `rapid methods'         for assessing bathing water quality.
We produced a decision-making         framework and associated briefing papers to underpin and guide future         decision-making ahead of the review of the Bathing Water Directive.
