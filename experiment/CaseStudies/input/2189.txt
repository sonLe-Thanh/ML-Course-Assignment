     Burton's research has helped to stimulate public and practitioner debate       around the connections between sculpture, ceramics, craft and       architecture.
The research has had a worldwide reach, achieved through the       public exhibition of artworks and through Burton's contribution to       practitioner focused workshops and conference presentations.
His work has       reached large audiences, enriching their cultural experiences and has       engaged niche communities, such as bamboo breakers and dung workers       (pictured left) in India whose practices reach new audiences through       public exhibitions.
Impact on cultural life: public opportunities to experience forms of         new artistic expression Burton's artworks make an explicit physical       and visual connection between craft (e.g.
brick as a form of fired       ceramic/ bamboo weaving), architecture (brick as a ubiquitous building       material) and sculpture.
These qualities of Burton's work have been       highlighted by The British Council which states: "[Burton's] projects are       a response to the materiality of the world.
By using commonly found and       low value objects and substances such as brick, dung or bamboo to build       simple structures, often architectural in appearance, but on an unexpected       scale, we are invited to look again at the world immediately around us."
(http://creativeconomy.britishcouncil.org/people/andrew-burton/).
The poetic materiality of Burton's art works has also been explored by       architectural journalist Robert Such in his (2009) article for Art and       Architecture Journal.
Such writes: "Jug, as with Burton's other       artworks created from the debris of former sculptures, embodies a sense of       continuity with the past, whilst at the same time signifying the       inevitable decay of its surroundings.
Works such as this also point to       ways of recycling demolition material into the new fabric of a city,       leaving its visual traces there to remind us of a site's history prompting       perhaps even personal memories, and the experiencing of a sense of       belonging to a place" (IMP1).
The importance of Burton's       sculptural investigation of material `decline and regeneration' has also       been highlighted by maker-curator Helen Carnac, in her online showcase of       artists `Making and Unmaking, Repair and Repetition', commissioned by the       major UK visual arts practitioner's website Axis (http://www.axisweb.org,2010).
This online exhibition was subsequently selected as one of 21       Axis highlights for its 21st Birthday year 2012 (IMP2).
In creating artworks for public presentation in urban sites and       exhibition venues across the world: in Asia, North America and Europe,       Burton's works have carried this distinctive sculpture-architecture-craft       dialogue to a large public, within and beyond the traditional arts       audience.
Many of these are publicly sited works, where audiences, both       deliberate `visitors' and regular passers-by are invited to touch and       experience the sculpture in a more direct way than a gallery-based work.
Burton's sculpture Chimney is permanently sited at Westferry       Circus, Canary Wharf, London, as part of the award winning Canary Wharf       public art collection.
With around 100,000 people working at Canary Wharf       every day this work has been seen and experienced by many thousands of       people since 2008.
In an email to Burton, one viewer commented on her own       personal enjoyment of this work: `I saw [your work] on a very wet day with       dark grey skies but with the park looking wonderfully green and acting as       an exciting backdrop to the rich terracotta of your sculptures.'
(IMP3,         IMP4).
In `Ceramic City &#8212; Design for Public Space' (Stoke-on-Trent, Oct-Dec       2009) Burton's work was exhibited as part a major city-wide festival       celebrating and showcasing contemporary ceramics from across the world.
The exhibition of Burton's work was visited by a public audience of       10,000+ (http://www.britishceramicsbiennial.com).
Burton's work Jug, won one of the festival's Public Art Awards.
His work was featured in a four-page article and used as the back-cover       image for the special ceramic biennial issue of Art and Architecture       Journal (Autumn 2009) (IMP5).
Burton's work Bittern was commissioned for the Environmental Park       at the Shanghai World Expo `Better City &#8212; Better Life' (2010).
While exact viewer figures for publicly sited artworks are unattainable,       the Expo overall attracted a record breaking 73m visitors over its 184       days, the majority being Chinese visitors (http://english.eastday.com/e/111001/u1a6133087.html).
The value of Burton's interdisciplinary contribution to the fine art and       crafts field is further evidenced by the inclusion of his work in a       variety of contemporary visual arts publications.
These include: reference       to Burton's sculptural ceramics in the survey work `Contemporary Ceramics'       (2009) by the highly respected crafts writer and critic Emmanuel Cooper, a       publication reviewed as "an essential work" (The Sunday Telegraph) and "a       sourcebook of the highest caliber" (Crafts Magazine) (IMP5); `Out       of India' a four page feature on Burton's Indian inspired works written by       Robert Such for the international ceramic art and craft magazine Ceramic       Review (Jan/Feb 2010.
Readership: 40,000 per issue) (IMP6);       inclusion in `Ruby: Other Wordliness' (2011) a survey of contemporary       artists working at the cross-over of art and culture compiled by       Argentinian artist-curator Irana Douer (IMP7); and a four-page       interview with Burton in the French catalogue publication `S'imbriquer &#8212;       Autour de la Brique' (Artists and Bricks) (2011) (IMP8).
Impact on public discourse: stimulating practitioner-led debate within         fine art, architecture and craft     Burton has been invited to lecture on his work internationally and is an       active contributor to international fine art and ceramics conferences and       symposia, being invited to present his projects and to share his research       and working practices with arts and crafts practitioners in the UK and in       Europe.
Presentations have included:            `Sensuous Knowledge: Reflection, Relevance, Responsibility' (Bergen         Art Academy, Norway, 2009) a three-day annual gathering of 85         practitioners.
Here Burton's research on ceramic brick as a sculptural         medium was shared as a case study with artists and curators seeking to         evaluate new routes for artistic research and development.

Here Burton contributed to the conference session `Guerrilla         Ceramics - The ecology of the ceramic object - Political ceramic         statements'.
The YouTube video (www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIF2zGMKIA8)         of Burton's talk has received 588 views (to date).
The ceramic industry conference `European Ceramic Context' (Bornholm,         Denmark, 2010).
A major international gathering of ceramics and glass         practitioners and researchers, this conference addressed the situation         of ceramic art and ceramic artists in the present cultural and         industrial economy.
Burton's conference presentation 'Making Bricks'         considered basic methods of brick production in India showing how this         had inspired a contemporary sculptural language.

Burton's presentation his work in India contributed to         the debate by highlighting some of the ethical and creative         considerations involved in cross-cultural practice.

Burton has also received invitations to contribute to many arts research       and education initiatives.
These include invitations from: Clare Twomey       and Edmund de Waal to speak at the conference `Collaboration &#8212; research in       ceramics now', University of Westminster Ceramics Research Centre (June       2010); five academis in Belgium, including the Academy of Visual Arts,       Mechelen, to present his research as part of a project on architectural       ceramics, `Architec-Tour' (2011-2013); the Gerrit Rietveld Academie,       Amsterdam to lecture on his work in India to a joint group of architecture       and ceramics working on a collaborative and experimental brick project (IMP9).
