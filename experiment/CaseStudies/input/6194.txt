     The impact of the research during the assessment period of 2008 - 2013 is       notable for its broad reach and significance for a number of       beneficiaries.
The e-Petitioner system has been used by the Scottish       parliament (Section 5, evidence 1) and the Bundestag in Germany (Section       5, evidence 1).
It is currently used by 24 local authorities across the UK       (Section 5, evidence 6).
It is used by the student union at King's       College, London (Section 5, evidence 3) and by local authorities across       Europe (Section 5, evidence 4).
The software company Public-I built an       open source e-petitions system for Bristol City Council, based on the ITC       system and supported by ITC consultancy (Section 5, evidence 5).
The Scottish Parliament used the ITC e-petitions until August 2012 and       are still using the system to track petitions submitted up to August 2011.
A total of 1344 petitions were processed by the system.
A report on the       use of the e-petitioner system for the Bundestag (Section 5, Evidence 1)       states:     "The Scottish Parliament was the first elected assembly in the world to       introduce an electronic petition system and integrate it into       parliamentary procedure.
In particular, the technological functionalities       of internet-based signing and discussion of petitions on the E-Petitioner       system have attracted considerable international attention and recognition       by academics and politicians alike. "
ITC translated and adapted e-Petitioner for the German Bundestag.
This       was used during the assessment period and received a very positive review       by Riehm, B&#246;hle and Linder (Section 5, Evidence 1).
They comment "Judging       by the popularity of the e-petition platform alone, public petitions can       be seen as an unqualified success.
The share of electronically submitted       petitions to the German Bundestag rose from 17% in 2006 to 34% in 2010.
At       the same time, public petitions appear to be particularly attractive for       citizens, since their share of submitted petitions rose from 5% to 24%.
Overall, from September 2005 to the end of 2010, more than 3 million       signatures were counted for about 2,100 public petitions, and more than       100,000 written contributions to discussions were posted on the forums."
As stated above, the e-Petitioner system is used by 24 local authorities       across the UK (See Section 5, Evidence 6).
For example, the Royal Borough       of Kingston were using the e-Petitioner service in April 2009 and 17       petitions, with a total of 561 signatures were raised between 1/01/2008       and 31/03/2009.
Birmingham City Council have a very active e-petitioner       site and Bristol has 255 petitions at various stages of being processed.
The e-petition web site gives this example:     "Bristol City Council was one of the first councils to use our ePetition       system and has seen significant participation since the system started in       January 2008.
One petition has seen more than 30,000 signatories, while       another has seen in excess of 10,000. Notable petitions have included:-       Better lighting and more police patrols on the cycle path: a petition       pressed for a safer cycle route to encourage greater cycle use into the       city and improvements in related environmental and community safety       issues.
Keep Banksy: a petition called for a piece of street art by artist Banksy       to be kept following demands for its removal.
Following widespread,       support the piece was preserved."
(Reference from Evidence 6)     Figures supplied by the data controller at Public-I for the assessment       period 2008 - 2013 lists 1185 petitions at 32 institutions across Europe       with 124,569 unique signatories (Evidence 8).
Thus there is considerable       reach and significance of this case study for society and culture and for       the empowerment of individual citizens.
