     Since 2008 Childs' research has improved women's parliamentary       representation in the UK by influencing thinking, agendas, legislation and       political practices in the following ways:     Agenda setting, legislation and changing political practices:       Childs' lead co-authored Hansard Report of 2005 [2] was featured on Radio       4's flagship `Today' programme, commented on in Parliament's House       magazine and launched in Parliament &#8212; the Rt Hon Theresa May (then Shadow       Secretary of State for Transport and former Party Chairman) spoke to the       Report's conclusions [d].
This publication contributed to the decision to       establish a Speaker's Conference on Parliamentary Representation in       November 2008 and to Childs' appointment as its Special Adviser [e].
In       that role she directly impacted evidence gathering, public dissemination       and Conference consultation processes: she provided briefings and data,       responses to written evidence, and prepared questions for witnesses;       participated in evidence gathering sessions in Parliament and throughout       the UK; and appeared on BBC Radio 4 `You and Yours' [a] [b] [f].
The       Conference worked through 2009 into early 2010.
During this time, Childs       also participated in a private meeting with MPs and the Independent       Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) to discuss MPs' pay and expenses,       and possible impacts on the supply of women candidates [a].
The Speaker's       Conference published its final Report in January 2010.
It included       analysis, data, conceptual frameworks and recommendations which drew on       Childs' research [1] [2] [3] [4].
The Report included the following       recommendations influenced by Childs: paragraph 143 relating to parties'       equality policies; the extension to the Sex Discrimination (EC) Act sunset       clause; discussion of sex quotas [11] [4], including `serious       consideration' of prescriptive quotas; reviewing House sitting hours,       party selection procedures and outcome monitoring; and regular       Parliamentary debate on women's representation.
Parties now monitor       selection more and provide some data, and the sunset clause was extended       in the 2010 Equality Act.
The concept of `critical mass' &#8212; which retains       considerable purchase amongst political actors, the media and public &#8212; was       not directly used in the Report due to Childs' intervention [3].
The       Labour Party's 2010 General Election manifesto said that it would `take       forward' the Conference's proposals [g] and continues to use sex quotas.
Following up the Conference on pay, participation and parenting:       Since the Conference, Childs has extended the agenda-setting impact of her       research on three issues related to its work, namely pay, increased       women's political participation, and parenting.
On pay, the 2010 IPSA       consultation document raised the issue of the relationship between salary       and diversity of candidates.
Childs was amongst a group of academics who       participated in IPSA meetings in 2012 to discuss MPs' pay [a].
In these       sessions Childs made contributions based on her previous research on the       issues of, inter alia, job-sharing by MPs and childcare costs due to the       nature of MPs' work and hence the need for a higher salary, which IPSA has       recommended [1] [6].
On participation and representation, the Conference,       and Childs' role therein, contributed to the creation in 2010 of the civil       society campaign group Counting Women In (www.countingwomenin.org)       which combines the Electoral Reform Society, Hansard Society, Fawcett       Society, Centre for Women and Democracy and Unlock Democracy.
Childs and       Ruth Fox (Director and Head of Research of the Hansard Society) wrote the       group's founding charter and helped to set up its organisational structure       [e].
Childs continues to be an active member.
Childs appeared as an expert       witness before the Commons Procedure Committee in 2011 in relation to       sitting hours due to her research on that issue [1] [4] [6] and submitted       written evidence.
This issue remains live on the agenda of parliamentary       reformers.
On parenting, Childs and Campbell (Birkbeck) submitted to IPSA       research they conducted in 2012-13 on the need for family-friendly hours       in the House to lower this barrier to participation.
The research was       facilitated by the Speaker and Anne Foster, Parliament's Head of Diversity       and Inclusion.
Promoting adoption of strong equality promotion measures in the         Conservative Party: Awareness in the Conservative Party of women's       under-representation has been heightened by Childs' research [c] [d].
Leading Conservative women, including Baroness Jenkin [c] and Theresa May       [d], drew on Childs' research [1] [2] in their creation of a new group       within the party -Women2Win www.women2win.com       &#8212; in 2005 which advocates a gender balance of candidates that reflects the       composition of British society overall.
Childs spoke at Women2Win's launch       and at its fifth anniversary conference in 2010.
There has been particular       interest in the Conservative Party in Childs' identification of specific       party-level strategies to enhance women's representation, and to address       the party's lack of `demand' for women candidates [2] [c] [d].
Childs was       also invited to meet with individuals from David Cameron's team in advance       of his election as leader in December 2005.
Women's representation became       a key dimension of Cameron's leadership campaign and subsequent party       modernization which included a series of selection reforms prior to the       2010 General Election.
In his evidence to the Speaker's Conference [f] in       2009 Cameron stated that the party would introduce some All Women       Shortlists in advance of the election, a measure which Childs had       championed in her research [1] [2] [4] and within the Conference, in       Woment2Win and when meeting Cameron's team.
Childs had private       conversations with Theresa May during her tenure as Shadow Secretary of       State for Work and Pensions 2009-10 [d].
Childs has provided May with       research-based data and arguments [4] [5] which have supported May's       advocacy efforts among her senior colleagues.
Aiming at the next General       Election, Baroness Jenkin met with No.
10 in 2011 armed with a briefing by       Childs on selection reforms based on research published the following year       [5] [6].
Following the establishment of a new Conservative parliamentary       grouping in December 2011 &#8212; the Conservative Women's Organisation www.conservativewomen.org.uk       &#8212; Childs briefed Conservative MPs on arguments, data and reform derived       from her research in progress [5] [6] [c].
Promoting sex-balanced leadership in the Labour Party: Childs'       book on New Labour women MPs [1] in particular has contributed to her       decade-long academic association with leading Labour women MPs, not least       the Rt Hon Harriet Harman (whose posts since 2008 have included Leader of       the House of Commons and Secretary of State for Equalities and Minister       for Women) and Dame Anne Begg (Vice-Chairman of the Speaker's Conference)       [a].
In 2010 Childs participated in a private meeting of the Fabian       Society to discuss gender and the Labour leadership contest.
In 2011, at       Harman's invitation, Childs was a lead author of the Political Studies       Association's Women and Politics Specialist Group briefing to Harman on       sex-balancing Labour's leadership.
The briefing identified mechanisms such       as the Leader and Deputy Leader having to be of different sexes that would       deliver that outcome: the measures are still being considered.
Promoting action by the Liberal Democrats on women's         under-representation: Early in 2013 Childs presented written and       oral evidence to the party's investigation into women's representation at       Westminster.
Based on her research [1] [4] [5], Childs argued for sex       quotas and job-shares.
The party has been exploring the issue of MP       job-shares as of February 2013 [i] and and it became public in October       2013 that the Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is       considering the adoption of All Women Shortlists for the 2020 General       Election [j].
