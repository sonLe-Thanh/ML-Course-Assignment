     This work makes a unique contribution to the development of advanced       nursing roles by providing a robust theoretical framework to guide the       assessment of the impact of these roles.
The provision of a practical       toolkit, based on this framework, to assist advanced practitioners to       demonstrate their impact is a unique resource.
All research outputs are       downloadable from the project website (Source 1) (which has had 1874 hits)       and include:            the composite toolkit       a series of reflective activities       a series of tools and instruments to capture impact       spreadsheets and coding sheets for use with some of the data         collection instruments       guidance on return on investment and capturing economic aspects of         advanced roles Both the theoretical framework and the practical guidance         were disseminated through a variety of activities designed to engage the         clinical community.
The Executive Summary for the NC study and a flyer         describing the toolkit was sent to the Chief Nurse in every NHS Trust in         England and Wales (May 2012).
A dissemination event attended by 53 Nurse         Consultants and their managers from across the UK was held: 'Capturing         the Impact of Nurse Consultant Roles: tips, tools &amp; techniques'         (April 2012).
The research findings have also been presented at national         and international conferences and by invited keynote presentations to         groups including: the Consultant Nurse Association for England (Mental         Health and Learning Disabilities) (Sept 2012) and the Nursing, Midwifery         and Allied Health Professions Consultant Network in Lanarkshire,         Scotland (Dec 2012).
A news item 'Because you're worth it' was published         in the Nursing Standard in July 2013 (Source 2).
The Nursing Standard         has an average weekly circulation of &gt;61,000.
Beneficiaries of this         research include policymakers, professional organisations and NHS         providers and individual practitioners.
Impact on policymakers       McDonnell and Gerrish were approached by a senior official from the       Workforce Directorate of the Department of Health in Sept 2012 with a       request to develop a proposal to adapt the toolkit for use by Health       Visitor Practice Teachers in order to demonstrate their impact on student,       professional and organisational outcomes.
A decision regarding the funding       of this work by the DoH was still awaited on 31 July 2013.
Impact on professional organisations and NHS providers       The toolkit is highlighted on and is available for download from the       websites of the following organisations:       The Knowledge Network Scotland       http://www.knowledge.scot.nhs.uk/media/CLT/ResourceUploads/4005511/AHPConsultantImpactN         C%20Toolkit%20final.pdf       The Forum of Mental Health &amp; Learning Disability Nurse Directors and       Leads       http://www.mentalhealthforum.org.uk/index.php/consultant-nurse-association       Nottingham University Hospitals Research and Innovation extranet       http://nuhrise.org/2011/11/measuring-nurse-consultant-impact-on-patient-professional-and-         organisational-outcomes/       Centre for Nurse and Midwife Led Research http://www.cnmr.org.uk/article.php?article=431     The toolkit is highlighted in 'SCAN' Senior Nurse/Midwife Current       Awareness from Northern Ireland Practice and Education Council August       2012.
The Foundation for Nursing Studies sent a news release detailing the       toolkit and included a link to the project website to everyone on their       mailing list (n &gt; 6000), 16th July 2012 (Source 3).
Three       organisations contacted the research team directly in 2012, following the       dissemination event, to express an interest in working with us to support       them to use the toolkit in practice to capture the impact of their nursing       and allied health professional consultants:            The Consultant Nursing, Midwifery and Allied Health Professional         (CNMAHP) Forum for Wales (Source 4)       Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (Source 5)       Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (Source 1) 	           The research team conducted a workshop with all or the majority of the         consultants in each organisation in Jan 2013, Feb 2013 and April 2013         respectively, following which the consultants used the toolkit in         practice.
The process finished with a further workshop on each site to         reflect on the process and for users to provide feedback on what aspects         of their work had benefited from the toolkit and any challenges they         faced when using it.
The roles within these three organisations covered         a wide range of clinical specialties including paediatrics, critical         care, gynaecology, stroke services, accident and emergency, frail older         people and mental health.
Examples of the impact the toolkit has had         include: helping to evaluate a newly established Integrated Children's         Centre, evaluating patient experience in Accident and Emergency in order         to inform service development and assessing patient and parent         satisfaction in order to improve a nurse-led adolescent Chronic Fatigue         Service.
The CNMAHP Forum for Wales also plan to use the framework as         the basis for their annual report (Source 4).
Reports are available on         the project website (Source 1).
In 2012, at the suggestion of the Director of Nursing, the Specialist       Nurse Forum at South Tees NHS Foundation Trust developed a six month       project to capture the impact of all the Specialist Nurses and Advanced       Nurse Practitioners working within the organisation using an adapted       version of the toolkit 'Capturing Impact: A Practical Toolkit for Nurse       Consultants'.
The chair of the Forum described the toolkit as 'completely       inspirational' and added `It allowed accurate, validated articulation of       `what our jobs really were about', clarified thoughts and really focused       attention to key areas efficiently and accurately.'
A report detailing       this project is available on the NC project website (Source 1).
The framework for capturing impact was also used in a scoping exercise of       nursing, midwifery, pharmacy and Allied Health Professional consultants in       a large NHS Foundation Trust.
By using the framework to gather information       on their activities and impact the consultants were able to communicate       effectively with the senior managers and the Trust Board about their       contribution to the organisation.
This allowed the organisation to have a       clear vision of where the consultants fitted within the Corporate       Framework and allow informed decisions to be made about how to make best       use of the skills of this diverse group (Source 6).
The toolkit is also a       useful training resource and was used in the consultant midwife training       programme in Hampshire and Isle of Wight Strategic Health Authority to       guide completion of professional portfolios (Source 6).
The framework for capturing impact was used as the conceptual framework       in research commissioned by the National Council for the Professional       Development of Nursing and Midwifery (NCNM) in the Republic of Ireland to       evaluate the role and outcomes of the Clinical Nurse/Midwife Specialist       (CNS/CMS) and Advanced Nurse/Midwife Practitioner (ANP/AMP) roles in       Ireland (Source 7).
The toolkit has also been used as the basis of an       evaluation of Nurse Consultant posts in a study funded by the Queen's       Nursing Institute for Scotland, this being a partnership project between       McMillan Rome Ltd, Edinburgh Napier University and the James Hutton       Institute (Source 8).
Impact on individual practitioners       Nursing and midwifery consultants in England, Scotland and Wales were       invited to complete an online survey to capture feedback on the toolkit       between Feb and May 2013.
41 responses were received (Source 1).
The ways       in which the toolkit had been used included:            helping individuals to reflect on their impact       to inform the individual's annual appraisal       to capture impact in practice          Other examples of impact on individuals include the following:            a physiotherapist applying for a post as a Rehabilitation Consultant         used the framework and the toolkit to formulate his presentation at the         recruitment event.
An email sent on 22nd March 2012 stated 'I have been         offered the rehabilitation consultant post.
I used the framework in the         toolkit as the framework for my presentation, which went down very well         (all referenced to yourselves).
They seemed particularly pleased with         the range of stakeholders and variety of potential impacts' (Source 9).
A nurse consultant used the toolkit to build a case for the         continuation of their post.
An email sent on 7th Dec, 2011         stated 'I would like to use (the toolkit) to evaluate my own         role because my employer is reviewing the roles of all non ward based         nurses and I need all the evidence I can prepare for the review'.
