     Reporting directly to the DoH Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation       (ACRA), Bailey and       team successfully developed and implemented two different modelling       frameworks during the       feasibility study [4] referred to in Section 2.
The first was aimed at       acute specialities and illustrated       in the project report [see evidence item a] through generation of       GP practice based estimates of       resource needs across England for the treatment of each of cardiovascular       disease,       endocrine/metabolic disease and diabetes.
It involved modelling the       log-odds of self-reported       longstanding illness (LSI) in specific illness categories from individuals       included in the Health       Survey for England (HSfE) over a number of years.
To do this Binomial       multi-level Bayesian       models including random effects and a range of individual,       socio-demographic, socio-economic       and geographical variables were employed.
A computationally intensive       micro-simulation of sub       populations in each GP practice nationally was then generated using       iterative proportional fitting       applied to available OPCS small area census data tables.
An       age/sex/illness specific resource       need distribution was then sampled for each sub-population from national       historic costs drawn from       the `Hospital Episodes Statistics' (HES) dataset.
Results were combined to       derive an estimate of       the total resource required to treat each condition within each GP       practice.
The second approach pioneered by Bailey and the modelling team in the       feasibility project study       report [see evidence item b], and then subsequently refined in the       second research project [5]       referred to in Section 2 and its associated report [c], was aimed       specifically at the difficult area of       adult mental health.
It sought to determine the probability that       particular individuals will fall into one       of a number of case mix categories based upon a classification of adult       mental health care       combining clinically agreed and coherent treatment pathways with       iso-resource patient groups (i.e.
groups of patients that make similar resource demands on the NHS).
In       order to implement this       approach, adults in the HSfE are classified as having needs in five       casemix mental health groups.
Then, paralleling the modelling of the approach for acute specialties       (except that a multinomial       rather than binomial Bayesian hierarchical model is fitted), individuals'       socio-demographic and       other characteristics are related to their casemix category.
This       multinomial model is then applied       to micro simulated sub-populations to obtain estimates of the number of       people in each casemix       category in each practice.
Relative resource needs are attached to       practices on the basis of       national per capita costs within the casemix.
In 2009/10 primary care trusts in the UK spent &#163;8.08 billion on       secondary care mental health and       an additional &#163;8.37 billion in 2010/11 through PCB.
The mental       health component of PCB includes       the Community Health Services budget for adult mental illness, child and       adolescent psychiatry,       forensic psychiatry and old age psychiatry.
Services provided under the       mental illness component       include; continuing care, crisis teams, early psychosis intervention and       hospitalisation.
In 2006, the department of health (DoH) released the PBC toolkit which       was recommended for use       in 2007 and is used by GPs and medical professionals to allocate resources       to practices in the UK.
In the period 2007-2009 results of the research described above       were presented by Bailey and       Asthana to the DoH Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA) and       influenced thinking in       this group.
ACRA was established in September 1997 as the successor body       to the Resource       Allocation Group (RAG).
ACRA directly advises the Secretary of State for       Health on the       distribution of resources across primary and secondary care to ensure that       these fully reflect local       population need and operate as fairly as possible.
Members include       academics, NHS senior       managers and GPs.
In 2009/10 the DoH implemented new changes to the toolkit [a]       which included an entirely new       methodology for the mental health component of the toolkit developed by       Bailey and Asthana [see       evidence item b and evidence item c].
It was described by       the DoH in their PBC budget guidance       for 2009/10 as `The new methodology has undergone extensive         testing by researchers and the         department of health and we believe it provides a step change         improvement in the way we model         mental health need'.
In 2009/10 the model was used by PCTs,       GPs and medical professionals       responsible for the practice based resource allocation to distribute &#163;8.08       billion pounds worth of       services for mental health.
In 2010/11 an 'improved' version of the methodology was       implemented in the Practice-based         commissioning budget guidance for 2010/11 [evidence item d]       which utilises a full multilevel model       that separately captures individual and area-level effects.
The new       methodology was extensively       tested by the Department of Health and was overseen by the advisory       committee on Resource       Allocations.
According to the NHS `Capturing both these effects makes         the estimates more         responsive to the needs of each practices population'.
Similarly in       2010/11, the model was used to       distribute &#163;8.37 billion of primary care services for mental health.
The       National Audit Office's       Cross-government landscape: Formula funding of local public services       references the project       [evidence item e] as having `so far informed practice-based         commissioning, and may also form the         basis for allocations to clinical commissioning groups in the future'.
According to the Chief Economist/Deputy Chief Analyst of the Department       of Health, who is a       member of ACRA [evidence item f]:     `It was Trevor Bailey who helped operationalize the new approach that         did not rely on past         utilization of service.
This was particularly important for mental         health where utilization data was         patchy and represented the "old model" of service provision with over         reliance on hospital         inpatients.
Trevor Bailey implemented an innovative approach based on         directly observed         morbidity indicators at individual level, rather than utilization at         area level.
This was known as         Person Based resource Allocation (PBRA) and the technique was piloted in         2007 and successfully         implemented in 2007/8.
The highly computational technique using 40,000         Health Survey for         England data records led to a new formula being used to set target         allocations for &#163;8bn of funding         for mental health services for General Practice in 2009/10 and 2010/11,         The new method,         implemented by Trevor, proved to be practicable and had the added         advantage that the resulting         estimates of need included "confidence intervals" for different sized         populations.'
