     4.1 Contribution towards improving FTG's (employees, agents,         partners and subsidiaries) understanding of the regulatory environment         relating to mobile money in Jordan, Egypt, the Ivory Coast, the United         Kingdom, the United States and internationally     As a result of the research and advice provided to FTG, they were able to       expand, cultivate, promote and explore new business opportunities in       Jordan, Egypt and the Ivory Coast.
FTG realised a competitive advantage       with considerable expert knowledge (in the area of banking regulation and       AML) when negotiating with telecoms operators in those three       jurisdictions, providing a superior negotiating position and strategic       competitive advantage.
Therefore, the research contributed towards       improving FTG's (employees, agents, partners and subsidiaries)       understanding of the regulatory environment relating to mobile money in       Jordan, Egypt, and the Ivory Coast, and of the applicability of United       Kingdom, United States and international banking regulation in this field.
The combination of factors that led to FTG winning contracts in excess of       &#8364;5m included the strong international brand of FTG, the expertise within       the bidding team (that included representation from the FTG's Fraud and       Revenue Assurance team which had commissioned the research from the UWE       team), and the assurance of AML compliance which had been provided by the       commissioned research.
The exact value and details of these contracts cannot be disclosed due to       a strict confidentiality agreement to which UWE were party.
However, the       fact that the UWE research team were chosen to conduct two specific pieces       of work, worth in excess of &#8364;50,000, is evidence that FTG saw considerable       value in the engagement.
The former Knowledge Management Director with the       France Telecom Group, has commented that whilst the financial impact of       the research is `impossible to precisely define', `France Telecom realised       a considerable competitive advantage with expert knowledge when       negotiating with telecom operators in the [relevant] territories' [see       5.1]     4.2 Improving awareness of compliance obligations as they         relate to mobile money applications     The research project informed FTG of all of the risks associated with       money laundering and banking operations in Jordan, Egypt and the Ivory       Coast.
This contributed to the realisation of the following further       benefits:     4.2.1 FTG were able to launch new Mobile Money services in       Tunisia, Niger, Armenia and Uganda     4.2.2 FTG were able to continue to manage and limit the threat       posed by, and the associated financial costs of, fraud and revenue       assurance within acceptable levels (this figure is approximately between       0.5-3 per cent of revenues, but cannot be disclosed precisely because of       the confidentiality agreement) by focusing their operational efforts on       fraud and leakage items causing repeated costs.
Examples include call       reselling, roaming fraud, telesales fraud, subscription fraud, SAC related       fraud costs, and leakage resulting from change management (including       governance of fraud risk acceptance).
In particular, the findings and       conclusions of the research conducted by Ryder and Turksen resulted in FTG       identifying low levels of fraud compliance under obligations imposed by       the then Financial Services Authority under its Senior         Management Arrangements, Systems and Controls (SYSC) Handbook     4.2.3 the UWE findings assisted the FTG to achieve these important       goals by not only identifying the relevant banking, AML and fraud       regulations that they were required to comply with, but also by advising       them regarding best practice     4.2.4 industry standards usually quote fraud and revenue leakage       as affecting between 5- 15 per cent of revenue, depending on geographical       location.
As a result of the research conducted by Ryder and Turksen the       FTG were able to continue to maintain their very low level of fraud and       leakage.
This was beneficial to the FTG as it enabled them not only to       fully comply with the relevant banking, AML and fraud regulations, but by       also give them a superior competitive advantage, supported by the       provision of expert legal knowledge transfer.
As the then Knowledge       Management Director, Group Fraud and Revenue Assurance, France Telecom       Group, has attested, `The impact and benefit [derived from the work] was       that France Telecom realised a considerable competitive advantage with       expert knowledge when negotiating with telecom operators in the named       territories providing a superior negotiating position and strategic       competitive advantage'     The former Head of Global Development for Orange has said of the research       that it `made a significant contribution to the international success of       France Telecom/Orange, not least by improving understanding of the       regulatory environment relating to mobile money applications in a range of       countries, and improving awareness of compliance obligations as they       related to mobile money' [see 5.2]     4.3 Providing a foundation for FTG anti-fraud policy     The research findings were utilised by the FTG to form part of its       counter-fraud strategy documentation.
They were adopted by FTG and       circulated to its agents, partners, subsidiaries and overseas offices.
The       Managing Director of Newlands Horizons (UK) Ltd., has stated that `knowing       the conservative nature of [FTG's] Fraud and Revenues reporting, we can       assume that loss has been well controlled and to well below industry       standards due in the main to the comprehensive nature of [the UWE]       research....'
