     Policy and Legislative change     Professor Burman's body of research has contributed to policy       documentation on the investigation       and prosecution of rape and sexual offences produced by the Scottish       Government and Scotland's       prosecution service, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service       (COPFS).
It also contributed       to a series of changes in rape law and the law of evidence relating to       sexual offences, the Sexual       Offences (Procedure and Evidence) (Scotland) Act 2002 and the Sexual       Offences (Scotland) Act       2009, which remain in force today.
As with all legislative change, the       process has been a       cumulative and complex one, but through research-based publications, key       note addresses, expert       testimony and substantial involvement in the consultative processes,       Burman's research has had a       significant impact on the law and criminal justice policy on rape and       sexual offences in Scotland.
Under the 2009 legislation, the National Sexual Crimes Unit statistics       (December 2011) indicated       an initial rise in the conviction rate of concluded prosecutions to 62%       for rape.
With a statistic of       33% from Rape Crisis Scotland in December 2010, this demonstrated the new       legislation has       almost doubled the rate of conviction for those cases of rape brought to       court.
Lord Advocate       Frank Mulholland stated that `the new Sexual Offences Act brought         about significant changes in         the prosecution of sexual crime in Scotland'.
Findings from the first Scottish study on `rape shield' legislation were       published in 1993, amending       existing legislation in 1995 and ultimately informing the Sexual Offences       (Procedure and Evidence)       (Scotland) Act 2002.
The research was cited in a House of Lords Appeal       judgment, and went on to       underpin the Scottish Government consultation document Redressing the         Balance: Cross-Examination in Rape and Sexual Offence Trials.
The second and third `rape shield' studies       informed the COPFS Review of Investigation and Prosecution of Sexual         Offences in Scotland       (2006) and the Scottish Investigators' Guide to         Serious Sexual Offences.
This research also       formed the basis of advice to the Scottish Law       Commission's Review of Law on Rape and the       Scottish Justice Committee consultation which led       in turn to the development of the Sexual Offences       (Scotland) Act 2009.
A campaign from Rape Crisis Scotland (2008) was       directly influenced by Burman's research evaluating       the impact of sexual history and character evidence       in sexual offence trials.
The promotional postcard       from this campaign       asks `Who's really on trial?'
and       continues to feature on the Rape Crisis Scotland website.
Rape Crisis       Scotland says, 'Professor         Burman's research into rape shield legislation has been very valuable in         informing Rape Crisis         Scotland campaigning against the use of sexual history and character         evidence in rape trials, and         in providing both statistical data and anecdotal evidence of the         damaging impact this can have on         rape complainers and their chances of obtaining justice.'
Burman's research and testimony to the Justice Committee on the Scottish       Parliament's proposed       Sexual Offences Scotland Bill (18 November 2008) contributed to the 2009       Act.
It also influenced       the definition of consent in law as `free agreement' and the requirement       for the defence to provide       evidence of having sought consent.
Burman's research showed that consent       and the credibility of       the complainer are at the heart of most rape cases, and the need to prove       non-consent often leads       to arduous cross-examination of the complainer, and questioning on her       sexual history and       character, which rape shield legislation often fails to restrict.
Under       the 2009 Act, the accused must       now demonstrate that they took steps to establish consent, rather than the       focus on the victim to       demonstrate non-consent.
Ultimately, this aims to reduce secondary       victimisation, and encourage       victims to come forward to report, thus addressing a long-term policy       concern about under-reporting of rape.
Informing policy and practitioner debate     Professor Burman's research has led to numerous invitations to address       and engage with a wide       range of academic and professional conferences and consultative sessions       for those involved in       the formulation and implementation of policy in this area, including       lawyers, policy officials and third       sector organisations.
This has included: a keynote address to the Rape       Crisis Conference (2008);       an invited address (with Derek Ogg QC, then Head of the Crown Office       National Sexual Crimes       Unit) at the Association of Criminal Justice and Development Annual       Conference (Dublin, October       2009); participation in an intersectoral round table considering the scope       of the Gender Equality       Duty for informing criminal justice responses to violence against women       for the Equality and       Human Rights Commission (Glasgow 2009); a plenary address to the Annual       Conference on       Sexual Crime hosted by the COPFS (2009) on rape attrition; a presentation       for the Europe-wide       comparative event organised under the auspices of the Daphne 11 Programme,       in Athens,       Greece; and a keynote address on rape law reform in Scotland to the       intersectoral workshop on       Re-thinking Responses to Rape (2011).
Her body of research has also led to further commissioned work, such as       Burman acting as       Academic Reviewer for Baroness Vivien Stern's (2009) Review of         Criminal Justice Responses to         Rape and Sexual Assault in England and Wales, and membership of a       specialist advisory group       for the EHRC-funded project Map of Needs, which mapped violence against       women support       services in the UK in 2009.
Throughout 2013, Burman has been providing       consultation and advice,       and (with colleagues) commissioned by the Scottish Government to provide       an international       literature review of best practice interventions in gender-based violence       to inform Scotland's cross-government strategy on violence against women.
Shaping practitioner training     Burman's research has informed considerable discussion among       practitioners, challenging existing       understanding and helping to build consensus on the need for specific       changes in practice and       legislation.
On the basis of her research, Burman was invited (2004) by       the Judicial Studies       Committee to provide judicial training to the Scottish judiciary on sexual       offences and, in particular       the law of evidence in relation to sexual offences.
This continued on an       annual basis and in 2010,       culminated in her participation in an innovative training DVD, shot in the       High Court and produced       by the Judicial Studies Committee (now the Judicial Institute) (Judicial         Skills: Sexual Offences and         Expert Evidence, March 2010).
The DVD was initially used as part of       a training module developed       by the Director of the Judicial Institute for Scotland as a direct result       of Burman's `rape shield'       research.
This bespoke training module was delivered to 35 High Court       Judges in June 2010       incuding the Lord Justice General and Lord Justice Clerk.
The training       also included a number of       Canadian judges in conjunction with international judicial training       partner, the National Judicial       Institute of Canada.
The Director of the Judicial Institute for Scotland       stated; `I was very pleased         with the module which explores the rationale behind the need for rape         shield legislation...
The         module also raises awareness among the judges of your [Burman's]         research and various         criticisms that you [Burman] make in relation to the operation of the         shield.
It also gave the judges         an opportunity to discuss with Canadian Judges how equivalent         legislation operates in         Canada...the DVD was and remains an extrememly valuable training tool         which has much life still         left in it'.
This DVD is now regularly used for the induction of       Scottish and Canadian High Court       Judges and Sheriffs.
