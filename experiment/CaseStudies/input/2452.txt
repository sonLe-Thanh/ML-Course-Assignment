     Immediately following its publication in scientific journals, Wardlaw and       colleagues' work was highlighted in many secondary commentaries by highly       respected organisations that disseminate medical practice information; for       example, the American College of Physicians Journal Club publications and,       in the UK, the Database of Reviews of Effectiveness.
The work was also       included in a best-selling international textbook on stroke management       [5.1].
Impact on public policy       The findings were cited by and led to changes to the guidelines on stroke       management in the UK and internationally.
The National Institute for       Health and Care Excellence guidelines [5.2], European [5.3], Canadian       [5.4], Australasian [5.5] and the American Heart Association [5.6]       guidelines were changed in 2008 or subsequently.
Wardlaw's recent survey       of UK practice [3.6] revealed that intra-arterial angiography has been       replaced rapidly and completely by non-invasive imaging.
Data from 2012       (see below) clearly indicate that, as a result of Wardlaw's research and       these guidelines, a change in practice has occurred.
Wardlaw, with Chappell (CSO Health Services Research Fellow, UoE,       2002-present), Brazelli (CSO Health Services Research Fellows, UoE,       2010-2012) and Sandercock (UoE 1987-present; Professor of Medical       Neurology; Head of Cochrane Stroke Group) were foundation members of the       Cochrane Collaboration Diagnostic Tests Working Group, which is now       publishing key systematic reviews of the accuracy of diagnostic tests       [5.7], and important improvements in methodology.
These increasingly       underpin evidence on which tests should be used in clinical practice,       particularly in the era of stratified medicine.
Impact on practitioners and services       A survey of UK stroke services by Wardlaw, published in 2008, showed that       fewer patients were waiting more than 24 hours for CT brain imaging       compared with a survey in 2000-2001 [5.8].
Wardlaw's Health Technology       Assessment panel-commissioned survey of all stroke prevention services in       the UK in 2012 [3.6] showed that no centres were using intra-arterial       angiography, and 90%+ were using ultrasound, most on the day of referral,       and had immediate access to CT brain imaging for stroke.
Impact on health and the economy       Performing immediate brain imaging in all patients with suspected acute       stroke, compared with the less-effective strategies, for the 120,000       patients who have a stroke each year in the UK is calculated to have       resulted in 6,000 more quality-adjusted life-years, and reduced the cost       of stroke by between &#163;156M and &#163;312M per year in NHS costs.
Rapid non-invasive carotid imaging in patients with TIA, compared with       the slow and more invasive carotid imaging methods, is calculated to have       prevented about 1760 strokes per year in the UK and saved the NHS around       &#163;30M per year [3.5, 3.6].
