     `Working on the business, not in the business':     The LEAD programme has sought to go beyond the usual management offerings       to business and to develop skills and abilities based on research       observation relating to reflective and experiential learning.
The       programme involves engaging participants not only with tutors, but also       with each other in peer-to-peer learning groups.
These networks persist       after the ten-month LEAD programme and are encouraged through continuing       participation in GOLD       (which focuses on strategic development) and the Lancaster         Forum.
The involvement of key personnel in running and researching       LEAD has maintained the link between research and practice, whilst also       ensuring that the programme continues to meet participant needs.
Around       40% of participants on the subsequent North West LEAD programme were       introduced to it by past participants (Wren and Jones 2012).
IEED continues to conduct longitudinal research into the impact of LEAD       on both company performance (financial, innovation, procedural, strategic)       and the business trajectories of participating entrepreneurs.
The former       Director of LEAD, Susan Smith, appeared on BBC Radio 4 (the Today       programme and The World Tonight) and on BBC Television, August 2009, to       discuss how the economic situation was affecting access to finance for       small businesses.
The LEAD pilot featured in a number of national       newspapers such as The         Financial Times.
In autumn 2010 LEAD was highlighted in the MacLeod       Review of Employee Engagement as an exemplar of good practice in       supporting SMEs.
In March 2013, the LEAD programme was referenced several       times in the House of Lords Select Committee Report `Roads to Success: SME       Exports'.
The North West LEAD programme:     Following the success of the pilot programme and the established contact       base IEED had with businesses in Cumbria and Lancashire, the NWDA       earmarked approximately &#163;12m in 2007 for a North West England roll-out of       the LEAD programme.
This took place from 2009 to 2011 with IEED leading a       partnership of 13 providers, who have to date delivered LEAD to over 1250       SMEs.
External evaluation reports (Wren and Jones, 2006; Wren and Jones,       2012) of LEAD North West were presented to government, under the promotion       of the NWDA, the lead body on the theme of Leadership and Management (out       of nine English Regional Development Agencies).
The report findings       included (Wren and Jones: 2-3):     Business outcomes:            Across all businesses, the mean annual increase in sales was &#163;105,000,         a growth rate of 3.5% a year and, for those experiencing an increase in         turnover, the mean sales increase was about &#163;360,000 a year, of which         &#163;135,000 (37.5%) is attributable to LEAD.
Around half of survey respondents report an increase in employment.
Across all businesses, the annual growth rate in jobs due to LEAD is         3.6%.
Three-quarters of participants' annual labour productivity improved by         &#163;8,800 (average).
LEAD participants added about &#163;11m in net sales per annum in 2004-11,         of which about &#163;7.5m a year is attributable to LEAD, adding 300 jobs to         the region.
Leadership and intermediate effects:            Virtually every participant said that LEAD had developed their         leadership.
A third of participants indicated that LEAD improved their confidence,         reinforced existing beliefs and provided a better understanding of         leadership and new skills/ frameworks       Many participants have undertaken a change in their business structure         following LEAD.
Virtually all participants have undertaken changes in management, with         over half indicating that they had appointed a business manager since         joining LEAD.
Expansion of the LEAD programme &#8212; nationally and internationally:     The success of the LEAD programme in the North West has resulted in 3       further programmes in the UK.
LEAD         Wales is a six-year programme (launched in July 2009) to deliver       LEAD to 700 Welsh SMEs.
The Welsh Assembly Government allocated &#163;5m of       European Social Fund money towards the &#163;8m project.
The IEED LEAD team is       supporting Swansea University in that programme.
LEAD         South West is led by Quolux, in association with IEED and LEAD       London is due to launch in November 2013.
Members of the IEED LEAD team have recently consulted with organisations       in the UK and overseas wanting to develop SME leadership programmes or to       deliver LEAD in their own territory.
Smith consulted with the Australian       government in the development of a National Australian Leadership       programme, which was informed by LEAD and its research insights.
As a result of this research, the LEAD team was approached in June 2013       by the Cabinet Office to develop a &#163;32m Regional Growth Fund (RGF) bid to       support a growth agenda in 20 cities and their wider areas across England.
The government has made a conditional offer to Lancaster University (under       the Wave 2 City Deals Growth Hub).
The Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg,       who announced the successful participants in the initiative, stated that,       "The different projects and programmes from this round will leverage         &#163;2.8 billion of additional private sector investment and create or         safeguard 77,000 jobs."
