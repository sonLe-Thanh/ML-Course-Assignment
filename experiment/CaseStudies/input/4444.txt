     The impact of this research has been substantive changes in research and       innovation policy at the UK Research Councils (notably EPSRC),Technology       Strategy Board and European Commission.
It has also had impact in key       funding and management decisions by these bodies relating to three areas       of emerging techno-science and innovation: nanotechnology, synthetic       biology and climate (geo) engineering.
The initial impact of the research was at an EPSRC level.
Drawing on his       experience in establishing and then leading an international science into       policy programme in the area of nanotechnologies by NERC and EPSRC, Prof       Owen was asked to scope the RCUK `Nanotechnologies for the Environment'       funding call on carbon capture innovation (2009).
Prof Owen was granted       approval to research, trial and embed some of his early ideas on       responsible innovation: this was the first time this had been attempted at       EPSRC and the first formal occasion in which researchers applying to EPSRC       were asked to reflect on the wider impacts and implications of their       research.
He introduced a new responsible innovation funding approach in       which applicants to the call were required to identify any societal,       environmental or other impacts, or ethical concerns associated with their       proposed research, qualitatively provide an appraisal of risk, and       identify responsibilities for managing these risks.
Prof Owen worked with       EPSRC to develop the peer review and funding panel evaluation procedures       for this novel process (see Owen and Goldberg, 2010).This pilot work was       an important location to develop the initial framing of the concept and       insights into the opportunities and challenges of implementation.
Working with the EPSRC's Societal Issues Panel and Executive, and funded       by ESRC and EPSRC, Prof Owen developed the thinking further throughout       2010 and 2011, working closely with EPSRC and ESRC in a co-production mode       to develop several key dimensions of responsible innovation (see above).
This culminated in a paper to EPSRC Council in October 2012.
These       dimensions evolved into the development of a generic RI framework and led       to a commitment by EPSRC to responsible innovation within its Delivery       Plan.
It was at this time that EPSRC took ownership of the RI concept,       first within their Strategy team.
The recommendations of Prof Owen, as       noted by the EPSRC CEO for Strategy and Planning, `had a direct           impact and was an integral factor in assisting the advisory group to           shape specific recommendations for implementing a responsible           innovation approach'(1).
The RI agenda was further       developed at EPSRC where, in conjunction with the Director of Impact, Prof       Owen led the case for responsible innovation through the strategic       advisory structures and Council, `to develop a responsible           innovation framework for implementation across the research council'       (1).
The recommendations were formally approved in November 2012 (6)       and EPSRC committed fully to RI as a key part of research policy published       in September 2013 (6).
In early 2011 the work took on greater significance when Prof Owen was       asked by EPSRC, NERC and STFC to use the evolving RI framework to guide       decisions concerning the first cross council climate engineering project,       underpinning this with a responsible innovation approach.
He was asked to       develop several responsible innovation criteria, which were used by RCUK       to support a decision on the undertaking of the first climate engineering       field under the SPICE (Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate       Engineering) project; `the adoption of the framework ensured a very           careful and thoughtful consideration of potential public perception by           the research team'(2); it was critical for EPSRC as the       major funder that they proceed, and be seen to proceed, in a responsible       manner.
This was an important case study to put the conceptual thinking       into action: Prof Owen led on embedding the responsible innovation       dimensions within an innovation stage gating process drawn from business       studies to serve as a governance mechanism, which was used in a pivotal       `stage gate review' panel convened by RCUK with the SPICE team in June       2011.
This challenging case study demonstrated the impact and value of the       responsible innovation concept in a real world situation `..after           consultation with stakeholders.....the SPICE project team decided not           to carry out an experimental component of their project.
This decision           was made in part as a response to their reviews carried out under the           responsible innovation framework'(2).
This project       culminated in a publication in Nature that received considerable media       attention in the national press (e.g.
The Guardian), and extended       interviews as part of the BBC programme `Material World' and the Canadian       Broadcasting Company's flagship current affairs programme `The Current'.
In October 2012 the impact of the RI framework extended beyond the       research councils to the Technology Strategy Board and Nuffield Council       for Bioethics.
The TSB lead for Synthetic Biology states `the           Responsible Innovation framework has been very valuable in helping           shape the thinking within Technology Strategy Board as we evolve our           position and expectations of project partners to demonstrate they are           undertaking responsible practice' (3).
The framework       was used as a key input into the drafting of the UK Synthetic Biology       Roadmap (4) and `within the business-led Synthetic Biology           Industrial Feasibility competition (2012) and EPSRC-BBSRC-TSB           Innovation and Knowledge Centre (2013)......responsible innovation was           an important underpinning theme and a key criterion for funding'       (3).
These included specific responsible innovation criteria       evaluated by a multi-disciplinary `responsible innovation framework panel'       on which Prof Owen sat.
The international impact of the work began in March 2011, when Prof Owen       was invited to attend an expert group meeting at DG Research, European       Commission, to frame and scope a Responsible Research and Innovation       policy initiative.
The policy lead for the EC DG Research &amp; Innovation       notes `the responsible innovation framework developed by Prof Owen           and colleagues has been an important input in terms of the           intellectual thinking behind and framing of RRI and has had           significant impact at an EU research and innovation policy level in           this regard'(5).
This initial meeting was followed by a       major international workshop on responsible innovation at the French       Embassy in London in May 2011 organised by Prof Owen in which the EC       announced its intention to commit to the responsible innovation concept       under its forthcoming Horizon 2020 and Innovation Union Strategies (see       Owen et al, 2012 above).
A series of knowledge transfer activities       (workshops, seminars, training) then followed with international research       councils, including the Norwegian Research Council in November 2011 and US       National Science Foundation in 2012, in part funded by the Foreign and       Commonwealth Office.
The EU Commissioner for Research and Innovation made       a formal policy announcement to reconfigure the European Research Area       underpinned by the concept of `Responsible Innovation' in May 2013,       placing the responsible innovation concept at the centre of science and       innovation policy in Europe.
The significance of this for EC policy is       noted; `Prof Owen's research has been an important contribution to           the development of RRI in terms of both concept and practice, and this           has had significant impact in terms of the formulation and development           of emerging research and innovation policy at an EU level' (5).
