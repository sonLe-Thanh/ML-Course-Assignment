     The impacts of this research are that (i) it underpins and is essentially       embodied in modern guidelines on the design of avalanche defence barriers;       (ii) it has been used extensively by specialists across Europe who design       barriers and has played a crucial part in securing very significant       investment in infrastructure through large-scale civil engineering       projects aimed at reducing the risk of avalanche damage to settlements;       and (iii) the research findings form the basis of highly regarded training       courses for avalanche professionals.
Guidelines on design     The research findings on the interaction between obstacles and avalanches       and their implications for the design of defence barriers ([1]-[4]) have       been disseminated in a series of reports written by professional avalanche       researchers that provide practical guidance for avalanche engineers and       other users.
The following two reports are particularly significant:     Background for the determination of dam height in the SATSIE dam         design guidelines (Icelandic Met Office, March 2008) [a]       The design of avalanche protection dams.
Recent practical and         theoretical developments (European Commission, 2009) [b]     These publications (particularly [b], which is the more comprehensive)       are specifically targeted at engineers tasked with designing new       structures and they contain many practical guidelines.
In [b], research       conducted by Hogg and H&#225;konard&#243;ttir forms the basis for Chapter 5       (`Deflecting and catching dams') and Chapter 9 (`Braking mounds').
Additionally, parts of Chapter 6 (`Special considerations for deflecting       dams') and Appendix D (`Integrated protective measures &#8212; a practical       example') feature several ideas developed by Hogg and H&#225;konard&#243;ttir.
This       handbook has been reviewed in journals, whose core audience includes civil       engineers who design avalanche defences in the public and private sectors       internationally.
For example, Jomelli concludes that the handbook       "represents a useful addition to the technical literature and a good       reading opportunity for scientists, engineers and practitioners" [c],       while Ancey observes that "Trained engineers and practitioners will find       useful information on recent developments concerning avalanche-catching       dams" [d].
The scientific guidelines [3,4,b] are also reported in Handbuch         Technischer Lawinenschutz (2011)[e], a thorough reference book about       snow avalanche safety and the design of snow avalanche protection       measures, including supporting structures and dams[h].
This is published       in German, edited by avalanche professionals from the Austrian Service for       Torrent and Avalanche Control [e]; an English version is planned.
The book       has been well received in the engineering community.
Wolfgang Fellin       writes that "...the handbook...should become a basic reference for all       those involved in avalanche protection and alpine civil engineering" [f].
The guidelines also feature in recently adopted Austrian technical       guidelines ONR 24806:2011-12-15: Permanent technical avalanche         protection: Design of structures, while the new methodology for       computing granular shocks [4] has been implemented in software       (`WLV-DammTool') and this tool is now used by avalanche professionals       across Europe [g].
Investment in infrastructure     The research results [1]-[4], embodied in the new guidelines [b], have       been employed at a range of locations in Iceland, thus reducing the risks       for villages and other settlements [h].
The economic cost of avalanche       damage in Iceland between 1974 and 2000 is estimated at &#163;16M, while there       were 69 fatalities.
The new avalanche protection measures are intended to       avoid such losses [h].
The six projects that have been completed in       Iceland since 2008 using the research findings [1]-[4] and new guidelines       [b] are at B&#237;ldudalur (&#8364;1.9 M), &#211;lafsv&#237;k (&#8364;2.3 M), &#211;lafsfj&#246;r&#240;ur (&#8364;1.6 M),       Bolungarv&#237;k (&#8364;9.3 M), Neskaupsta&#240;ur 1 (&#8364;6.2 M) and Neskaupsta&#240;ur 2 (&#8364;10.1       M).
(The figures in parentheses are the infrastructure costs of the       projects [h].)
Currently there are seven projects under construction or in       the later stages of design.
These are at Patreksfj&#246;r&#240;ur (two projects),       B&#237;ldudalur, &#205;safj&#246;r&#240;ur (two projects), Siglufj&#246;r&#240;ur and Eskifj&#246;r&#240;ur.
Overall, the Icelandic government is spending &#8364;5.1M per year on avalanche       defence and this level of spending will continue until at least 2020, by       which time it is envisaged that most endangered settlements will have been       protected [h].
It is assessed that the installation of these various       avalanche defence measures significantly reduces the risk of damage to       settlements in potential avalanche tracks.
For instance, the chief       avalanche scientist at the Icelandic Meterological Office writes, "We       might guestimate that the risk is in many cases reduced by an order of       magnitude...." [h].
The research [1]-[4] and new guidelines [b] also form the basis of the       design of a number of defence structures in Norway, with the design work       carried out by avalanche engineers at the Norwegian Geophysical Institute       [i].
The projects include the dimensioning and design of a deflection dam       protecting a power station at Rolandsfjorden in the municipality of Mel&#248;y,       Nordland county, which was completed in 2011; and the dimensioning and       design of protection dams at R&#248;mmingslia, municipality of Oppdal, Oppland       county, and for Hotel Alexandria, Loen, municipality of Stryn, Sogn og       Fjordane county, and a transformer station in the municipality of       H&#248;yanger, Sogn og Fjordane county.
In addition, design works are being       carried out to safeguard buildings at Kobbelv hydroelectric power station,       municipality of S&#248;rfold, Nordland county, and exposed masts of       high-voltage power line through avalanche-prone terrain in the       municipalities of Naustdal, H&#248;yanger and Sogndal, Sogn og Fjordane county.
The cost of such works is approximately &#163;2-3M, but the value of the       infrastructure they protect is dramatically higher (at least &#163;100M) [i].
The guidelines for the design of avalanche defence structures [b] have       also been adopted by alpine European countries.
In France, extensive       measures are being constructed at Chamonix to defend against avalanches       originating from the Taconnaz glacier.
This installation includes mounds       and deflecting and catching dams.
The investment is approximately &#8364;10M and       the design, which relies on the research results of Hogg and H&#225;konard&#243;ttir       [1]-[4] , was carried out by IRSTEA (French National Research Institute of       Science and Technology for Environment and Agriculture)[j].
Researchers       from the institute also designed the deflecting dam on the Fougeret       avalanche track at Cialancier (Saint-Etienne de la Tinee) in collaboration       with RTM ('Restauration des Terrains de Montagne', France)[j], using the       research findings [1]-[4] and the new guidelines [b].
The guidelines have       also been used in Switzerland by the Institute for Snow and Avalanche       Research (SLF) and in Austria, where the Austrian Service for Torrent and       Avalanche Control are charged with the responsibility for assessing and       managing the risk from avalanches.
In the latter case, they have       constructed a deflection and a catching dam at Tuiflahn (&#8364;1.5M), based on       [1]-[4] and [b], which provides protection for 34 dwellings in the most       hazardous zones and there are advanced plans for protection measures at       Dalfaz to defend 26 buildings with an estimated infrastructure cost of       &#8364;1.1M [g].
Training     Various training courses for avalanche engineers have drawn heavily on       the new approach to modelling the interactions between obstacles and       avalanches developed by Hogg and H&#225;konard&#243;ttir [1]-[4].
These include a       two-day course in 2012 for professional engineers from RTM; a half-day       course in 2009 for professional engineers from DDT ('Direction       d&#233;partementale des Territoires', Haute-Savoie, France); and contributions       to a week-long course in 2010 for engineers from the public and private       sectors in France, Italy and Spain under the framework of the European       Summer School on Avalanches (Les Deux Alpes, France) [j].
Finally, the       research conducted at Bristol has provided in depth training for       H&#225;konard&#243;ttir.
She subsequently became one of the leading technical       engineers on avalanche protection schemes at VST Consulting Engineers,       Reykjavik, Iceland.
