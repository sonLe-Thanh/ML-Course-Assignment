     This research clearly identified two key features of farm diversification       for the first time: that       women were important contributors to diversification of enterprises on       farms and to the survival       of farm businesses; that these diversified enterprises were being held       back by significant       barriers.
The research showed that key barriers were inadequate access to       finance and lack of       business support and mentoring.
As a direct outcome of this research, the       WiRE programme       was established by the lead researcher, Dr Izzy Warren-Smith with a       variety of funding sources       between 2001 and 2011.
The funding was used to develop a range of       services, including       training, workshops and conferences, to help rural women start, develop       and grow their       businesses and aimed to directly assist innovation and growth through       enabling these       microbusinesses to associate with each other.
The funding enabled the       research to continue       through an iterative process using the WiRE members as subjects (action       research).
WiRE membership currently (November 2012) stands at c. 6,000, including       700 who pay for       additional services.
There are 60 volunteer network leaders across the       country organising local       meetings for some 1,800 business women each month.
The following examples       from 2010 data       give a measure of the scale of the economic impact of WiRE over the last       10 years: 2010       turnover data from 334 of the 1,300 subscribing WiRE business members       indicates that they       generate in direct income for the rural economy and farming nearly &#163;35.3m       annually.
During       2010 WiRE trained 117 start-ups within the West Midlands with a cumulative       projected turnover,       within two years, of &#163;1m.
Recognition of the impact of this research is shown by the following:            WiRE has been cited as an exemplar in the UK Government's Strategic         Framework for         Women's Enterprise       A Case-study of WiRE was included in the Stairways to Growth report on         women in         business by the National Association for the Promotion of Women's         Enterprise (Prowess).
Dr Izzy Warren-Smith was awarded the OBE in 2005 for services to         female         entrepreneurship.
Harper Adams was awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize in 2005, in         recognition of the         contribution that WiRE has made to supporting women-owned rural         businesses.
In January 2013 Polly Gibb, the current WiRE Director, was awarded the         OBE for services         to rural enterprise.
