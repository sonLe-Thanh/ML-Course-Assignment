     The research findings resulted in the founding of the clean-tech company,       Xeros Ltd., in 2007.
The company's first premises were in Leeds University       Business Incubator, with two staff; the company moved to its current       location (Advanced Manufacturing Park, Rotherham, South Yorkshire) in 2010       and now employs 27 staff (most of whom are science PhD graduates) housed       within a purpose-built R&amp;D/manufacturing facility.
Details of impact       are given by Xeros Ltd in the attached letter [A].
The research findings that the patented polymer particle technology       enables clothes to be cleaned using a fraction of the water, energy and       detergent required for conventional cleaning methods, and provides       significant cost-saving and environmental benefits, were borne out by       results secured from a series of highly successful field trials in 2011.
These trials were undertaken at two of the UK's most respected launderers       and cleaners namely, Jeeves of Belgravia, which specialises in       bespoke garment care and Watford Launderers and Cleaners, one of       the UK's largest independent commercial laundry operators.
The field       trials showed that the Xeros polymer particle washing system delivered       superior cleaning performance to conventional commercial washing systems,       as well as significantly reducing energy, detergent and water consumption       [B].
Xeros has been successful in raising investment, despite the on-going       global financial difficulties, with the most recent round in 2013 bringing       the total investment thus far generated to &#163;16m.
In February 2012, Xeros       was awarded a &#163;250,000 grant for R&amp;D development by the Technology       Strategy Board to accelerate the development of a domestic laundry       machine.
Xeros received a further grant of &#163;75,000 from the Technology       Strategy Board to create a novel way of cleaning leather that will both       save water and protect the environment by reducing the polluting toxins in       the industry's waste water [C].
The initial focus of Xeros' business model has been the construction of a       commercial-scale laundry machine capable of washing up to 25kg of clothes       at a time, aimed at the commercial cleaning sector, such as hotels,       hospitals and high street cleaners, for launch in 2012.
The recent       installation of its commercial-scale washing machine at a major US       commercial launderer attracted the attention of the Yorkshire Post [D].
The company will introduce a domestic-scale machine in 2014 [E].
To optimise the polymer particle technology and prepare products for       market, Xeros has established a commercial partnership with the US company       GreenEarth Cleaning, the world's largest dry cleaning brand, which       operates in 42 countries with over 2000 licensed users of its       environmentally friendly patented dry cleaning process.
The President of GreenEarth         Cleaning commented that "We had the honour of previewing this       exciting new technology to many of our 800 U.S. dry cleaning affiliates       over the past two years.
We believe Xeros will be embraced by our industry       because of the significant cost savings and environmental benefits it       brings."
[F]     The concept of waterless washing has attracted considerable global media       interest, having been reported in publications ranging from The         Economist, The Times of India, Toronto Star, Business         Weekly, Gulf News, Physics Today and The Sunday         Times.
The invention featured on Radio 2's Drivetime show,       the BBC World Service and Channel 4's Home of the Future programme       (Feb 19th 2012) [G].
The technology was named as one of WWF's `Top 20 Global Green       Game-Changers' in 2010, voted 2nd in the top 50 `2010 Best         Inventions' by TIME Magazine and was awarded Best         Technological Breakthrough at the Climate Week Awards 2011.
In 2011,       Xeros was one of only 25 companies selected from a range of cleantech sub       sectors to present its technology at The European Cleantech Summit         2011 in Geneva [H].
The Deputy Prime Minister recently toured Xeros' facility in Rotherham,       during which he commented "It takes your breath away.
It is such a         simple idea, but it is so revolutionary" adding "It could save         billions and billions of litres of water over time.
The implications are         profound in terms of water and energy use."
In the context of the       impact of our research, The Deputy Prime Minister commented that "This         is a great example of what we want to see happening in the British         economy.
It was academics that first came up with the idea and it has         been translated, partly thanks to support from the government and         private investors, into something that hopefully make its way into the         shops fairly soon" [I].
In this context, as the novel,       polymer particle clothes washing system saves so much of the water       associated with conventional washing, if the US domestic washing market       converted to Xeros technology, some 1.2 billion tonnes of water per day       could be saved [J].
