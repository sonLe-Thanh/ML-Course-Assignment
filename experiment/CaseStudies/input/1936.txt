     ESPEC research has advanced policy makers' awareness and understanding of       climate driven       disease vectors, enhancing their capacity to manage risk.
Preventing       future harm that arises from       malaria is evidenced through the examples below:     Seasonal Scales     The practical value of seasonal Ensemble Predictions Systems (EPS) has       been recognised       by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), and the wider seasonal       forecasting community       especially in Africa, for its ability to `predict a probability       distribution of climate scenarios and       hence, peak times for malaria transmissions(1).
It has       generated interest in the use of EPS at       organisations such as ACMAD (African Centre of Meteorological         Applications for Development).
Another impact of AMMA, and ongoing QWeCI and Healthy Futures EC Framework       6 and 7       projects is the development and consolidation of scientific capacity in       the region.
This led to better       integration of regional decision makers and scientists in order to       demonstrate the benefits, and       ultimately the adoption of decision support tools such as LMM to `lead to       an outstanding impact to       the policies' (2).
The usefulness of such systems enhanced       interaction between climate scientists       and humanitarian NGOs via the Humanitarian Futures Programme (HFP),       including Christian Aid       where Morse "provided general guidance and advice to the NGOs ...on         issues related to climate         change and livelihoods" (3) in developing and using the       products that are derived from the       forecasting systems; this now forms UK government thinking for future       development (4).
Multi-decadal Scales     LMM has been verified at seasonal scale prediction allowing use with       Regional Climate Models       (RCMs) for current climate and with RCM climate projections for Africa and       Europe.
It provides       useful insight to risks in the current climate.
Further diseases and       vectors have been investigated       with RCM runs for Europe most notably with interest from the NERC ENHanCE       project for Aedes         albopictus (Asian Tiger Mosquito) with the Health Protection Agency       saying that the work "is of         critical importance to policy and planning for the potential incursion         of this exotic mosquito into this         country" (5).
This work has been used to highlight       dengue risk if the mosquito became endemic to       parts of the UK as a result of climate change, "the further importance         of this work is that it helps         identify those parts of the UK where we should focus our ongoing         surveillance for this mosquito" (5)       and 7).
The Climate Services Agenda has come out of pioneering work as       illustrated here and has       shown societal value of integrated impacts modelling systems across       multiple sectors.
In a project       led by the Tanzania Meteorological Agency, its DG, Agnes Kijazi, stated       that weather forecasts can       make a huge difference for the l0-12 million malaria patients.
The main       objective of the project was       to further develop and apply DEMETER methodology of integrating seasonal       forecasts and malaria       statistics into an end-to-end early warning system for malaria outbreaks.
A new database of clinical       cases was collected and made available for the wider scientific community.
The seasonal cycle of       malaria outbreaks were determined and high risk areas identified (1).
This was highlighted in the       WMO World Climate Research Programme's Open Science Meeting on Climate       Research in       Service to Society in Denver, October 2011, and the       IGBP/DIVERSITAS/IHDP/WCRP and ESSP       Planet Under Pressure 2012 meeting, the largest gathering of global change       scientists leading up       to Rio+20 with 3,018 delegates at the venue and over 3,500 attending via       live webstreaming,       providing scientific leadership to Rio 20+ in London, 2012, where Morse       co-convened a session       and co-authored a briefing paper (6).
Our malaria modelling work was cited in the WHO Roll Back Malaria       Programme and its       Progress and Impact Series report on Mathematical Modelling to Support       Malaria Control and       Elimination (8).
The usefulness of a diagram we developed, in       the work above, illustrating our       malaria model performance over a series of years of seasonal forecasts is       noted in a report       Foresight: Infectious Diseases for the Department of Business, Innovation       and Skills, `but if more         long-term records of forecasts and outcomes such as this one were         available, decision makers         could learn and improve their decision over time.
In future, scientists         should routinely make         available the track record of their predictions, and decision makers         should insist on knowing the         past reliability of the forecast before relying on it.'
(9).
We have also worked on various training       workshops for decision makers, next generation scientists from Africa and       with African village       leaders and representatives "... undertaken in S&#233;n&#233;gal a workshop with         regional decision makers         and Ministry officials (the National Malaria Programme, National         Veterinary Services).
That         meeting was instrumental to convince those that a decision support tool         like LMM can be used         operationally in public health" (2).
In May 2013 the       first operational EPS malaria modelling systems       was developed using the LMM based operational seasonal forecasting `System       4' at The European       Centre for medium-Range Weather Forecasts (10).
