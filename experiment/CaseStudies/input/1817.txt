       The Bank of England engages with academia in order to explain current         policy issues and         learn about tools and models that may be useful for addressing them.
This engagement         process often leads to research projects involving both Bank staff and         external academics,         the results of which are described in internal publications such as the         Quarterly Bulletin.
These publications, in turn, inform decisions by policymakers at the         Bank.
Kapetanios was employed by the Bank prior to joining QMUL, and         continues to spend one         day a week there on a permanent basis, so he is well placed to         participate in the interchange         of ideas between academics and policymakers.
His research in         collaboration with staff at the         Bank has continued to influence both its operational practices and its         conduct of monetary         policy.
The examples of collaborative research described below         demonstrate this impact: in         all three cases, Kapetanios was personally involved in the production of         briefing notes         presented to the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to inform and support         its decision-making.
1.
Macroeconomic forecasting.
Since monetary policy is forward looking, a critical factor for its         effectiveness is the         availability of accurate macroeconomic forecasts.
This is especially so,         as in recent years, in         the aftermath of a severe recession.
Kapetanios's research has led to the development of a suite of novel         statistical models that         are routinely used by the Bank to construct forecasts of key indicators         such as GDP growth         and inflation for the Monetary Policy Committee.
These models exploit         data and methods not         previously included in the Bank of England Quarterly Model, the         institution's primary         framework for producing official economic projections.
For example, the         suite contains linear         and non-linear univariate models whose performance Kapetanios has         compared with official         forecasts (see reference #4 in Section 3 above).
2.
Uncertainty in data releases.
Most macroeconomic data are uncertain; that is, they are estimates         rather than perfect         measures of the economic variables of interest.
Quantifying and         correcting for this         uncertainty is of great importance for the conduct of monetary policy.
In 2005 Kapetanios was asked by the Bank of England to serve as the         lead econometrician         on a team assigned to study biases and other deficiencies in early ONS         releases, and to         propose methods for addressing these issues.
This research collaboration         has produced         innovative tools for understanding and using uncertain macroeconomic         data, including a         behavioural model of government statistical agencies and an analysis of         the trade-off         between accuracy and recentness of information (see references #2 and #5         in Section 3         above).
Bank staff who brief the Monetary Policy Committee regularly use         this data-uncertainty         toolkit to improve their forecasts of macroeconomic trends.
3.
Effects of quantitative easing.
After the financial crisis intensified in late 2008, the Bank of         England and other central banks         loosened monetary policy by both conventional and unconventional means.
In the UK, the         principal unconventional policy measure has been the so-called         "quantitative easing"         programme, which has made large-scale asset purchases financed by         central bank money.
Kapetanios has recently coordinated a Bank project aiming to quantify         the macroeconomic         effects of the QE programme.
A variety of vector autoregression models         indicate that the first         round of asset purchases had peak effects of approximately +1.5% on real         GDP and +1.25%         on CPI inflation.
These findings have provided the main source of         scientific support for the         effectiveness of the QE policy in the UK during the Great Recession.
