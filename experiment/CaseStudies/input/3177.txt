     Theatrum Mundi: Armarium is a highly successful collaborative       work, and is cited by scholars and       critics in making reference to wider cultural and art practice by both       Professor Williams and Dion.
It       is frequently invoked and included in publications that explore, for       example, the relationship       between art and science, cosmology, epistemology and taxonomy.
A limited       edition print made by       Dion and Williams for Galerie In-Situ, Paris, is also frequently       reproduced within both art-world       publications, and in academic analyses, and further helps to disseminate       the impact of the piece in       terms of critical discourse and audience reach.
The list of international       publications which feature       discussion of the installation provides a commentary or analysis of the       work.
This critical       positioning of the work within on-going cultural discourses focus on       themes of the relationship       between art and science, of collections and collecting, the construction       of epistemologies,       wunderkammer (historic and contemporary), collaborative art       practice and museum oriented       contemporary art work.
The widespread dissemination of the work as an       early example of a       modern use of a cabinet of curiosity as an artistic vehicle has influenced       the rediscovery of the       wunderkammer as a form for contemporary artworks.
Of particular note is the analysis found within Professor Lord Colin       Renfrew's influential book,       Figuring It Out (2003) which investigated the relationship between       archaeologists and artists as       practitioners and cultural researchers.
The inclusion of the work within       Umberto Eco's visual essay       in his book The Infinity of Lists (2009) is significant, not only       because of the epistemological nature       of that work, but also because it is `activated' by the engagement of the       viewer as part of the       process of interpretation.
After touring venues in the UK, France, and       Germany, Theatrum Mundi:         Armarium was selected and included in the seminal exhibition The         Luminous Interval, at the       Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao, in 2011.
The wider reach of the Guggenheim       Bilbao exhibition is       shown in the attendance figure of 532,287 visitors during the period, with       1250 Spanish and 2000       English hard back catalogues produced.
This was a large scale survey       exhibition of artwork from       the D.Daskalopoulos Collection, curated by Nancy Spector of the New York Solomon         R.         Guggenheim Museum, which sought to offer a new critical context for       the most significant       examples of international installation art from contemporary       practitioners.
This ground-breaking       exhibition was followed closely by the inclusion of the piece in the 2011       Athens Biennale, curated       by Nicholas Bourriaud, Xenia Kalpaktsolglou and Poka-Yio, which       articulated further issues in the       exploration of value, commodity, knowledge and power in the context of       relational aesthetics and       socially engaged practice.
A highly visible piece, Theatrum Mundi:         Armarium has an important       international reach, the most recent incarnation is within the 2013       exhibition The Macabre Treasury       at Museum Het Domein, Sittard, Holland.
The position of Theatrum Mundi as an important modern incarnation       of a wunderkammer is seen in       its inclusion in the Patrick Mauri&#233;s volume, Cabinets of Curiosity       (Thames &amp; Hudson, 2002).
This       book has extensive reach, with an initial printing run of over 16,000       copies in four languages, and a       number of additional print runs almost doubling this number, including a       Japanese edition.
Interest and engagement with the piece is shown by its inclusion on a       variety of websites, from       those interested in critical analyses, reviews and influences within the       contemporary art       community, and which reflect interdisciplinary discourses, to those       concerned with more academic       and scholarly issues, which seek to locate the work thematically within       the discourse tropes (such       as art historical or practitioner education contexts), and to blogs and       sharing sites of the general       public and developing artists, showing engagement with the alchemical,       collecting or cabinet of       curiosity and memento mori themes.
The importance of the work in understanding historical and psychological       issues around       engagement with and perception of the world through collection and       categorisation is also shown       through the selection of the piece by the Guggenheim for production of       accompanying educational       resources.
The teacher's guide includes questions and activities related       to the work, and are part       of a series aimed at enriching history and social science curricula, as       well as arts education.
Theatrum mundi was one of only three installations from the Luminous         Interval exhibition used as       an educational resource, which remains on the Guggenheim Bilbao website       alongside an image       of the work.
