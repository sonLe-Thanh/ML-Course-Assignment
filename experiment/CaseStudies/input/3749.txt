     The grants from ITI Techmedia specified that the arising IP portfolio was       to be owned and developed by them for the benefit of the Scottish economy.
This responsibility passed onto SE on their amalgamation.
M&#246;lnlycke Health       Care AB (a world leading manufacturer of wound care products and a major       service provider to the healthcare sector with annual sales which have       grown rapidly from &#163;536M in Q4 2007 to &#163;932M in 2012 of which ~40%       currently derives from its Wound Care Division) recognised the pressing       requirement for rapid and sensitive technologies suitable for PoC testing.
The opportunity for rapid detection of MRSA was verified by ZinC (a health       innovation, growth and market strategy consultancy) in 2008 "as part         of the Scottish Enterprise ITI Scotland Chronic Wound Care Programme.
Using our Health Opportunity Design&#174; methodology, ZinC uncovered a         $4.3bn global opportunity for chronic wound infection.
Prompt, MRSA         detection, at the point-of-care, was deemed the most prescient         opportunity in a product development roadmap, devised by ZinC, that         encompassed a series of increasingly complex technologies to target not         just MRSA but other critical bacterial infections, and to meet the         prioritized and precisely defined unmet needs of a global wound care         practitioner base.
[S1] In April 2012, the global PoC diagnostics       market was estimated to be in excess of $4.3B and was forecast to grow to       $7B by 2018, with infectious diseases being the most dynamic sector [S2,       S3].
M&#246;lnlycke Healthcare AB has ~7000 employees and manufacturing plants       in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Malaysia, Thailand,       Poland, the UK and the US.
A route to establishing a competitive presence       in the global diagnostics market was therefore a priority for M&#246;lnlycke.
Seeing the opportunity that the IP and associated UoE expertise       presented, M&#246;lnlycke Healthcare AB secured an exclusive license from SE in       2012 (details commercially confidential) and established a new subsidiary,       MHC Scotland Ltd in the BioQuarter in Edinburgh [S4], to develop this       technology for the diagnostics market.
The Head of Chemical Sciences at SE       has said "The Edinburgh University research team were key in delivering         a positive outcome from the programme due to their acknowledged         world-class capabilities in the field of small-scale surface detection         technologies in general and your [EaStCHEM] expertise in electrochemical         detection in particular.
This progress enabled the developed detection         technology and associated IP to be attractive to a world class         healthcare company (M&#246;lnlycke Health Care) and was the reason this         company chose to set up M&#246;lnlycke Health Care Scotland (MHS) in the         BioQuarter in Edinburgh".
[F1] The CEO of M&#246;lnlycke Health Care AB,       has confirmed the value to the company in 2012 [S2] "We are delighted         to be expanding our capabilities and product offering in close         collaboration with Scottish Enterprise and the University of Edinburgh.
This initiative marks our entry into the diagnostic market.
We are very         proud to be extending our offering of efficient infection control and         prevention solutions that make life easier and safer for health care         professionals and patients."
The central importance of the "innovative technology platform" developed       by the underpinning research is confirmed by M&#246;lnlycke Healthcare AB [S2,       S3] and by SE; their Director of Commercialisation has stated [S2] "...we         have been able to identify and secure the opportunity for M&#246;lnlycke         Health Care to develop its innovative commercial product based on our         platform technology at the Edinburgh BioQuarter in Scotland."
The       Managing Director MHC Scotland Ltd [F2] has said "The innovative         detection technology...uses Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)         to identify and quantify biomarkers that show the presence of pathogens,         such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
Current MRSA         screening often involves centralised laboratory facilities that can take         up to 48 hours to process results, during which time MRSA can spread.
By         using EIS we will be able to offer point of care testing (PoCT)."
[S3] The impact deriving from the underpinning research is therefore       directly to M&#246;lnlycke Health Care AB as evidenced by formation of a       significant new business venture and alteration of business practice,       through the adoption and commercialisation of our new technology platform.
Further evidence of the link between research and impact through company       formation and commercialisation is the strong Human Capital transfer from       UoE to MHC Scotland Ltd.
Since 2012, Till Bachmann, the project manager       for the ITI Programmes in UoE has been employed both in UoE and part-time       on a consultancy basis as the Scientific Programme Director for MHC       Scotland Ltd. Of the 8 personnel in MHC Scotland Ltd, 4 (Bachmann, PDRAs       Ciani and Schulze, Henihan) were UoE personnel working on the ITI       programmes whilst a fifth (Kaatz) is an EaStCHEM postdoctoral worker from       Mount's group with expertise in bioelectrochemistry and impedance.
Formation of MHC Scotland Ltd represents the first inward investment to       the BioQuarter and an important part of Scottish Enterprise's delivery       plan for economic benefit from the life sciences, as evidenced by the Head       of Chemical Sciences at SE; "As you know, Chemical Sciences are at the         heart of Scotland's economy, and chemistry is indeed the `science at the         centre'.
It also plays a key underpinning role with other key sectors         e.g.
life sciences, energy, chemicals and electronics.
The research         carried out at the University of Edinburgh which M&#246;lnlycke Healthcare is         commercialising is a prime example of the synthesis of research and         technology excellence that Scottish Enterprise is supporting and         promoting globally."
