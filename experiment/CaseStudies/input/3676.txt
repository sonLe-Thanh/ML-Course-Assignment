     Increasingly, and in response to the research and outreach of the GDN,       academic, policy and practical work has begun to include a gendered       analysis; highlighting inequalities, inequities and inefficiencies in       humanitarian practice.
This has resulted in recognition in government and       agency policies of the increased risk, vulnerability and impoverishment of       many millions of women around the world before, during and after       disasters.
The research undertaken by Fordham and others in the field has       been applied by actors seeking to change conditions on the ground for       vulnerable people, especially women and girls.
Key impacts described in       this section are therefore on policy and practice.
www.gdnonline.org,       the GDN open access website, allows the exchange of knowledge, resources       and training material towards the aim of empowering women and children in       particular to survive and then rebuild their lives following natural       disasters.
The website is run by Fordham and the accompanying members'       email discussion list is hosted by the United Nations International       Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR), and has been supported by       Northumbria University since 2002.
Background indicators of web-site       impact are:            In the year March 2012 to April 2013 the website received nearly half         a million hits with 1,828,365 pages viewed.
Visitors came from six         continents and over the last three years have included web hits from         over 80 different countries, including Australia, Brazil, China, Japan,         Indonesia, South Africa and Ukraine.
The registered membership list has grown from a recorded 592 members         in 2008 to 1,082 registered members on 22/04/2013.
Of those who have         listed their details in the Browse Members section (290), it shows the         members include: practitioners in the United Nations system (6%)         including UNDP, UNAIDS and UN Women; national and local governments and         donors (9%) including Canada, USA and Nepal; Non-Government         Organisations (NGOs) (32%) including CARE, Plan and Oxfam; the private         sector (3%); Community-Based Organisations working in disaster contexts         (CBOs) (4%); academic researchers (26%); independent scholars and         consultants (21%); the membership is drawn from several continents.
USAID/OFDA has funded the development of Gender and Disaster Network         Regional Hubs in: North America; Latin America and the Caribbean; the         Pacific-Oceania region; and Africa (further supported by North-West         University South Africa), indicating the broad international reach of         the GDN.
The primary purpose of the website is to host and act as a distribution       hub for gender and disaster resources.
These documents and links, posted       by users, are peer-reviewed by members and utilised by actors in the       disaster risk reduction field.
In addition to foreign language posts, core       resources have been translated into Urdu, Tamil, Creole, Portuguese,       French and Spanish.
Resources are regularly updated, to meet specific       regional requirements, for example, UN Women Pakistan provided support to       increase the scope and volume of the widely-used South Asian resources.
The success of the online resource has led to a number of exemplar       training courses that reflect the impact of the online resource.
In 2008       Plan International arranged training for Plan staff in El Salvador,       Bangkok and London on resilience and disaster risk reduction with an       emphasis on child protection and gender equity [Corrob.
5.2].
This       training used resources developed by GDN based on research by Fordham.
12       staff attended this training, as well as testing the ideas with local       people in three Salvadorean communities.
The UNDP commissioned training       based on GDN research to build gender mainstreaming capacity in national       governments, UNDP Country Offices and local NGOs in many parts of Asia [Corrob.
5.1].
In 2008 training sessions were run in Nepal (with 28       trainees), and in 2009 in Indonesia (with 26 trainees).
In 2010 UNDP       commissioned Fordham and GDN to design a training manual on `Gender and         DRR for UNDP BCPR', for use in 5 UN Regions: Africa; Arab States;       Asia and Pacific; Europe/CIS; and Latin America and Caribbean [Corrob.
5.1].
Following the advocacy work of GDN international policy increasingly       considers the importance of gender in disaster management and risk       reduction.
Specific examples include:            `UNISDR 2007 Words into Action: A Guide for Implementing the Hyogo           Framework'.
Fordham was one of a small team of gender experts         charged with contributing a gender analysis to this document on behalf         of GDN, the impact of which has occurred since publication [Corrob.
5.3].
`UN 2009 Making Disaster Risk Reduction Gender-Sensitive: Policy           and Practical Guidelines, UNISDR, UNDP and IUCN'.
Fordham was the         GDN contributor [Corrob.
5.4].
The Senior Communications Officer         at UNISDR has worked with Fordham to feed related material into the         International Day for Disaster Reduction 2012.
GDN also works closely with GenderCC Women for Climate Justice and         WEDO.
Together these groups contributed to policy advocacy and         interventions at UNFCCC meetings including Bali (2007), Pozna&#324;, Poland         (2008) and Rio+20 (2012).
In 2011 the UNECOSOC Commission on the Status of Women adopted a         resolution on `Mainstreaming gender equality and promoting           empowerment of women in climate change policies and strategies'.
In 2012 GDN were invited to contribute to the Asian Ministerial         conferences and policy development initiatives.
Fordham was a Gender         Core Group member for the drafting of the gender annex to the         declaration on Disaster Risk Reduction [Corrob.
5.5].
