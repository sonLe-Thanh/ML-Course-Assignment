     Friend's work has been used to inform and enhance the training of lawyers       and visitors working with detainees, and has contributed to activist       campaigns and to building public understanding of the lives and situations       of immigration detainees.
This was through the impact of the Border         Country exhibition itself, as well as via extensive press and       curatorial coverage of the exhibition [see Section 5, C1].
Requests for the re-use of Border Country material were received       from filmmakers, campaigners and visitor groups working to help       asylum-seekers.
Despite some restrictions imposed by the Home Office,       activist organisations (including Dover Detainee Visitor Group, Bail         for Immigration Detainees and the Testimony Project) were       able to use images from Border Country in their publications and       on their websites, and audio material from the project at conferences and       workshops [C2].
The Gatwick Detainee Visitors Group used the       project's images at its Annual General Meeting (2009), in training for       prospective new Visitors [C3].
Both Dover Detainee Visitor Group       and London Detainee Visitors Group raised funds through selling       copies of the Border Country book, the latter at the launch of the       research report Detained Lives at Amnesty Human Rights Action       Centre, 29 January 2009 [C4].
Friend was invited to talk about the project at public lectures and       exhibition openings.
The Belfast Exposed public opening in 2007 included a       discussion of immigration detention between Friend and Northern Ireland       immigration lawyer Anna Morvern.
As a result, Morvern then employed the       project's images and interviews when training lawyers for the Law Centre       (NI) in 2008, prior to the opening of the Larne detention centre, as well       as in professional talks on refugee rights.
For Morvern, the presence of       detainees' voices in the training room provided an immediacy and       tangibility to discussion of theoretical issues about the practice of       human-rights law in the field of immigration, vital for legal       practitioners new to the field [C5].
The work has also had cultural impact.
As a result of press coverage,       Friend was invited by writer Natasha Walter, director of the activist       group Women for Refugee Women (WRW), to participate in the staging of the       play Motherland on 14 January 2010 in Bedford, close to the Yarl's       Wood IRC, by using the Border Country images as stage backdrop.
The play, focusing on female and child asylum-seekers in Yarl's Wood, was       directed by Juliet Stevenson and performed by Stevenson, Harriet Walter       and others.
Natasha Walter said: `We wanted to bring the play to a local       audience.
There were MPs present &#8212; Patrick Hall and Alistair Burt, who       took part in a post-performance discussion of the work &#8212; and local       activists, as well as the management from Yarl's Wood and Serco [the       private company in charge of the centre], although they refused to engage       in discussions [C6].
The overwhelming response from the local people was:       "Not in our name"' (July 2010) [C7].
Hall and Burt went on to speak       against immigration detention practices [C6].
Direct audience responses (demonstrated through exhibition visitors'       books) similarly evidence the project's power to inform and challenge       public perceptions about immigration detention and the experiences of       asylum-seekers.
Examples of visitor comments are:             `Absolutely chilling &#8212; absence of people in images and presence in         sound works so well &#8212; the images are somehow gorgeous too'         (University of the Arts, London);        `The sound installation gives that personal edge and impacts on the         highly evocative and haunting spaces.
Very moving work...' (UoA);        `Fantastic insight to what actually goes on' (The Winchester         Gallery);        `As a student social worker on placement ... this was a great way for         me to gain an insight of what other detention centres look like behind         closed doors...' (The Winchester Gallery);        `The images tell a compelling and moving story of humanity and         inhumanity which we witness but fail to acknowledge until we are faced         with the reality...' (Gallery 44, Toronto) [C8].
Border Country continues to be a highly engaging and powerful         reference point for public and specialist discussion about immigration         detention, with its images and audio still being used, six years after         its original exhibition [C2].
