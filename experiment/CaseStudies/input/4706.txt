     The research has had a wide and significant impact on professional       practice at the local level.
It has also shaped national policy and       programmatic interventions and influenced national and international       guidelines on successful practice in closing the attainment gap.
Local impact (practice)     The research has changed teacher practices and LEA approaches towards       raising the achievement of BME learners at risk of underachieving across       England.
Case studies of Birmingham and Bristol offer examples of the       significance of the changes from 2008:     Birmingham: A former LEA statistician reported that:            Outputs from the research and findings [3] [5] underpinned resources         that were made available through the LEA's School Improvement Website         (Birmingham Grid for Learning &#8212; BGfL, between 2004 and 2012.
"This         included a number of DfE reports and guidelines; an African Caribbean         Achievement Plan; and school case studies"[h].
The LEA utilised these resources and the research findings to enhance         professional practice, informing "good practice relating to school         leadership, community partnership, mentoring, curriculum development,         and raising awareness/tackling racism and stereotyping [h]       The research [3] [5] reinforced the LEA's inclusion of mixed heritage         groups in the analysis of performance (GCSE and SAT results) and in the         analysis of "Every Child Matters" outcomes.
This is a practice which         Birmingham LEA continues to support and the performance analysis is         reported to the City Council Scrutiny Committee each year [h].
The data show that standards have improved for African Caribbean         students and mixed heritage groups since the research was published and         disseminated through BGfL.
"Although it would be difficult to establish         a direct cause effect relationship with these improvements and the         research, the research findings did inform the policies and practices         introduced to raise achievement"[h].
Bristol: The LEA service director has emphasised:            That the research [6] "has had a strong impact on awareness, policy         and practice.
Bristol LA refer to the report on a number of occasions,         including drawing it to the attention of head teachers and governors.
This has raised awareness and brought around a more informed dialogue         about the attainment of BME pupils"[g].
The research [6] has influenced professional standards, guidelines or         training, and has helped to develop a model of good practice in Bristol         which "has had a valuable impact in terms of raising awareness and         evidenced based discussions around policy and practice, and provides a         useful on-going reference point" [g] .
"In partnership with the Bristol Education Achievement Partnership         (BEAP) the LA commissioned an "easy read" version and booklet of the         report [6].
The booklet has been widely disseminated to schools and, to         stakeholder groups such as governors, parents, inter-agency NGOs etc.
BEAPare also in the process of developing digitally based resources and         guidance which are underpinned by the Making a Difference         report" [g].
"The November 2012 Bristol LA Annual Education Partnership Conference         attended by head teachers, governors, academy sponsors, inter-agency         NGOs etc.
focused on narrowing the gap in achievement.
The conference         raised the profile of the report, and Professor Gus John from the         Institute of Education was invited to speak with reference to the Making           a Difference" [g].
"The dissemination of the research finding [6] has impacted the         development of policy and practice around inclusion and diversity and         contributes to Bristol City Council's approach and awareness of         achievement issues affecting Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) Learners in         Bristol schools" [g].
National level (policy)     The research has impacted and shaped government policy in England, and       NGO's and professional bodies' policy from 2008 in the following ways:            Influence can be seen in the impact of the Aiming High programme         feeding into the content of the Black Pupil's Achievement Programme         (BPAP) [a], which ran until August 2008 and has been credited for         significant gains in the educational achievement of BME students.
Influence can be found in several guidelines issued by the DfES as         part of their national strategies, where research outputs have been         cited.
For example Aiming High [3] is included in a literature review of         six research projects on BME children in schools in the Excellence           And Enjoyment: Learning And Teaching For Black Children In The Primary           Years strategy [b].
The research underpins policy and best practice guidelines by         professional bodies and charities.
For example models of good practice         drawing from the Aiming High research [3] is cited in guidelines of         successful practice aimed at schools produced by the National Union           of Teachers and the National College for School leadership         [f].
The Joseph Rowntree Foundation cites Understanding the           Educational Needs of Mixed Heritage Pupils [2] in a paper         commissioned as part of its programme on poverty and ethnicity [i].
Practitioner debate has been informed and stimulated by research         findings.
This is evidenced in Times Educational Supplement (TES)         article Colour blind?
Not any more, an article engaging in the         debate about persistent gaps in BME pupil performance and exploring         issues around race equality and "colour blindness".
The article cites         "The final evaluation of Aiming High [3], led by Leon Tikly, Professor         in Education at Bristol University" which "found that there had been         impressive changes where schools routinely gathered data that was then         analysed and used for professional development and targeted programmes         of support" [j].
Regional and Global levels (Policy)     Insights developed through the combined research outputs have had a       Europe-wide reach:            Guidelines for inclusion and diversity underpinned by the research fed         into a booklet (http://www.britishcouncil.org/malta-indie-best-practice-guidelines.pdf)         and the British Council's INDIE Policy Makers Seminar involving         representatives from the Ministries of Education from 11 EU countries         [d], with the outcome being a "strong interest in widening the impact of         INDIE".
Dissemination has successfully targeted key policy makers and         practitioners in international agencies and NGOs.
It has fed into global         guidelines on raising BME achievement, inclusion and diversity and         research outputs have been widely cited in policy documents and         background papers.
For example [3] in the OECD Reviews of Migrant         Education &#8212; Closing the Gap for Immigrant Students: Policies,           Practice and Performance, which is "a report structured as a         concise action-oriented handbook for policy makers" [e], and [4][3] in Equal          Opportunities?
The Labour Market Integration of the Children of           Immigrants [c].
