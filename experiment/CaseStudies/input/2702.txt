     In the period 2005-2010, the world market for Technical Textiles (TT)       increased in value by US$ 20bn.
Today, TT is the fastest growing sector       within the global textiles and clothing industry (c. 4% growth per annum,       compared to 1% for apparel and home textiles) and in the UK it is worth       around &#163;3bn to the economy.
The research led by Stylios through TechniTex has helped more than 450       companies, addressed a range of technical issues through the provision of       advice, technical translation and assistance with research and product       development.
RIFLeX research has impacted directly in the period on product and       process development through direct collaboration with private sector       enterprises.
In Modelling collaboration with Moxon of Huddersfield and Camira Fabrics       Ltd both use what is commonly accepted fingerprinting of fabric behaviour;       Camira to map in their upholstery fabric performance user requirements and       in identifying the superiority of their fabrics.
Moxon, a manufacturer of       luxury worsted and woollen suiting fabrics for tailors such as Chester       Barrie established the technical superiority of Moxon textiles in terms of       quality, handle and drape, enabling the company to expand its product       range and to market its fabrics with a `certification of conformance' at,       for example, Premi&#232;re Vision, the world's leading commercial fabric fair.
A senior representative stated "Moxon is the oldest textile mill         established in 1556 and manufactures in Huddersfield the finest cloth in         the world.
Our Altai Cashmere, Royal Flannel and Vintage Cloth ranges         have been technically developed and accredited as "IDEAL CLOTHS" by Prof         Stylios's research.
Moxon uses these certificates when         selling/exhibiting internationally".
Camira Fabrics Ltd worked with RIFLEX research in the design and       prototyping of eight new upholstery fabrics, and their technical       compliance in terms of both manufacturing and performance.
Camira's sales       and turnover increased by 20% (2008-11) and it was awarded the Queen's       Award for Enterprise: Sustainable Development 2010.
In 2012, RIFLeX       assisted Camira with eliminating weaving production problems associated       with the skewness of one of its main commercial fabrics.
The elimination       of the fault has saved in rejects and production time and increased       customer satisfaction.
In measuring performance RIFleX worked with PIL Membranes Ltd to       characterise the filtration efficacy of its specialist membranes.
Before       the collaboration, there had been no reliable measurement of nanofabrics       (which burst under traditional measurement), so the project utilised the       Institute's unique filtration equipment; FilTex, see Ref 2, developed from       an EPSRC-funded research project (TP6/DAM/6/SK3043B).
It enabled PIL to       assess new products against chemical and biological substances, similar to       SARIN which has been used in the Syrian conflict, allowing them to       commercialise their products to clients requiring high levels of product       efficacy, including the military, emergency services, heavy industry and       the medical sector.
They confirmed "Our collaboration with the Heriot         Watt team enabled us to gain new knowledge on the filtration behaviour         of fabrics and through the new FilTex project apparatus developed, to         benchmark and further develop our membrane products" (a senior       technical officer of the company).
In Nanotextiles patents have opened up a new horizon for industry to       manufacture new yarns and fabrics for the domestic (fashion, retailing)       and technical markets (aerospace, automotive, shipping and civil       architecture) and for the nanoengineering of cashmere from guard hair       (waste product ) by Todd &amp; Duncan.
The work culminated in the       formation of NanoYarns Ltd, a new company start-up supported by an       external consortium of investors, a senior member of the investment group       (formerly McNeight &amp; Lawrance) said "Recognising the importance of         the nanotextile innovations by Stylios and his colleagues I have set up         an investing group of individuals aiming to prototype the work and go         commercial.
This work will bring the textile industry back to UK and         establish a new sector based on nano products for apparel, medical,         automotive, aerospace, shipping and civil engineering".
In Wearable Electronics development work with Mirolink in healthcare       monitoring of 'ECG, Respiration, Temperature' enables wireless monitoring       at a distance from the patient.
