     The impact emanating from the research has been to:            Enable NICE to employ a rigorous, fair and standardised methodology         with which medical devices and pharmaceuticals can be assessed, and         thus;       Support the selection of the most cost- and health-effective medical         devices and pharmaceuticals to be approved for public use;       Help pharmaceutical and device manufacturers seeking NICE approval to         implement processes and practices which are more efficient and         effective.
Healthcare Decision Making in NHS for England &amp; Wales     The National Institute for health Care Excellence (NICE) was created in       1999 in order to make timely and equitable decisions regarding the       appropriate use of health technologies (medical devices and       pharmaceuticals) within the NHS for England and Wales thus improving       patient care.
Since its inception NICE has radically changed the way in       which health technologies are assessed and appraised &#8212; using evidence on       both clinical and cost-effectiveness1,2.
Evidence regarding       health technologies on both clinical and cost-effectiveness is identified,       collated and synthesised by both commissioned academic groups and the       pharmaceutical industry/device manufacturers (often subcontracted to       specialist healthcare consultancy companies), and which is then appraised       by an independent technology appraisal committee at NICE.
This comprises       NHS healthcare professionals, academics (including Abrams since       2006), industry representatives and lay members.
The ensuing guidance       issued regarding the use of such health technologies is mandatory within       the NHS in England and Wales.
In addition to the academic and       pharmaceutical/device company submissions NICE may also call upon its own       Decision Support Unit (DSU), in which Leicester (Abrams, Cooper &amp;         Sutton) is a key member, to undertake ad hoc analyses and       bespoke methodological work,.
For example, Abrams3 led       the NICE response to the judicial review of the NICE appraisal of       alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene and strontium ranelate       for the primary (TA 160) and secondary (TA 161) prevention of osteoporotic       fragility fractures in post-menopausal women.
In addition to appraising       health technologies, NICE also has a remit to undertaken the assessment of       public health interventions under the auspices of its Public Health       Guidance Committee (of which Jones is a member).
Methods Employed by NICE &amp; Pharmaceutical/Device Industry for           Technology Appraisal &amp; Public Health Guidance     The methods to be employed by academic groups, DSU and industry in       undertaking submissions for NICE are set out in the NICE Methods Guide,       to which Abrams &amp; Sutton have contributed extensively       as members of Methods Task Forces ,and are specialist advisers on       evidence synthesis methodology1,2.
In particular, Abrams,       Cooper and Sutton have pioneered at NICE, (through       membership of the Appraisal Committee, DSU and contributors to the Methods         Guide}, the use of indirect comparisons or network meta-analysis in       technology appraisals and this has led to an increase in its use, for       example all 10 of the 212 technology appraisals published to 2011 which       used indirect comparisons or network meta-analysis appeared after       publication of 2004 Methods Guide which approved its use4.
Abrams &amp; Sutton has further contributed extensively to a series       of NICE DSU Technical Support Documents which have further       articulated the rationale and use of network meta-analysis5.
In       addition Abrams, Cooper &amp; Sutton have run       tailored bespoke courses for the pharmaceutical industry on network       meta-analysis, including courses for Novartis, Pfizer &amp; Roche (approx.
150 participants), as well as for NICE (approx.
50 participants) and       general courses (approx.
600 participants from consultancy companies,       industry and academia).
Further, Abrams has provided       methodological consultancy services to both major pharmaceutical companies       (Bristol-Meyers-Squibb, GSK, Janssen, Novartis, &amp; Roche) and       healthcare consultancy companies (Amaris, OptumInsight, &amp; PRMA) on       network meta-analysis.
Abrams, Bujkiewicz, Cooper       &amp; Sutton undertook implementation of comprehensive decision       model in user-friendly real-time software and piloted it in a NICE       Technology Appraisal Committee meeting in order to aid more timely       decision making on tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors in psoriatic       arthritis6.
In addition to short courses and consultancy activities on evidence       synthesis, including network meta-analysis, Abrams &amp; Lambert       have delivered courses, provided consultancy and undertaken contract       research projects on methods for dealing with treatment switching in       oncology clinical trials to inform HTA for ABPI, Amaris, GSK,       OptumInsight, and Roche.
For example, in the area of locally advanced or       metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive malignant melanoma Abrams       provided expert advice on most appropriate methods for adjusting for       treatment switching which led to an eventual positive decision by NICE       (subject to a patient access scheme) for Vemurafenib [Roche] which       represents an innovative therapy in this poor prognosis condition in which       80% die within 2 years of diagnosis7.
Lambert has also       provided methodological advice as a member of the Academic Reference Group       to the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership.
As a measure of contribution to UK economy, since 2010 the ability to Abrams       to provide expert methodological advice on methods for evidence synthesis       and treatment switching to Amaris (a health-care consultancy company) has       resulted in them being awarded projects with a combined revenue of [text       removed for publication], including them being awarded `preferred vendor       status' by Roche in 2013.
In terms of Public Health decision making, Cooper &amp; Sutton       undertook a network meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of       interventions to increase the uptake of smoke alarms as part of a NIHR       Programme Grant and which has been included in an update to NICE Public       Health Guidance 29: Strategies to prevent unintentional injuries among         children and young people aged under158.
Using       comprehensive decision modelling techniques pioneered at Leicester, Abrams       &amp; Gillies undertook further modelling for the Department of       Health to inform the UK Vascular Screening Programme9.
International Impact     As well as disseminating and promoting methodological developments in the       UK, Abrams, Cooper &amp; Sutton have delivered       short courses of evidence synthesis in the US to the Agency for Healthcare       Research and Quality (AHRQ) which have adopted some of these innovative       methods10.
In addition Abrams has acted as an advisor       to both the Brazilian and Colombian Ministries of Health as regards       methods for HTA, whilst Lambert has delivered short courses on       advanced survival methodology, developed at Leicester, to the       International Association of Cancer Registries (approx.
60 individuals)       and North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (approx.
30       individuals).
This significant body of translational activity &#8212; delivered through       committee membership, contract research, consultancy and training       delivered by key academics &#8212; is fundamentally underpinned by research in Evidence         Synthesis and Decision Modelling Methodology and Survival         Analysis Methodology pioneered at Leicester.
