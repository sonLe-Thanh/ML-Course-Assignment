     The new chemical reagents for transfection described and protected       (above) were licenced to Deliverics, a new company which specialises in       cellular delivery products and technologies, spun out of EaStCHEM in       November 2010.
Deliverics used the IP in both the in vitro reagent       market as well as having longer-term interests in in vivo uses.
These unique, chemical-based, biodegradable transfection reagents have       broken into both the "research tool" (reagent) and the "RNAi therapeutics"       (drug delivery) markets, delivering economic, human capital, and potential       health benefits.
A.
Economic: spin-out of the company Deliverics     The significance of Deliverics' commercialised biodegradable       transfection reagents impacts on both the "research tool" and the "RNAi       therapeutics" markets and arises from their ability to out-perform       existing materials, without the immunogenicity, manufacturing issues, and       carcinogenicity previously seen for current viral vectors used as delivery       agents.
This presents a wide ranging ability to deliver nucleic acids into       cells and tissues for biological applications.
[S1]     The reach of the company is international, despite its youth.
It       has an international customer base, including specially appointed       distributors in Spain (Albyn Medical), S. Korea (CoreSciences), and US       (Galen).The customer base (20 research groups and 10 companies) spans 5       countries.
at Scottish Enterprise Enterpreneurial Support Manager has       said, "There is significant scope for Deliverics to expand its         distribution network overseas.
We're very positive about the future and         looking forward to working with them as they continue to grow.
"[S2]     The turnover of the new company is &#163;330k to date.
[F1]     Deliverics Ltd has so far launched the following products:[F1]     - SAFEctinTM is a biodegradable transfection kit.
- SAFEctinTM-STEM is targeted at the stem cell market, a       market estimated at &#163;100M pa.
This reagent offers over 90% transfection       efficiency of RNA into stem cells in a simple, one-step protocol.
- New SAFEctin beta product, developed with TSB grant &#8212; out performing       SAFEctin, SAFEctin STEM, HappyFect and LipoFectamine 2000 in siRNA       delivery, and showing &gt;70% transfection efficacy in notoriously       difficult cell types such as human fibrosarcoma HL116, primary mouse       lobular breast cancer cells, mouse embryonic limb cells and primary human       monocytes.
Client testimonies:     '[Text removed for publication].'
[S3]     'The product that Deliverics has developed is a simple one-step         protocol that is easy to perform and produces very high transfection         efficiencies of our embryonic stem cells.
During use, cells exhibited         high levels of expression and remained healthy.
I think this is a great         product that will become market-leader over time.
