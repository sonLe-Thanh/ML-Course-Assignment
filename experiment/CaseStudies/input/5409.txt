     Impact with Ofcom     Ofcom is the independent regulator and competition authority for UK       communications industries.
Valletti was a member of its Panel of Academic       Advisors and its Spectrum Advisory Board (2007-11).
Decisions have       frequently been based on his research.
In its 2011 Statement, Ofcom decided to cut mobile         termination rates (MTRs), adding `the impact of lower MTRs on the       level of mobile prices will mostly arise from the potential impact of a       decline in MTR payments from fixed communications providers.
`This is         in line with the empirical findings of a Genakos and Valletti's recent         paper' [B, point 7.54].
The Chief Executive of Ofcom has attested to       the influence of Professor Valletti's research, stating that "the policy       implications of the two papers [5 and 6] featured prominently in our final       decision on this policy matter' and that his work "deals with relevant       (and complex) policy questions...[which are] highly relevant to       organisations such as Ofcom where policy making is based on a rigorous       assessment of the available evidence" [C].
Can we value the benefit of this impact?
According to the 2011       "Communications Market Report: UK" issued by Ofcom UK, the volume of calls       to mobile phones was 45bn minutes.
The regulator decided to cut the mobile       termination rates from 4.18 ppm (rate at 01/04/11) to 0.69 ppm (from       1/04/2014).
Therefore, without even considering that lower prices will       cause a higher number of calls, this reduction will cut costs to         mobile phones by more than &#163;0.5bn per year, every year.
This is a       lower bound to the estimated benefits for UK consumers.
Ofcom made this decision having full regard to the indirect adverse       consequences that it was likely to have:     `In addition for `post-pay customers (who, by definition, are willing to       pay subscription charges), we consider that the greatest impact will be an       increase in subscription charges rather than in usage charges (which       should decrease)....
This view is consistent with the empirical         evidence in a recent paper in which Genakos and Valletti assessed the         effect of reducing MTRs on different tariff structures.
They found that,         for post-pay customers, there was a strong waterbed effect, and that         this mainly came through the fixed component (i.e.
the subscription fee)         rather than the variable component (i.e.
usage charges).'
[D, points       7.70 &amp; 7.71].
Ofcom also cited Professor Valletti's work in Wholesale Mobile Voice         Call Termination, Preliminary Consultation on Future Regulation,         Consultation (2009) [E]:     `There is scarce evidence about the magnitude of the waterbed effect.
Recent academic papers have reached mixed conclusions.
Genakos and         Valletti (2007)54 looked at whether a reduction in Mobile Call         Termination charges by regulation led to an increase in retail prices,         and found that the waterbed effect is large, but not complete'....Consequently         `given the lack of conclusive evidence, Ofcom decided not to rely         heavily on any assumption of an incomplete waterbed effect.'
[E,       Points 5.12 &amp; 5.13, 2009].
A similarly worded paragraph also appears in Wholesale Mobile Voice         Call Termination, Market Review Volume 2 &#8212; Main consultation [F,       point 5.29].
This work is also cited in the Ofcom report Mobile Call Termination,         Annex 6, Relevant Empirical Studies, `Genakos and Valletti test whether         the waterbed effect in mobiles exists and, if so, its significance.
They         consider whether the introduction of regulation on fixed-to-mobile         termination charges has affected the structure of prices but not the         overall profitability of mobile operators.'
[G, point 20, May 2009]     Impact at the Competition Appeals Tribunal     Valletti was a witness during a BT appeal against Ofcom regarding       Termination Charges, held on 14 April 2011, where his research was used       extensively, and decisively, during the case.
Describing him as `an         expert economist', the final judgement report confirmed that `Dr         Valetti [sic] &#8212; as the author of the only detailed study of the         waterbed, was clearly best placed to comment on the likely size of the         Mobile Tariff Package Effect.... As an expert, he was very properly         identifying for us the limits of expert knowledge in this area'.
The       report concluded that `basing ourselves mainly on the evidence of         Professor Valletti, we find that the waterbed effect in the present case         would be significant, but otherwise impossible to quantify' [H,       Points 363-364].
Valletti also submitted evidence and acted as a witness to a second       appeal in October 2011.
The case is ongoing at present so no public       documents / transcripts are currently available.
Membership and Advice     Valletti's work on regulation of interconnection rates and long-run `bill       and keep' system is cited extensively in UK and EU documents.
He is a       member of the UK Competition Commission Academic Panel who `act in an       advisory capacity to staff.
These individuals have been invited to sit on       the panel because of their particular experience and research in the area'       [I].
His expertise has been recognised by his appointment in October 2013       to the European Commission's Economic Advisory Group on Competition       Policy.
He has also acted as an expert advisor to the EU Commission on the       definition of remedies for potential market failures in mobile markets       (2004), and redefining the list of relevant markets potentially subject to       ex ante regulation (2006).
