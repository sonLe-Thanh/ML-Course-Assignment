     A sustained and wide-ranging campaign of public engagement has allowed us       to achieve an array of cultural impacts, including bringing lay audiences       to ask themselves new questions and reassess familiar problems;       stimulating debate with respect to those questions and problems; and       encouraging non-philosophers to explore material they would not otherwise       have encountered.
Media appearances     On August 20, 2008, Janaway recorded a `Philosophy Bite' on aspects of       Nietzsche's philosophy of value (`Philosophy Bites' are podcasts of       philosophers discussing their research for the benefit of a lay audience),       drawing on outputs 2 and 3.
At September 17, 2013, his contribution has       had 107,330 downloads [5.1].
On October 29, 2009, when the programme devoted an episode to       Schopenhauer, Janaway was an expert guest on BBC Radio 4's `In Our Time',       hosted by Melvyn Bragg.
He drew on outputs 1, 2 and 5 for the broadcast,       which attracted an audience of more than 2 million and sparked a lengthy       discussion on the BBC website, during the course of which the episode was       described as `riveting', the discussion as `very helpful', `lucid' and       `brilliant' and the contributors as `fantastic' and as `models of       clarity': `It opened my eyes: I'd never imagined that I would find       Schopenhauer congenial'; `I was inspired' [5.5].
This appearance led to invitations to take part in three further radio       programmes.
The first, Resonance FM's `Representing Arthur Schopenhauer',       was broadcast on February 28, 2012, to an audience of ~30,000 and was       later released as a podcast by Philosophy Now, resulting in       ~60,000 downloads [5.2].
The second, BBC Radio 4's `Honest Doubt',       involved episodes broadcast on June 8, 14 and 15, 2012, to an audience of       ~750,000; in February 2013 Ladbroke Productions responded to what it       called `popular demand' by producing a digital audio download and ebook of       the series, for which it anticipates a total of more than 4,000 downloads       [5.3].
The third, BBC Radio 3's `Wagner and Schopenhauer', was broadcast       on May 22, 2013, attracted an audience of ~150,000 and was subsequently       made available as a podcast.
In each case Janaway drew on outputs 1, 2 and       5.
Janaway's appearance on `In Our Time' also led to an invitation to write       an article for the Times Literary Supplement (circulation:       ~34,000) to mark the 150th anniversary of Schopenhauer's death.
Published       on October 13, 2010, the piece prompted another lengthy online discussion,       during which readers developed a variety of responses to Schopenhauer's       pessimism [5.6].
Public discussion events     On November 20, 2008, at a session in London hosted by the Forum for       European Philosophy, an educational charity that brings philosophy to the       wider public, Janaway was interviewed about his work on Nietzsche before       an audience of ~60 participants, drawing on outputs 3 and 4.
On January 17       and 18, 2009, at the Department of Continuing Education, University of       Oxford, Janaway drew on outputs 5 and 6 to lead a two-day seminar, `The       Philosophy of Schopenhauer', for ~40 participants.
Southampton's Philosophy Caf&#233; talk-plus-discussion events, held at the       University's John Hansard Gallery, are advertised to and attended by       non-philosophers, including non-academics.
They usually attract audiences       of about 40 [5.4, 5.7].
On October 7, 2010, drawing on outputs 1 and 5,       Janaway presented a session on Schopenhauer's pessimism.
Representative       feedback suggests that well over 90% of respondents have been caused to       `think about unfamiliar topics or about familiar topics in new ways' as a       result of attending these events, which participants have found       `stimulating', `full of ideas' and, on occasion, `completely brilliant'.
On May 12, 2014, Janaway was principal contributor to a Nietzsche       `Cultural Day', organised in collaboration with the University's Lifelong       Learning team with the intention of engaging a wider audience in dialogue       on our research on Nietzsche.
His talks drew on outputs 1, 3, 4 and 6.
Although it is not possible to determine the number of downloads, podcasts       were also made of the constituent sessions.
More than 60 people attended       (at &#163;25 per head), with participants giving the event an average score of       4.8 out of 5.0.
Some 94% of respondents agreed that the event had `changed       their understanding of and attitude towards the subject matter', while 91%       agreed that they were `likely to use the ideas they had heard about in       future', in contexts ranging from their own teaching activities to       `personal reflection on [my own] writing practice'.
`Thoroughly enjoyable       and stimulating'; `A very interesting and thought-provoking day'; `A       wonderful opportunity for someone not necessarily on a university/FE       course.
Affordable!
Hurrah!
Thank you.'
