     In November 2009 Dr Ord founded the organisation Giving What We Can.
This organisation is dedicated to the fight against poverty in the       developing world.
Its members pledge to give at least 10% of their income       to aid and to direct their giving to the organisations that have a       demonstrated ability to use their incomes most efficiently.
The most       significant impact of his research is the amount of money pledged by the       326 members of this organisation: over US $130,000,000.
(One notable       member is the philanthropist Dr Fred Mulder, who visited the organisation       in 2013 and who was sufficiently impressed by the passion and energy of       those working in it that he announced in a public lecture that very       evening that he would donate &#163;180,000 to the organisation, together with       &#163;80,000 over the next three years.)
The money pledged has the potential to       save lives.
In fact, if we accept an estimate in Disease Control         Priorities in Developing Countries, the amount pledged is enough to       save nearly 57,000 lives[i].
There is also a highly successful offshoot organisation called `80,000       hours', encouraging people to pursue careers that will enable them to       become more effective altruists[ii].
This was created by       graduate and undergraduate students in Oxford, but now has active support       throughout the world: its Director of Careers Research, its Career Impact       Assessor, and the person developing its on-line social network are all       working in American universities.
Not long after these two organisations       had been established, they&#8212;along with two others, Effective Animal         Activism and The Life You Can Save&#8212;were united to constitute       the Centre for Effective Altruism[iii].
This Centre has       been a registered charity since 2012 and is now supported by six full time       team members, including staff and interns.
Giving What We Can has       itself now grown to the extent that it has chapters not only at Oxford but       also at Cambridge, Princeton, Harvard, Rutgers, UC San Diego, Warwick,       Canberra, Switzerland, and Birmingham: these are local branches of the       organisation working in areas where there is a high density of people       interested in working together to promote its goals[iv].
Dr Ord provides ongoing advice on ethics and cost-effectiveness to Oxfam       Great Britain, and consultation on cost-effective ways to fight disease to       Oxford Analytica.
He also wrote a chapter of a report for the Centre for       Global Development, launched at the House of Lords in 2012, and has had       talks with a special adviser to the Prime Minister, with the Secretary of       State for International Development, and with the World Health       Organisation[v].
In April 2013, he participated in a       working group of the World Health Organisation tasked with writing a       handbook on ethical advice for setting up universal coverage health       systems in developing countries: this handbook will include a special       emphasis in the cost-effectiveness that he advocates.
That same month he       also met representatives of the World Bank to discuss the possibility of       the World Bank's undertaking a major project to set global priorities[vi].
Owen Barder, a senior fellow at the Centre for Global Development, said in       an interview in 2012, `One thing I have learned working in this industry       is that there is a tendency to [promote]... all these different good       causes... [Dr Ord is] partly pushing against that... and saying that we       need to focus much more on the things that have the biggest impact...
Thank you for all you're doing to help people in the developing world'[vii].
In addition, Dr Ord's countless talks, presentations, and media       performances have promoted the ideas behind Giving What We Can and       encouraged reflection on these ideas[viii].
They include       the following, each of which has reached out to an audience consisting at       least partly of non-academics:            participation in a conference in Tanzania in June 2009 on the ethics         of priority setting in global health;       a talk entitled `Choosing a Cause: The Differences and Similarities         Between Fighting Climate Change and Fighting Global Poverty' in the         University of Oxford Climate Change Week in December 2009;       a talk entitled `The True Value of Time and Money' to a Royal College         of Art special seminar series on time and money in February 2011;       a talk entitled `Taking Charity Seriously' to BarCamp Nonprofit in         Oxford in November 2010;       a talk entitled `How to Have Ten Thousand Times the Impact: The         Pivotal Importance of Cost-Effectiveness in Delivering Aid' to Oxfam         Great Britain in Oxford in March 2011;       a contribution to a conference entitled Valuing Lives at New         York City in March 2011, advocating the Quality Adjusted Life Year         method of priority setting for charities;       a talk entitled `Taking Charity Seriously' to Barclay's Bank in         Cheshire in May 2011;       participation in a conference in Seattle for philosophers and         economists to advise the Global Burden of Disease report, produced by         the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, on how to measure the         badness of disease and disability;       participation in a workshop entitled Issues in Priority Setting           for Health in Surajkund in February-March 2012, discussing whether         and how to use discount rates in global health priority setting, and         including a presentation on what information needs to be included in the         new (third) edition of Disease Control Priorities in Developing           Countries, the world's major analysis of which health         opportunities are most important (this was supplemented in April 2013 by         a contribution to a conference of the Disease Control Priorities Project         for the same purpose);       a presentation at `Intelligence Squared' in April 2013;       opposition to the motion `This House would support Britain before         Burundi' at the Oxford Union in April 2013 (the motion was defeated by         270 votes to 70).

Dr Ord has also been interviewed on the ideas behind Giving What We         Can by (among others) The Guardian, The Wall Street         Journal, The Independent on Sunday, The Chronicle of Higher         Education, The Financial Times, The Tablet, The         Australian, The Daily Mail, The Times, The Sunday Times,       The Observer, The Daily Telegraph, The Scotsman, The         Herald Sun, The News Statesman, BBC (both television and radio,       including an interview for `The Moral Maze' and an interview for       `Breakfast') [ix], American Public Media, NBC, The       World, Talk Sport, Fox News, and Sky News, all of which has drawn his       ideas to the attention of the general public.
One particularly       high-profile endorsement of the organisation has been that of Professor       Peter Singer in a talk at the Technology, Entertainment, and Design       conference in Long Beach California in March 2013: this talk has been       viewed over 320,000 times (there is a link to it on the front page of the       organisation's website).
In 2011 Dr Ord was included in an Independent         on Sunday list of the top one hundred `outstanding examples of       people who volunteer, care, educate, or do something special to make       Britain a more contented, better-adjusted, and supportive place'[x].
