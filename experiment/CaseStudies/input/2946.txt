     Research at the University of Manchester on the changing dynamics of       defence technological       innovation has led to policy and practice change.
The beneficiaries have       been a multinational       defence aerospace company, a European government and the European       Commission.
IMPACT 1: INTRODUCING OPEN INNOVATION IN A LEADING UK DEFENCE AND         AEROSPACE MULTINATIONAL     The research has contributed to a changed approach to the strategic       management of technology in       a leading UK based defence and aerospace multinational company       contributing to a radical shift in       its funding and a new emphasis on open innovation.
BAE Systems is a global       defence, aerospace       and security company with an annual turnover of over &#163;19 billion employing       around 88,200 people       worldwide.
Research on the changing dynamics of technological knowledge       sourcing [1] as well as       James' on-going research programme on the changing dynamics of defence       technological       innovation enabled him to win a funding bid from BAE Systems to undertake       a study to evaluate       new business models for the BAE Systems Advanced Technology Centre (ATC)       (2004-2005) [D].
The research study examined the applicability of a unique open innovation       model that addressed       the specific needs of the ATC and options for future business models.
ATC's "journey" towards an       open innovation approach started in 2004 and the Manchester study was the       starting point for an       on-going dialogue between the Director of the ATC and James on how to       implement a move from       closed towards more open innovation, improve engagement of the ATC with       external sources of       technological knowledge and alter its funding.
The research provided an       evidence base to support       the shift in strategy and was used by the ATC Director to gain internal       "buy in" within the company.
In his statement [A] the Director of the ATC commented: "Defence and         the ATC have         predominantly operated under a more closed innovation model and the work         from Andrew James         and Manchester Business School was fundamental in starting the journey         of the ATC on this         "closed" to a more "open" business model."
In 2008, BAE Systems launched its Investment in Innovation (I3) programme       as a key element of       its open innovation strategy.
I3 is a multi-million pound annual       investment fund for small and       medium sized organisations to develop technologies for the company's       defence and security       customers.
It also provides non-financial support, drawing upon BAE       System's engineering, project       management and technology resources including test and evaluation       facilities.
The Manchester       research also stimulated a radical shift in the funding base of the       organisation: ATC has moved       from a model of 80%:20% internal:external funding to a situation where 80%       of its funding comes       from outside BAE Systems.
At the same time, the business has grown from       circa &#163;30m per annum       to circa &#163;50m per annum today.
The research by James was also used by the       Director of the ATC       to inform his contribution to a Ministry of Defence-industry examination       of open innovation which       led to the establishment of the MOD's Centre for Defence Enterprise (CDE).
ATC working with the       MoD in a joint National Defence Industries Council (NDIC) Research and       Development Working       Group helped develop and implement CDE &#8212; an on-line innovation portal to       access innovations       from non-traditional defence suppliers including academia and Small Medium       Enterprises &#8212; key to       the principles of open innovation and in accessing the broader supply       chain for defence.
This       influence of the research of James in this area is further confirmed in       the statement [A] from the       ATC Director; "The work was also very influential in the dialogue that         the ATC had with the MoD,         Science and Technology organisation, (now Dstl) in creating an         establishment of the MoD's Centre         for Defence Enterprise (CDE) innovation portal."
IMPACT 2: SWEDISH GOVERNMENT DECISION NOT TO PRIVATISE LEADING         GOVERNMENT LABORATORY     The research has also had a direct impact on the decision of the Swedish       government not to       pursue the privatisation of its government defence research laboratories       (FOI).
In 2010-2011 a       Swedish government inquiry investigated the forms of delivery of Swedish       defence research       (Swedish Government inquiry "SOU 2011-36").
Currently, a major part of       Swedish defence       research is carried out in-house by government.
The inquiry studied       options for changed forms of       delivery, including privatization.
The Swedish Defence Research Agency,       FOI, furnished the       inquiry with background material for its analysis and recommendations.
FOI       collected evidence on       the changing dynamics of defence research and the reform of government       defence research       establishments in other countries, including the UK.
Three studies by       James were identified as       directly relevant [1, 3, 5] and James was approached by FOI to provide       expert testimony.
His       research was used as the key source of independent analysis of UK defence       laboratory reform,       confirmed in a statement [E] from the Coordinator of International Affairs       at FOI; "Three of Dr         James' articles were analysed at FOI together with mostly         government-issued material (such as         Report from the Defence Select Cttee of the House of Commons) in order         to draw conclusions         from the UK experience that would be valuable for Sweden".
In       addition, the concept of the       defence innovation system used by James in his research was adopted by the       inquiry as its       intellectual framework for its investigation.
This was used by FOI to       argue the case towards the       inquiry: "the research that had already been performed by Dr James,         proved to be most relevant         for our needs and provided a sound basis for our provision of facts to         the inquiry" [E].
Based on the       analysis the inquiry [F] listed the policy options but did not propose any       change in forms of delivery.
The Government has subsequently not pursued the alternative of       privatization and defence       research will for the time being, continue to be provided within       government.
IMPACT 3: FORMULATING EUROPEAN UNION POLICY ON THE SECURITY INDUSTRY     The research has also had a direct impact on the development of policy at       the European level and       directly shaped COM (2012) 417 Security Industrial Policy [G] and the       supporting Commission       Staff Working Paper [H, C].
The research standing of Manchester, in the       field of defence and       security innovation, led James and the Manchester Institute of Innovation       Research to be invited in       2010 to join a consortium to provide research services to the European       Commission (DG       Enterprise) (Framework Contract of Security Studies ENTR/09/050) in       support of the preparation of       the Commission Communication on Security Industrial Policy.
Manchester       (James, Rigby and       Teichler) participated in a series of high-level workshops with senior       Commission officials and       contributed to three studies (Study on the pre-commercial procurement in       the field of security;       Study on civil-military synergies in the field of security; and, Study on       regulatory framework,       certification and conformity assessment in the security sector).
COM       (2012) 417 Security Industrial       Policy and the supporting Commission Staff Working Paper were published in       July 2012 and       contain extensive citation of those studies in support of the Commission's       policy proposals.
A       statement [B] from the Deputy Head of the Security Research Unit at the       European Commission       confirms this contribution: "Dr James and the Manchester Institute of         Innovation Research have         actively contributed research that has been underpinning COM (2012) 417         and its supporting         Commission Staff Working Document SWD (2012) 233.....the Manchester         Institute provided highly         valuable analytical support to the Commission"
