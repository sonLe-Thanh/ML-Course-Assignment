     The Long Life has most directly improved the quality of public       debate about our ageing society       through its impact on two leading UK consultation groups on ethics and         public policy.
Small       was invited to contribute to a consultation at St George's House, Windsor       Castle, 10-11 November       2011, chaired by the President of Age UK.
What is Successful Ageing:         Responding to an Ageing         Population in the 21st Century was the       first in a series of St George's House consultations on       ageing, aiming to reset the parameters for policy discussion in the UK.
Participants included the       Group Chief Executive of Age UK, the Director of the Henry Smith Charity,       the Older People's       Commissioner for Wales, the Director of Policy and Research at the Joseph       Rowntree Foundation,       the head of End of Life Care and Dementia for NHS West Midlands, Midlands       and East England, a       Senior Fellow of the King's Fund, and senior representatives from the       fields of gerontology, social       policy and practice, health care consultancy.
The discussion assessed the       challenges of an ageing       population, including the costs and benefits to the economy, and the       social, medical, and       psychological implications of old age dependency.
Small gave the starting       address, her brief being       to reflect on how the subject of ageing has conventionally been treated in       our culture, and how it       tends to be treated in public policy discussions today, then to identify       ways in which the       conversation might be improved.
She drew in part on The Long Life's       considerations of philosophy.
A summary of her starting address forms the opening part of the subsequent       official report, What is         Successful Ageing?
: Responding to an Ageing Population in the 21st       Century [i] - an open access       on-line publication, sent out to many of the most influential participants       framing social policy for       ageing in the UK, including the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the       International       Longevity Centre, the Henry Smith Charity, the NHS Institute for       Innovation and Improvement, and       leading medical educationalists and gerontologists.
The programme       director, Gary McKeone       comments that "Professor Small's book `The Long Life' was central to the       thinking behind the event... By setting the topic in a broader cultural       and intellectual context [she] added real ballast to the       discussion."
[1]     As a direct consequence of speaking at St George's House, Small was       invited to join a second       consultation, on Changing Expectations of Death, held at the       Queen's `think tank', Cumberland       Lodge, 23-25 November 2012.
Participants included the Chief Executive of       the National Council for       Palliative Care, the Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Dying       Well, the Director of BME       Cancer Communities, and the Medical Director of the Marie Curie Hospice,       Hampstead.
Small       spoke in response to James Woodward, Canon of Windsor Chapel, drawing on       material from The         Long Life about the definition of a good life and the ends of life.
On this occasion she was asked to       reflect specifically on the autobiographies of three writers (Christopher       Hitchens, Tom Lubbock,       Philip Gould) for whom medical extension of life came at heavy cost to       quality of life.
Her remarks,       summarised as part of the official open-access report, prompted close       debate about a `crisis in       secularism' [ii].
She worked closely with the consultation       report's author, editing the draft text and       making additions and suggestions for improvements.
The report was sent to       306 recipients known       to have an interest in the subject.
The Dying Matters Coalition (a growing       coalition aiming to       `change public knowledge, attitudes and behaviour towards death, dying and       bereavement')       requested and received permission to tweet it (10,782 Followers).
The       Association of Hospice and       Palliative Care Chaplains was also given permission to post the report on       their website.
The       associate director of programmes observes that `Professor Small was       invited to speak ... on the       basis of her recognised expertise in considering old age and death through       the lens of both       philosophy and literature.
As Cumberland Lodge seeks to promote       cross-disciplinary discussion for       this conference we brought humanities academics together with scientists,       doctors, psychologists       and religious leaders.
The contribution of Professor Helen Small was       crucial and pivotal: her       prepared paper raised several vital questions which were then explored in       discussion, and those       with alternative areas of expertise were able to support and add to the       case made [regarding a       crisis in secularism].
Professor Small's contributions to discussions       throughout the conference       were equally valuable.
Although we operate under the Chatham House Rule       and therefore do not       generally attribute comments in our reports [we can say that] Professor       Helen Small's contributions       make up a significant part of the final summary report.'
[2]     A review of The Long Life for the journal of the Centre for       Policy on Ageing and The British Society       of Gerontology brought the book to the early attention of gerontologists         and geriatricians and       led on to many invitations for Professor Small to expand the debate within       their field.
Thomas Cole       (historian of old age, and director of the McGovern Center for Health,       Texas) described the       research as "a powerful searchlight which can help us illuminate       contemporary moral questions       that call out for theoretical reflection, social and cultural study, and       practical engagement ...
The         Long Life is a superb contribution to philosophy and literary       criticism and will become an       indispensable landmark for understanding longevity in ...humanistic       gerontology."

In March       2012, Helen Small was asked to address old age health care professionals       and graduate students       at the Staffordshire University Centre for Ageing and Mental Health.
The       director, Paul Kingston,       commented on the stimulus given to their group of c. 40, for whom the       "usual intellectual diet is       evidence based medicine": the "contribution was most valuable in expanding       our thinking in       gerontological studies."
(Letter, 21.3.12) [3].
The Centre for       Policy on Ageing Information Service       lists The Long Life among its recommended `Selected Readings' on       ageing [iv].
It is a further mark       of her growing influence within the medical/gerontology community that she       was invited to give a       plenary lecture to the British Society of Gerontology for the Society's       Annual Conference,       September 2013.
An indication of The Long Life's impact on how old age         specialists in other universities are       engaging with health care workers and those involved in the community         support of the         elderly is the invitation to Small to be keynote guest speaker at       the launch of Keele University's       New Dynamics of Ageing Programme `Ages and Stages Project' in November       2010.
This event       brought humanities specialists together with practising gerontologists,       social workers, people       working in community education and theatre, and members of the general       public.
David Amigoni,       co-director, confirms that `The Long Life helped us to define and       locate the critical philosophical       and historical commitments of the project as an integral part of the       interdisciplinary conversations       we have held with literary critics and art historians, composers and       musicians, care practitioners,       psychologists, medics, community workers etc.'

Further impact in the way of helping to shape a public debate about       ageing is evidenced by the       reception of Small's contributions to media and festival debates about old       age.
The Thomas       Hobbes Festival (Malmesbury), 2008, devoted a session to The Long Life,       with Small in       conversation with the philosopher Jonathan R&#233;e (c. 60 attendees) - an       event which stimulated       lively audience discussion about what we can expect from a philosophy of       old age.
Radio 3       Nightwaves asked her to participate in a discussion of the meaning       of old age, with novelist Lynne       Reid Banks and the historian Pat Thane (broadcast 19.2.13) [v].
The         Long Life's exploration of       philosophical frames for thinking about old age has also influenced two       writers' autobiographical       reflections on ageing.
Jane Miller's Crazy Age: Thoughts on Being Old       (2010) [vi] draws on The         Long Life's account of the difficulty of fitting old age into       standard notions of the good life (see also       her article for the US online news magazine, In These Times [vii]),       as does Penelope Lively's       Ammonites &amp; Leaping Fish: A Life in Time (2013) [viii].
