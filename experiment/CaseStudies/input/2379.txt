     The University of Salford has pioneered practice-based research work in       the field of Brass Band       studies as a key area of research in performance and composition,       extending significantly       beyond the University, with the introduction of the practice-led and       brass-specialist PhD and       DMA programmes, and the subsequent integration of brass band research into       University of       Salford SMRC research programmes.
It has achieved this through:            Enabling practitioners to develop professional standards, and assume         world leading roles in         the field through the integration of new research methods into their         practice.
SMRC research         has been followed closely by many composers directly supervised by         Graham, which has         since made a measurable impact on the brass band community through being         set as         competition test pieces, often for the bands in lower sections (leagues,         as in football).
The         fusion of several genres, cutting across the conventional art/popular         division, continues to be         a prominent feature of these works.
With the development of a dedicated research focus on brass bands,         Salford has awarded         research degrees to many key figures in the brass band movement,         including Nicholas         Childs (conductor of Black Dyke Band), Robert Childs (conductor of Cory         Band), Stephen         Cobb (Director, International Staff Band of the Salvation Army), Kenneth         Downie (composer         of 19 test pieces), Martin Ellerby (composer of 10 test pieces), Luc         Vertommen (conductor of         leading Belgian band Brassband Buizingen), Rodney Newton (composer),         Nigel Clarke         (composer, former Associate Composer of Black Dyke Band), James Gourlay         (General         Director, River City Brass, Pennsylvania, and former Head of Brass at         the Royal Scottish         Academy for Music and Drama), Goff Richards (composer/arranger), Sachi         Uchida         (Japanese composer of brass band music), Roger Webster (leading cornet         player) and Peter         Meechan (composer and chair of the British Association for Brass and         Wind Ensembles).
These `agenda-setting' musicians have an impact on the music performed         beyond the scope         of their research projects: for example, in the case of Belgian         conductor Luc Vertommen,         they go on to have an impact internationally by importing British         composers, and in         particular, the music of fellow Salford researchers into the rapidly         growing Belgian banding         scene.
Vertommen has contributed arrangements of several works by         British composers         John Rutter, Peter Graham and Salford graduate Paul Lovatt-Cooper, which         have been         widely performed in Belgium and elsewhere in Europe, and conducted the         2010 premiere of         `Earthrise'         by Salford DMA Nigel Clarke.
Salford Brass Band researchers continue to         attract         leading players and composers as research students.
Current students         include: Brett Baker         (trombone soloist, Black Dyke Band) and David Thornton (Euphonium         soloist, Black Dyke.
Evans' recording of the brass version of Karl Jenkins' The           Armed Man: A Mass for Peace         (2007) with proceeds going to Brass Band Aid, pushed the boundaries of         the brass band         genre through its integration with orchestral performance disciplines: "I           first heard this on the           BBC as the lead in to the 2 mins silence 11/11, I was really moved and           congratulate the           producer on their choice."
Reviewer, Amazon (2009)           http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Armed-Man-Mass-Peace/dp/B0011FI294           Brass band research impact develops opportunities for amateur musicians       to participate in       professional standard and creatively challenging music-making, promoting       inclusion and       personal and community aspiration, and increasing participation.
It       develops opportunities for       communities to engage, collaborate and achieve to a standard in musical       expression, raising       skills and aspirations and promoting community regeneration as many bands       have thrived in       areas of multiple exclusion:            SMRC brass band research programmes focus on the interaction between         composer and         performer, and it is this collaborative approach that has informed the         technical innovations         created, particularly in the area of test pieces.
The brass band         movement in the UK and         worldwide is organised around the principle of competition in a number         of different sections,         equivalent to the league structure in sport.
Competitions generally         feature between 10 and         20 bands playing a single set piece, with the adjudication carried out         by an expert jury who         cannot see the band playing to ensure that only musical-technical         criteria are used to make         the assessment.
Enhancing, exponentially the repertoire of brass bands         by bringing         contemporary "concert hall" concepts and techniques to amateur music         making, setting         competition standards to which brass bands aspire:       Within this framework, the composition of a `set-piece' literally sets         the technical and musical         demands for the musicians competing at that level, and also defines the         level towards which         bands in lower sections aspire.
Set pieces are often repeated for         several competitions,         meaning that many hundreds of musicians over a period will rehearse one         set piece over a         period of a decade or more, and it may serve as a benchmark for the         standards required by         promotion to a particular section.
In addition, a test piece appropriate         to the particular section         can be chosen by an individual band as an `own choice' in some         competitions.
The influence of Salford composers over this unique form of technical         benchmarking for         music can be established, leading the development of brass band cultures         internationally,         from the UK to the US, from Scandinavia to Australia:                 Graham's 1994 Montage has been used as a set test           piece at Championship           level on           13 separate occasions, and has been chosen as an `own choice' on 48           occasions.
Featuring in 1995 in the Norwegian National Championships; the           European           Championships (ten times), the British and Scottish Opens (seven           times), in smaller           competitions such as the Fife Charities Band Association Contest and           in April 2013, in           the North American Championships.
A total of 197 bands have rehearsed           and           performed Montage, totalling just less that 5000 musicians.
Graham's 2002 Harrison's             Dream featured as a Contest Test Piece in the New South Wales           State Championships           and in 2009, in the World Music Contest.
2012: The University of Salford hosted the North West           regional auditions for the           country's leading youth brass bands, with fifty of the nation's most           accomplished brass           players between the ages of eight and 18 hoping to be chosen to join           the National Youth           Brass Band of Great Britain (NYBBGB) and National Children's Brass           Band of Great           Britain (NCBBGB).
SMRC has developed strong links with the NYBBGB in           particular,           over many years.
The band was directed and run for 17 years from 1984           by the late Dr           Roy Newsome, a former member of University staff, and a number of           current staff are           also involved with the organisation.
Many NYBBGB members move on to           Salford to           study music, with the University enjoying a reputation as one of the           leading institutions           for brass band scholarship in the UK.
The University's Head of           Classical Performance,           Dr Howard Evans, said: "We're extremely proud to host the auditions             for both bands             every year.
They offer the finest young brass players in the country             a fabulous musical             experience in their chosen field and many members go on to pursue             accomplished             careers as professional musicians."
Young musicians on the day           have the chance to           learn from the audition panel experts, who will give a brass master           class, and a number           of successful players will be chosen to join the youth or children's           bands.
Through the development of a research environment and staff expertise         to guide this         integration, a focus on the rich cultural history of the brass band         sector through the         University's brass band archive, and close links with ensembles         internationally, SMRC         research has informed the ways in which the brass sector operates and         thrives.
