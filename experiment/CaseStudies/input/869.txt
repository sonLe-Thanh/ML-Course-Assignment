     The key impact of the Index is that it puts the expertise of       University of Leeds researchers at the       disposal of the archaeological community at large, including commercial       and community       archaeologists operating outside academia, such as those on rescue       excavations and in museum       and local authority teams.
(It is estimated that 90% of archaeological       investigations in Britain since       1990 have been undertaken by commercial organisations [A].)
Representatives of this community describe the Index as       `indispensable', `essential', `unique',       `authoritative' and `infinitely superior to any previous method of       identifying and dating stamps'; one       says it `is a tool which has been needed for decades' [B &#167;&#167;2-5].
`A       number of commercial       archaeology units have invested in the Index to make their work       more efficient' [B &#167;1]; `it is       essential for doing any work on samian stamps and its possession would be       assumed by anyone       commissioning [commercial] work' [B &#167;3].
The Leeds Index enhances professional practice in archaeology in       various ways:            The scale and detail of the data which it makes available increases         the precision of the         information provided by the widely distributed terra sigillata         for the western Roman empire.
Since pottery is one of the key dating indicators in archaeological         investigation, this enhances         stratigraphic and chronological analyses of individual excavation sites.
It allows the archaeological community direct access to the data,         enabling them to process         material themselves, more efficiently and accurately than ever before.
Their comments include:         `for the first time it is possible to quickly and reliably identify         stamps' [B &#167;1]; `I now have a quick         and reliable way of identifying stamps, mould stamps and signatures' [B           &#167;5]; `there are no         alternative methods of identifying and dating samian potters' stamps         reliably' [B &#167;4].
The         comprehensive use of images is `invaluable in making secure         identifications' [B &#167;1].
Practitioners have emphasised the extent to which the Index         `speeds up analysis and reporting'         [B &#167;6]: `It has saved an enormous amount of time' and is `vastly         quicker' [B &#167;3], `probably a         75% saving of time' [B &#167;2].
Efficiency gains on this scale bring         obvious commercial advantages         since much rescue archaeology is linked to property development.
The database makes it possible to contextualise finds and assess the         significance of patterns         of trade and communication revealed by the distribution of the wares of         different potters and         workshops geographically and across time - not least because owning this         fine, decorative and         moulded pottery denoted a certain social status.
Commercial         archaeologists have recognised         that this makes samian ware a tool for addressing broader socio-economic         issues: `It has         stimulated me to look at wider questions of dating and trade patterns' [B           &#167;2]; `the index         contains a mass of data which can be used to look at wider economic and         social questions -         how pottery was marketed, who used it etc' [B &#167;3]; it is `an         invaluable tool providing a basis not         only for identification and dating, but as a data-source for social and         economic studies' [B &#167;6].
The volumes have been distributed in Europe, the US, Australia and South       Africa and are already       held by university libraries around the world.
Sales details from the       publishers of both the volumes       and the DVDs [C, D] show that their distribution goes well       beyond research libraries.
Citations of       the Index in excavation reports also confirm it as a standard work       of reference, e.g.
:            the report from a community excavation at Middlewith in Cheshire,         which applies the         Index's dates to stamped samian finds from the site [E(i)]       the report from excavations at Piercebridge Roman Fort, in the care of         Darlington Borough         Council, carried out by independent consultants Barbican Research         Associates [E(ii)].
Over 3,500 scientific data requests received online through the RGZM       database further confirm the       Index's widespread application [F].
Even so, its full       `impact on the archaeological community ... is       just beginning to be felt' [B &#167;1].
By enhancing the identification and social contextualisation of samian       ware, the Index also opens       up new possibilities for museums to use their collections for educational       and public engagement.
A       representative of Leeds Museums and Galleries said the knowledge gained       through the use of the       Index was informing her own work and that of education staff in       enhancing information held about       the collection to in turn enrich public engagement opportunities.
She       adds: `The enhanced       cataloguing of the Samian ware will enable the museum service to take       fresh approaches to its       display and interpretation...not only for KS2 groups studying the Romans,       but groups of up to KS4       learning to use objects as historical tools'.
`The improved understanding       and knowledge of the       Leeds Samian ware collection would enrich and potentially alter       interpretation of pieces on display       in permanent galleries focused on Ancient Worlds.'
