     In parallel with the underpinning research activity, Rolls-Royce (who       were a partner on our EPSRC-sponsored process damping research) identified       a need for a new disc production facility in order to meet the demand for       new engine platforms.
The role of the AMRC's research is explained by       Rolls-Royce [S1] as follows:     [text removed for publication]     For each example disc, the underpinning knowledge concerning process       damping and special tool geometry was implemented to achieve vibration       free and high productivity machining of the titanium or nickel alloy       component.
This increased resistance to vibration meant that more flexible       fixture configurations could be used, further reducing the cycle time for       each component.
Other research activity also supported the resulting business case [text         removed for publication], but the research undertaken in the unit       (Section 2), and the subsequent technology development programme at the       AMRC (above) is cited by Rolls-Royce [S1] as one of the important factors.
[text removed for publication]     The new factory also will have a tangible societal impact on the local       community, since the new production facility will regenerate the former       Dunlop Tyres site, which was closed in 2006 with the loss of 585 jobs       [S7].
More broadly, the research has had a secondary impact by informing public       policy and contributing to parliamentary debate concerning the development       of the UK's Catapult Centres [S8].
