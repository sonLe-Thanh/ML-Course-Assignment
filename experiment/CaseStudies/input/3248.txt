     This research has identified two important reasons why infection rates of       M. abscessus are       increasing in patients with CF, namely predisposition to infection through       azithromycin therapy       and person-to-person transmission of infection.
This work has impacted on patients with Cystic Fibrosis in the UK and       internationally, their       families and the health professionals who care for them by: a) increasing       understanding of how       people acquire M. abscessus infection; b) changing the way       azithromycin is used to treat       patients with Cystic Fibrosis; c) driving changes to how CF patients are       cared for and protected       from cross-infection within hospital and at home and d) changing how air       ventilation systems       are designed in Cystic Fibrosis centres, such as the planned unit in new       Papworth Hospital.
The finding that long-term azithromycin therapy impairs host immunity to       NTM was widely       discussed within the CF community (1,2), the media (3) and at CF       conferences (4) has led to       the following specific changes in guidelines for clinical practice to       ensure safer use of this drug       (1,5):            increased the frequency of sputum sampling for NTM in CF and non-CF         patients receiving         long term azithromycin       patients with previous or current NTM infection should not receive         azithromycin apart from         as a component of multidrug treatment regimens       Azithromycin should not be used as a component in treatment regimens         for macrolide         resistant NTM infection.
The finding that person-to-person transmission of M. abscessus       occurs frequently amongst       patients with Cystic Fibrosis was widely disseminated by national (BBC;       ref 6) and international       (7-10) media organisations and the UK CF Trust (11).
Since these transmission events occurred through indirect spread and       despite national       standards of infection control, there is concern that urgent changes to       cross-infection protocols       are required (11).
This research has already led to changes in infection control at Papworth       Hospital (12):            Individuals with M. abscessus infection now wear a surgical         mask at all times within the         hospital buildings except when in a ward side room or a clinic room and         are nursed in a         negative pressure single room separate from the CF ward;       staff with structural lung disease are advised against working with         these individuals;       staff caring for NTM infected patients now wear protective clothing         when performing         aerosol-generating procedures and room and equipment cleaning policies         have been         changed          This work has also led to changes in the design of the Cystic Fibrosis       centre within the new       Papworth Hospital building to ensure all rooms have balanced ventilation       allowing negative       pressure isolation for individuals with M. abscessus.
