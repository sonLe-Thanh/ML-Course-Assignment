Shaping public policy and local authority commissioning of           telecare     Local authorities and the NHS are aiming for a substantial increase in       telecare provision.
Lancashire County Council (LCC) is currently using our       (EFORTT) Ethical Framework in preparing specifications for procurement of       a new telecare service.
Our Framework emphasises the importance of sharing       information about usage patterns amongst actors in the telecare network,       the value of pro-active calling, the significance of monitoring centre       workers in providing care to lonely users and the need to protect local       networks of care while expanding the service.
All local authority/NHS       services must demonstrate the highest levels of effectiveness: our       recommendations are assisting the Council's Adult Services Directorate to       shape a service that will be well used.
Mark Luraschi, LCC Locality       Commissioning Manager said:     Whilst in the role of Telecare Project Manager for Lancashire County         Council, I was pleased to collaborate with and support the EFORTT         project.
Our engagement was a two way process with lots of questioning         and examination of policies, processes and methods of delivering         Telecare within Lancashire.
The process of investigation and subsequent         published articles did lead to myself and various colleagues         re-examining aspects of Telecare and its delivery to the citizens of         Lancashire, especially around issues such as technology as replacement         for human care, and the potential for increased social isolation amongst         older and vulnerable adults due to heavier reliance on technology based         monitoring systems.
Our research has been presented to policy makers and service providers at       regional, national and European levels such as senior managers at LCC (May       2011; Oct 2012; Sept 2013), a North West NHS/EU Innovation event (Oct       2011), presentation to the MADoPA/ACCOMPANY FP7 project (Paris June 2012).
As invited participants at the EC High Level Workshop on Future Technology       and the Workshop for European Parliamentarians on Responsible Innovation       (Brussels Nov 2010), EFORTT has been instrumental in initiating the Responsible         Research and Innovation agenda and shaping EU FP8/Horizon 2020.
We       contributed a chapter to the EU policy report Towards Responsible         Research and Innovation in the ICT and Security Technologies Fields       and ran a workshop at the Does Europe Care?
conference (www.careconference.eu/site/).
Our work has also highlighted social and ethical issues for social workers       prescribing telecare (article in the UK's leading practitioner       publication) and third sector providers (AGEUK radio debate Nov 2012,       expert briefing, May 2013 and commissioned knowledge transfer publication       July 2013; Spanish Red Cross).
An unsolicited response from Anne Tidmarsh,       Director of Older People and People with Disability at Kent County Council       describes the significance of our work for service development:     I attended the [MEDUSE] conference last year and received your         publication [Mort et al, 2008] a few weeks ago.
I would just like         to thank you for sending this to us.
It was very good to see all the         information together in your study.
I would also like to say that Dr         Robert Stewart and I are still building on the information provided at         your seminar and are hoping to take quite a few elements forward.......         Our Telecare Board was extremely interested; they are keen to look wider         than our standard format now.
And from an unsolicited email from Craig Frost, Locality Commissioning       Manager, Adult Services, Lancs Co Council:     Many thanks for producing this paper for us &#8212; it's really helpful.
I         will forward to relevant colleagues, including Tony Pounder and Roger         Hulme, and we can certainly use it when we start to get into detailed         discussions with One Connect Ltd and the chosen Service Provider about         the service model and design.
Our work has led to improvement in remote care service provision       internationally: following our participative conference a key figure in       the Red Cross (Catalan telecare provider) stressed our project's success       in opening up `a stronger connection with users' and a (re)orientation       towards meeting users' specific needs rather than providing a generic       service.
This is a shift towards more ethical, socially-aware and       effective care:     Participation in this research group with professionals from different         sectors and countries has provided us a great number of contributions,         debates and perspectives that have enriched us enormously and let us         improve with important and different ideas from our daily work.
It has         opened us a range of practices and comprehensions about elder people         care.
In this way, we have a stronger connection with our users and are         able to adapt present and future projects to their necessities and         particular features (Oliver Cubells, Mobile Telecare Service and       Technological Support for Older People, Red Cross.)

Shaping corporate investment in biosensing     Our contributions to developing more ethical and socially aware forms of       telecare and biosensing recently found new reach in the corporate world.
In face-to-face and virtual engagements with anthropologists, engineers,       designers and managers from Intel Corporation (the microchip-manufacturing       multinational), we have exposed the limits and potentials of the use of       sensing technologies to collect personal biological data (biosensing) in       two fields: reproduction and personalised genomics.
Our empirical research       and most recent citizen's panel (May 2013) highlight both the potential       for biosensing devices to create anxiety in some users and the keen       interest that many display in `playing with' personal biological data.
Members of the citizen's panel raised concerns around regulation, trust,       security, accuracy and personal, familial and societal impact of       biosensors.
Our research has had a significant impact on Intel's decision       to invest in this new field.
In face-to-face meetings at Intel, Santa       Clara and regular international teleconferences, as well as via written       reports, we have provided empirically-informed arguments about the social       and ethical implications of particular biosensing practices (for example,       our strong concerns about the impact of home ultrasound scanning for       pregnant women).
These interactions have influenced investment and design       decisions at Intel.
Dr Dawn Nafus, Intel Lab Biosensors Project Lead,       writes,     The Living Data project have been close collaborators for Intel, both         in its internal R&amp;D capacities and in strategic planning         functions... researchers at Lancaster have informed Intel's decisions         with respect to a new, and potentially significant market for us:         consumer-driven biosensing.
This includes decisions we have to take in         terms of investments, acquisitions, and technical designs).
[NB: the       precise nature of this investment is commercially sensitive.]

Staging citizen/public deliberation and opportunity for           influence over telecare and health biosensor development     `Upstream' engagement and informed debate about major policy directions       and new technology development has been a key focus, involving a wide       range of citizen actors in England and Europe.
This has been achieved       through 1) Staging 22 older citizens' panels about remote care systems       (average 10 people per panel) over 18 months in England, Netherlands,       Spain &amp; Norway 2008-10; 2) Radio debate on AGEUK's The Wireless       (audience 100,000) available as podcast:                https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/agenda-on-wireless-14th-november/id541099875?i=125432886; 3) Blog on AGEUK website:                http://ageukblog.org.uk/2012/10/21/will-the-sensors-look-after-us/;       4) Production of a booklet for telecare users and carers, concisely       summarising the EFORTT Ethical Framework as a series of critical questions       that older people, families and carers can ask when debating whether to       install telecare systems, (1,000 hard copies circulated in the UK through       older peoples', carers' and local authority networks and downloadable       from: www.lancs.ac.uk/efortt       and Age Platform Europe: http://www.age-platform.eu/en/age-policy-work/accessibility/links;       5) A two-day citizens' panel (May 2013) to gauge public opinion about       reproductive/assisted conception devices and direct to consumer genetic       testing; 6) Invited Expert Briefing to AGEUK organisation May 2013 and       invitation to participate in AGEUK's current `major Knowledge Transfer       project: summarising research about what works in service interventions       for older people'.
