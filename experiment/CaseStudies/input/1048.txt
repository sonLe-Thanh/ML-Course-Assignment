     A key feature of Kelly`s work on identity has been close collaborative       work with Russians, both as members of the project team and as informants.
The research starts from, and feeds back into, the experiences of members       of the general public.
The interviews were often highly significant for       the participants and members of their family, for example, sometimes       interviewees would air experiences they had not talked about before       because they thought no one was interested.
Their memories also helped to       suggest new lines of investigation.
For example, a chapter of Kelly`s book       on Petersburg [&#167;3.6] is devoted to the importance of districts, something       almost never remarked on by foreign commentators but which turns out to be       very important to locals.
During his work on interviewing Russian &#233;migr&#233;s       in Britain, Byford became an informant about life in the UK for       interviewees who had almost no contact with locals, and so on.
In turn,       this new content has facilitated impact at a variety of different levels,       including:     A new view of contemporary Russia for policy-makers and other         professionals       In 2009, Kelly gave a keynote address on Russian national identity at the       UBS Arts Forum, `Go East: Contemporary Arts in Central and Eastern       Europe`, attended by gallery owners and museum staff from across the       German-speaking world.
This was intended to give professionals who have       increasing contact with the art scene in Russia and other post-socialist       countries an immersion in the cultural background [i].
She also addressed the Youth Policy Conference at Upshaw, County Durham,       speaking about Russian childhood to an audience of social workers and       other professionals involved in work with children and young people [ii].
Other ways in which research material from the projects has been used       include a satellite investigation sponsored by Geschichtswerkstatt Europa       that included a play about the life of migrants into Russian cities based       on interview transcripts, performed at the British Consulate in Petersburg       [iii].
This provided the mainly expatriate audience with       a view of a side of Russian life with which they have little direct       contact.
The Oxford conferences on national identity were attended by a number of       policy-makers, including Elizabeth Teague, analyst of Russian Politics at       the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office [iv].
Andy       Byford was invited to a briefing at the Russian Embassy in London in order       to discuss perceptions of `Russianness` among &#233;migr&#233;s, as part of the       Russian state`s efforts to engage in nation-building abroad.
The interview       database [&#167;3.8] has been used not only by scholars and students for their       work, but also by creative writers and by those working in applied areas       of social science, such as Erica Richardson, who works for the World Heath       Organisation and consulted the interviews with paediatricians and other       medical professionals working with children.
In her words: `Health care       workers are the most valuable resource in any health system and their       attitude towards changes in the system determines whether reforms will be       implemented or undermined.
Therefore, it is imperative to hear their       voices - this doesn't always happen.` [1]     Contributing to public debates in the UK       The studies of Russian identity [&#167;3.6, &#167;3.7] have generated a good deal of       media interest, and Kelly is regularly approached to contribute to       discussions based on her expertise in this area, in turn raising public       awareness and understanding of the topic.
As well as various invitations       to discuss `Putin`s lifestyle` which were turned down, there were many       serious requests - for example, Catriona Kelly appeared on BBC Radio`s       `The World Tonight` in order to discuss the Pussy Riot case (September       2012) and was invited to take part in a discussion of modern Russia on BBC       Newsnight (August 2013, had to be declined).
Public events have included       an appearance by Kelly at a discussion of modern Russia at Waterstones       Bookshop, Oxford (9 May 2013), to mark the shortlisting of the first ever       Pushkin House Russian Book Prize in 2013 (Kelly appeared with the writer       Andrew Miller and the historian Robert Service) [v].
A       critical review written by Kelly of Oliver Bullough`s The Last Man in         Russia, published in the Guardian (7 June 2013), about the       alcohol-fuelled decline of Russia, was described by the books editor of The         Guardian as `such a good piece` and has led to further commissions.
The article provoked a heated debate in the reader comments with around 40       posts discussing Kelly`s arguments, the trends in alcohol consumption in       Russia compared to other countries, and if the author, or more generally,       if the West was `Russophobic` or not.
Engaging with Russians in debates about national identity       Several of the project workshops were held in Russia, and were extremely       well attended, including by representatives of heritage preservation       organisations, who were able to put their views forward also at `Global       Aspirations and Pastiche Identity`, a conference organised by Kelly and       Professor Andreas Sch&#246;nle at QMUL.
The conference was attended, for       example, by representatives of Moscow Architecture Preservation Society [vi].
Kelly has also taken part (in April 2013) in a Russian TV debate about the       destruction of architecture in Soviet Leningrad.
Her work has a high       online presence with Russians: for example, Children's World       [&#167;3.3] was described by the leading poet and influential blogger, Linor       Goralik, as one of the best ten studies of Soviet everyday life [vii],       and in an online interview, the famous Russian historian Evgeny Anisimov       described her book on Pavlik Morozov [&#167;3.5], translated into Russian in       2009, as a model of how to write history [viii].
At a       different level of engagement, Kelly is a regular user of Facebook, with       over 500 `friends`, many of them Russian, and uses the site primarily as a       resource for discussions about contemporary Russia and a way of locating       research materials.
Kelly`s lecture talking about the history of the       Museum of the History of Leningrad (December 2012) was selected as a text       for dissemination on the online portal `Lectorium`, which is a Russian       non-profit organisation providing access to educational materials of       outstanding quality.
Increasing knowledge and understanding among the general public       In August 2012, Kelly was invited by Dmitry Esakov, director of the       cultural programme for the Volga Dream line offering high-quality river       cruises for visitors to Russia, to present a programme of lectures during       a cruise from Moscow to St Petersburg [ix].
In his       letter of invitation, Esakov wrote: `we try to invite guest speakers who       are connected to Russia professionally and can speak about the subject       passionately.
I was very impressed about the way you chose you show life       in Russia - through the attitude to childhood.
This along with excellent       recommendation from Geoffrey [i.e.
Professor Geoffrey Hosking] makes us       very interested in inviting you on the Volga Dream` [2].
The lecture programme attracted a lot of interest at the time, and       passengers have written since to say that they enjoyed the lectures [3].
One of them has been in touch to ask Kelly about his family history, and       she was able to put him in touch with some academic experts who would be       able to tell him more about one of the documents he had (an internal       passport issued by the short-lived Soviet administration in Khabarovsk at       a period after the issuing of passports had been terminated by the central       authorities).
Kelly has also been acting since February 2010 as a consultant to a       project organised by Anthony Gould, an independent UK businessmen, to       market recordings from the State Archive of TV and Radio for commercial       use [4].
She produced a short citation about the       importance of the archive for use in publicity material, and has been       invited to present an introduction to a series of CDs being produced by a       company in Germany using this material.
In December 2012, Kelly was contacted by the Irish artist, Gareth       Kennedy, commissioned by a local authority in Petersburg to produce `The       Last Wooden House of Kupchino`[x].
Kennedy wrote: `I have been       reading with great interest your "Making a Home on the Neva" which I came       across online.` Kelly provided Kennedy with local contacts and a briefing       session on Petersburg history, which informed Kennedy`s installation and a       film made about it.
