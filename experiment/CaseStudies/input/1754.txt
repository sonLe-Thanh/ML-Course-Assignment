     The breakthrough discoveries on oxygenases have had specific impacts       including the following.
Identification/validation of new drug targets for diseases ranging         from anaemia to cancer that are being pursued by multiple companies [7 -         10].
Enabling work in the Oxford University laboratories (1996-2002) followed       by that in the spin-out ReOx (2002 onwards), demonstrated that       small-molecule mediated inhibition of the HIF prolyl-hydroxylases       upregulates proteins of major medicinal relevance (e.g.
EPO and vascular       endothelial growth factor, VEGF), thus validating the HIF hydroxylases as       drug targets (see Section 2).
Subsequently, pharmaceutical companies,       including GSK, Merck, Bayer, Fibrogen/Astellas, Akebia, and Johnson and       Johnson have targeted the prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs),       demonstrating very widespread interest in them as targets for the       treatment of anaemia, and ischaemia-related diseases including heart       disease and diabetes.
At least 2 of these companies have PHD inhibitors       which were progressed during 2008-2013 such that they are now in       late-stage clinical trials, including for anaemia (worldwide market &gt; &#163;       50 billion).
For example, FibroGen, Inc. and Astellas Pharma Inc. have       reported the initiation of clinical studies in the Phase 3 clinical       development program of FG-4592/ASP1517, an orally administered small       molecule inhibitor of the HIF prolyl-hydroxylases, for treatment of       anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease in patients, to support       approval in the U.S. and Europe [7].
Phase 2 clinical studies showed that       FG-4592/ASP1517 demonstrated "anaemia correction in treatment-na&#239;ve CKD       patients not on dialysis as well as maintenance of hemoglobin in CKD       patients on dialysis and not on dialysis."
GSK have reported a "Phase IIa,       Randomised, Single-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group clinical       study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of 28-day       Repeat Oral Doses of GSK1278863A, a HIF prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor, in       anemic pre-dialysis and hemodialysis-dependent patients."
[8].
At Bayer,       "a Phase IIb program with the investigational new drug Molidustat (BAY       85-3934) is under initiation in patients with anaemia associated with       chronic kidney disease and/or end-stage renal disease.
Molidustat is a       novel inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase (PH)       which stimulates erythropoietin (EPO) production and the formation of red       blood cells.
Phase I data have shown that inhibition of HIF-PH by       Molidustat results in an increase in endogenous production of EPO."
[9]       Akebia report that "AKB-6548 and AKB-4924 are 2 selective HIF-PH [HIF       prolyl-hydroxylase] inhibitors" ....."have profound effects for anaemia,       wound healing and anti-microbial therapy.
Akebia's HPTP03b2 inhibitors       modulate Angiopoietin-2 activity and represent an exciting new approach in       the treatments for vascular leak, retinopathy, cancer and critical limb       ischemia (CLI)" [10]     Oxford's identification of one of the HIF hydroxylases as a JmjC protein       stimulated work leading to their assignment as histone/chromatin       demethylases acting on all 3 N-epsilon methylation states of       lysine.
Because of the fundamental role of histone methylation in the       regulation of gene expression, sometimes in an epigenetic manner, the JmjC       histone demethylases have also attracted considerable attention as       potential targets for diseases ranging from cancer to genetic diseases (by       several companies including GSK, Genentech, and Epitherapeutics).
Andrea       Cochran of Genentech states [11] "Oxford is one of a very small number of       academic institutions at the leading edge of early-stage drug discovery       and target validation in epigenetics" and "Each of the specific examples       cited [relating to oxygenases and bromodomains] addresses problems that I       have heard discussed internally multiple times and that have real impact       on our ability to develop drugs against these targets."
Commercial sale of products including (i) small-molecules arising         directly from Oxford work, (ii) antibodies arising directly and         indirectly from Oxford work [12-13].
Oxford Chemistry work and that of its collaborators has directly or       indirectly resulted in commercially available products for biomedical       research.
With respect to 2OG oxygenase/demethylase inhibitors, the       Schofield group initiated a joint Wellcome Trust-funded project with the       Structural Genomics Consortium, the NIH and (ultimately) more than 10       industrial partners and the National Institutes of Health, USA, to       identify and distribute small molecule inhibitors of `epigenetic'       enzymes/proteins for use in probing biological function.
Duncan Crawford,       CSO of Tocris Bioscience, says [13] "This research has helped to open up       an entirely new product line for (Tocris) in the past 3 or 4 years by       generating small molecule probes for epigenetic research.
We think this is       likely to remain a very exciting field for us for the next decade or       longer."
Some of the oxygenase/demethylase inhibitors arising from work in the       Oxford Chemistry laboratories (in most cases in collaboration) are now       commercially available, for example:            Tocris Biosciences sells the following small molecules relating to         Oxford precompetitive work on oxygenases and epigenetics: Daminozide,         IOX1, IOX2, JQ1, DMOG, GSK J1, GSK J4 (arising from collaboration with         GSK), OXFBD 02 and OXFBD 03.
