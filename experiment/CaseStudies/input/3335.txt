     The research has helped the pendulum swing away from fear-based       approaches in schools, childcare, and sport.
Impact is extensive in terms       of scale and scope; it can be identified at all levels: perceptions,       policy and practice regarding the investigation of allegations of abuse;       regulations and procedures re vetting; guidelines regarding appropriate       touch between adults and children at LA, school, and sport level.
This is       an incremental process, but significant change can be identified,       indicated by wide media coverage and the range of agencies and       organisations involved &#8212; see below:     Policy Impact:     The impact of the research into touch and teachers was demonstrated by       approaches from DfE officials prior to the Importance of Teaching White Paper 	  (2010, endnote 43), in which the ESRC       (RES-000-22-0815) report is referenced, alongside additional data       commissioned from Piper.
Substantial media coverage (available here       and here)       followed the intervention of Secretary of State Gove to an overly       risk-averse NSPCC initiative advising music teachers not to touch       children.
While politicians will present any good idea as their own,       successive paragraphs of this Gove letter, and also of Gove's speech The failure of child protection and the need for a fresh start       (16.11.12), evidence wording and arguments drawn from the publications on       touch (ESRC report here),       unambiguously demonstrating significant impact.
Similarly national  plans for vetting were scaled down, 	  following a wider campaign to       which the research contributed.
The research (Sikes &amp; Piper 2010) on       false allegations provided evidence published by the House of Commons Children, Schools and Families Committee 2008-2009, 	  which also led to further research by the DfE Allegations of abuse against teachers and non-teaching staff.
Problems of false allegations are also acknowledged in the White Paper 	  referred to above (see endnote 41).
In sport too, where the       research made public, and gave voice to the concerns of many experienced       coaches and teachers, there are indications of change.
Wider Dissemination and International Impact:     The research attracted fruitful engagement (eg Free Play Network, 	Manifesto Club, 	Manchester Salon, 	Inspired2Greatness, and further dissemination opportunities),  	including overseas (eg Free Range Kids).
The international interest included invited collaborations       with significant researchers including professors: Richard Johnson (US),       Keith Lyons (Aus), Clive Pope (NZ) Hiroyuki Fujitahi (Japan) around touch       and false allegation.
This also led to interdisciplinary work with the       American Veterinary Association re.
children and violence (Emily       Patterson-Kane).
In addition the research outcomes were deployed in       significant practitioner journals (eg Nursery World and Scholastic);       via training organisations (eg Pillars of Parenting) and opinion formers       (eg Battle         of Ideas X 2).
Widespread print-media exposure and national and       local radio invitations raised the profile of the research, including (in       REF period): Radio 1 Stories (Tempted by Teacher) 12.8.13; ESRC Britain in       2013; The Daily Record &amp; Sunday Mail 25.11.12; ESRC Society Now       Summer 2012; The Daily Telegraph 22.7.12; THE Campus Round Up 12.7.12;       Spiked online 3.7.12; Physical Education Matters Spring 2012; Radio 4       Woman's Hour 7.10.11; The Sentinel 10.9.11; BBC Radio Stoke 8.8.11; The       Sunday Times 22.5.11; Sec Ed 5.11.09; Spiked online 7.10.09; Radio 4       Woman's Hour interview 7.10.09; The Independent 20.09.09; Psychology Today       17.7.09; Nursery World 2 page feature 25.10.08; Manchester Evening News       feature 9,5.08; Channel M Television interview 29.2.08; Sheffield Star       Series feature 28.2.08; BBC Radio Berkshire interview 28.2.08; CRINMAIL       28.2.08; The Guardian (education online feature) 27.2.08; BBC Jon Gaunt       Show interview 27.2.08; Daily Mail feature 26.2.08; Child Rights       Information Network 25.02.08; Sunday Mail online feature 25.2.08; The       Independent feature 2.8.08.
Practice Impact:     Piper has been contacted by solicitors representing teachers who have       been accused of abuse to provide expert statements for court and LA       hearings.
A number of teachers in similar circumstances have also made       direct approaches requesting consultancy and expert advice.
Teachers'       organisations and campaign groups (NAS/UWT, FACT, Institute of Ideas) have       requested evidence that links practitioner experience in teaching and       childcare with wider policy debates around perceived risk and the vetting       of adults in contact with children, in order to support their advocacy of       positive change.
Others have drawn on the publications eg `This timely         book (Stronach &amp; Piper 2008) raises serious issues about how adults'         anxiety and self-protection can undermine the welfare of children.
The         authors ... place children's emotional well-being at the centre of the         discussion ...
The arguments support practitioners' Nursery World 		(Jennie Lindon, 03.07.08).
As the damaging trends in       policy and practice on which the research has been focussed are reversed,       beneficial impact effects individual teachers, care workers, coaches and       others acting in loco parentis.
Children and young people benefit       from more nurturing and humane intergenerational exchange.
Numerous       organisations (eg Local Authorities, sporting bodies) benefit in an       environment characterised more by prudent trust than all-embracing fear.
