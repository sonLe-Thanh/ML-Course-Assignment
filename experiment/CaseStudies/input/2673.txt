     4.1 UN agencies (UNDP-RBAS, UNESCO) and Anna Lindh Foundation     Sakr's research has influenced policy debate about Arab media development       by informing reports that were designed as tools for raising awareness       among policy makers and the public at large, and stimulating new thinking.
UNDP's Regional Bureau for Arab States (UNDP-RBAS) commissioned Sakr         in May 2008 to write a 50-page background paper on "The Impact of Media         Laws on Arab Digital and Print Content" for the Arab Knowledge           Report 2009.
The report's Chapter 2, on `Democratic Governance for         Human Development', cited Sakr's paper four times (pp 65-66) in relation         to restrictions on internet use, newspaper ownership and         self-censorship's detrimental effect on innovation.
Ch 2 underpinned the         report's `vision' and `plan', which urged Arab governments to reform         their media as part of political and institutional reform (pp 220-221).
UNESCO's 2013 Full Assessment of Media Development in Egypt,         which maps Egypt's media development needs for the benefit of local         state, corporate and civil society stakeholders seeking guidance on         media sector reform priorities, was revised to incorporate peer review         comments commissioned from Sakr, notably in relation to monopoly issues,         journalists' safety and the accountability of state bodies.
Sakr was         invited to comment on the revised report at a `validation' meeting         opened by Egypt's Minister of Information in Cairo on 7 March 2013.
Sakr was recruited by the Executive Director of the 43-member         intergovernmental Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation to: sit on         the editorial/'scientific' committee for the Foundation's Report on           Euro-Med Intercultural Trends 2010; coordinate the report's media         component; and write an overview chapter on media openness to         intercultural dialogue between Europe and the Southern and Eastern         Mediterranean.
Sakr advised on media questions (July 2009) for         the Gallup opinion poll conducted for the report and helped present         report findings to the press and public in Madrid (May 2010), Barcelona         (July 2010) and London (December 2010).
News media covered the report's         findings about misperceptions between different groups in the Euro-Med         region as pointers for Europe to engage more productively with its         southern and eastern neighbours.
4.2 Media Diversity Institute (MDI), London, and Institut Panos Paris         (IPP)     Sakr's research has informed overseas outreach and human rights education       by two NGOs.
Sakr was engaged by the Executive Director of London-based MDI to take         part in its `Reporting Diversity' Curriculum Development programmes,         which give Arab academics the opportunity under MDI mentoring to design         new modules promoting inclusive and responsible reporting for journalism         students.
Her template for a human rights module for journalists, first         presented at two pilot workshops in Cairo in November 2007, became a         fixture from 2009 in MDI workshops in Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia and         Lebanon, as practical testimony that minorities' and marginalised         groups' right to freedom from discriminatory reporting is basic to human         rights.
Through her mentoring of four academics in Egypt in 2009, three         in Morocco in 2010 and three in Egypt 2012-13, Sakr contributed to the         introduction of Reporting Diversity modules designed by mentees at Cairo         University Faculty of Mass Communication, Al-Azhar University in Egypt         and ISIC in Morocco.
IPP sought and took Sakr's advice on building its project team when         setting up its project on Public Service Broadcasting in the MENA Region         in 2009.
IPP's Director General also asked her in 2011 to write an         introductory chapter on public service broadcasting and democratisation         for the project's published report, which provides Arab decision-makers,         media professionals and NGOs with facts, figures and recommendations         conducive to reform of public broadcasting in support of democratisation         and freedom of expression.
Sakr was one of four panellists in IPP's         public debate in Marseille on 25 Nov 2012 (aired live by Radio Gazelle         and Gazelle TV) on `The Possibility of an Arab Media Spring', and         addressed a public audience in Beirut on 25 Jan 2013 as part of the         Lebanese American University's launch of the IPP report.
4.3 International Media Support (IMS), Copenhagen     Sakr's research fed into two periodic evaluations of IMS projects carried       out under the Danish-Arab Partnership Programme and informed its       subsequent programmes.
IMS, 90% funded by the Danish, Swedish and       Norwegian governments, supports free media as part of democratisation.
In July 2008 the IMS Programme Officer, prompted by a colleague who         had read Sakr's book Arab Television Today, invited her to join         a 4-person team, led by Development Associates of Copenhagen, to         evaluate IMS's performance in the Middle East during 2007-09 and present         findings to IMS and the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Copenhagen         in March 2009.
Sakr was assigned to focus on IMS collaborations with         journalists' unions and public broadcasters, its gender policy, its         strategic choices for targeting assistance, and the impact of IMS         projects.
In 2012 IMS invited Sakr to join the Evaluation Reference         Group, coordinated by the Evaluation Department of the Danish Ministry         of Foreign Affairs, to comment on a further evaluation, including at a         meeting in Cairo on 4 Feb 2013.
