     The long-term relationship between the University of Southampton and the       Chinese ministries has       enabled Southampton's research to make a significant impact on a) Chinese       health policies and       delivery of services; b) practitioners, professional services and health       systems; c) health and well-       being of Chinese men and women and (d) funding policies of international       donor agencies.
Impact on the Chinese government's reproductive health policies.
The Southampton-led evaluation of the UN pilot project in China       reinforced its credibility and       convinced the Chinese government to scale up, between 2008 and 2010, the       informed choices       model and roll it out across the country [5.1-5.2].
This policy       was implemented by China's National       Population and Family Planning Commission (NPFPC) and the Ministry of       Health (MoH).
The       Deputy Director General of NPFPC wrote in 2013 that "the research [from         Southampton] was         crucial in facilitating a high-level policy dialogue which eventually         led to expanding the informed         choices model of RH/FP services at the national level ...In this         context, the contributions from         Southampton and CPDRC team have been exemplary and unique in not only         generating quality         scientific evidence but also taking a proactive role in influencing         policy dialogue and programme         interventions" [5.1].
Administrative changes in the structure of the FP programme.
The       Southampton research       highlighted the need to integrate RH/FP services to improve efficiency and       quality of care.
This       recommendation has had a significant impact on the decision to merge the       NPFPC and MoH into       the National Health and Family Planning Commission [5.2].
Brought       to effect in March 2013, one of       the key strategies of the newly formed ministry is to reduce the overlap       and improve efficiency in       RH/FP service provision.
The UNFPA Representative in China commented in a       letter in May 2013       that "the logic and justification for integrating the two systems were         repeatedly stressed in the         recommendations of the independent research reports produced by the         University of Southampton         and team in China.
We believe that the integration of the Family         Planning and the Health systems         will enhance client-centred services and ensure better quality of care         in delivering high quality         reproductive health services for men and women in China" [5.2].
Impact on practice of service providers.
Between 2008 and 2009,       the NPFPC and the MoH       revised the in-service training modules to include, for the first time,       gender-based RH/FP       information, counselling, referral and treatment services for HIV/AIDS and       other STDs.
Acting on       recommendations made by the Southampton researchers, they amended       post-abortion care       guidelines to consider the individual RH/FP needs of women and couples to       ensure better quality       service provision without coercion or discrimination [5.1-5.2].
Enhanced training for grassroots FP       service providers was instituted, so that they could more effectively       communicate with women and       couples.
In a letter dated March 2013, the Deputy Director General of the       NPFPC confirms the       contribution of Southampton's research in changing protocols and staff       training as follows: "...the         research enabled us to identify areas for further intervention, and         reviewing the protocols for         gender-oriented service standards, staff training at different levels,         referral services and treatment         compliance" [5.1].
Similarly, Dr Arie Hoekman, in a letter       dated May 2013, states, "We have been         reassured by the research generated by the University of Southampton         that expanding         contraceptive choices through client-friendly services can positively         influence individual         reproductive health" [5.2].
Evidence collected by the research team in 2010 shows the benefit of this       improved practice and a       shift in attitudes among health providers.
Compared to the earlier period       in 2003, birth quotas in       the 2010 evaluation had been removed in 85% of the counties studied and       induced abortions fell       by an average of 43% (and up to 60% in more economically developed       regions) [3.6].
Knowledge       of RH/FP had increased among men and women (including awareness of       HIV/AIDS and STD       transmission routes) [3.4, 3.6].
Contraceptive choice was enhanced       and more women and couples       were making family planning decisions without being influenced by health       providers [3.4, 3.6, 5.1,         5.2].
Impact on health and wellbeing of individuals.
The extension of       the UN programme nation-wide,       which was a direct result of the findings from the Southampton-led       research, has meant that       754 million Chinese men and women of reproductive age (15-49) now have       access to family       planning methods of their choice without coercion or discrimination from       service providers.
The       policy changes, implemented by Chinese government ministries, have       improved the quality of life       of millions of Chinese men and women in 30 different provinces.
Their       cumulative impact at       population level is captured in the findings of the UNFPA China Sixth         Country Programme (2006-2010)         Quantitative Evaluation Report published in December       2011 (see 3.4).
The evaluation also       found that changes to the UN programme, as suggested by researchers'       earlier recommendations,       led to "a significant improvement in the overall quality of care in RH         services over the intervention         period" and "significant progress in client-centred quality FP service         delivery."
The evaluation also       discovered greater HIV/STI knowledge and an increased number of       youth-friendly services.
Further recommendations from the earlier research to have a special focus       on young people,       gender and HIV prevention were adopted in the Sixth programme (2006-2010).
The shift towards client-centred RH/FP services enabled, in particular,       young women and men to       access RH/FP services, irrespective of age or marital status.
Evidence of       the impact at population       level was seen from the Sixth programme (2006-2010) evaluation report,       where rates of reported       condom use among young married adults more than doubled and induced       abortion rates fell       significantly [3.4, 3.6].
Further recommendations made by the       Southampton team to increase the       use of youth friendly sexual and reproductive health services &#8212; especially       among men who were       reluctant to seek services &#8212; have been fed into the Seventh Country       Programme (2010-2014)       which focuses on sustainable population development polices [5.2].
Impact on funding policies of the international community.
The       Southampton-led evaluation of       the earlier UN programmes gave the UN the credibility it required to       reassure 10 European       countries and Australia of the programme's effectiveness and led to the       continuation of       international funding for its work in China to the present date [5.2].
The UNFPA Representative in       China, Dr Arie Hoekman, wrote in May 2013, "the research [led by the         Southampton team]         generated wider interest and facilitated a national level response         across China.
In addition, the         donor countries and relevant stakeholders were convinced of the UN         programme impact in China         which led to subsequent funding of the Fifth and Sixth cycles of the         country programme" [5.2].
The       validity of the results from three successive evaluation rounds,       underpinned by high quality data       and scientific publications in peer-reviewed international journals, was       instrumental in convincing       the Chinese government to scale up the programme nationwide, using an       informed choices model       [5.1].
The research has had an impact beyond China.
The tools developed by       Southampton for the UN       programme were replicated in a similar programme in North Korea, involving       researchers from the       China Population and Development Research Centre.
In July 2012, a member       of the UK       Department for International Development's Health Advisory Committee,       having read the Sixth       Country Programme report, invited Padmadas to discuss the population       impact of the UN       programme in China in order to examine whether lessons from China could be       adopted for the       DFID RH/FP programmes in Africa, in countries such as Sierra Leone and       Rwanda.
In February       2013, Padmadas was invited by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on       Population, Development       and Reproductive Health to a dialogue on China's Family Planning and       Reproductive Health and       Rights with representatives from British Parliament and NGOs including the       UNFPA.
