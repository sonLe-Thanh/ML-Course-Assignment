     Impacts on commerce       By August 2013, there were over 1000 registered installations of CcpNmr       Analysis, with 356       registered users on the CcpNmr Users mail feed (the exact number of end       users is difficult to       quantify given that an important contribution of CCPN lies in the       improvement and integration of       programs from other sources).
A 2012 user survey by CCPN gave a       distribution of 23% UK, 34%       North American, 34% European, and 10% `other' installations, with an       average number of users       per installation of over 4 (corresponding to several thousand users).
By       mid-2013, the following       companies were registered as paying subscribers: Astra Zeneca, Astex,       Genentech7, Novartis8,       Novo-Nordisk9, Syngenta10, and Vernalis11,       yielding an annual total fee income of &#163;43,500.
All fee       income is directly reinvested in the project.
Commercial users of CcpNmr       Analysis benefit from       faster drug development times and lower development costs.
For example:            `we [Genentech] find it very beneficial to our company.
We         particularly appreciate the data         model that has been developed and incorporated into the `Analysis' and         `Format Converter'         software packages for the efficient visualization and assignment of NMR         spectra.
These         features greatly facilitate the structural characterization of protein         and protein-ligand         interactions'7        `we [Novartis] use the CCPN software for the purpose of visualizing         and analysing         multidimensional NMR data of proteins, assignment of proteins and         chemical shift mapping.
These are critical features ... the CcpNmr software is absolutely         crucial for our work'8        `The open nature of the software facilitates the integration of the         software into our workflow         and thus allows us [Novo Nordisk] to spend more of our time tackling the         problem at hand'9        `Syngenta uses the CCPN software for discovering and ensuring the         safety of new plant         protection products.
I find it very beneficial to my work and         particularly appreciate the         contribution CCPN has made to simplify the transfer of NMR data between         software         packages'10        `CCPN provides an invaluable NMR data analysis platform which is         crucial to our research         [at Vernalis]; at present, no other software package is available which         meets our         requirements.
We feel that this software greatly enhances our         productivity'11           In addition, CCPN has a special collaboration with Novartis, which       involves Novartis registering as       a premium member of CCPN (at an additional charge of &#163;14,000), and CCPN       developing       customized software now being used by the company in structure-based drug       design by NMR.8     Impacts on practitioners: working protocols have been changed; quality         has been improved       Much CCPN code is distributed under the LGPL license, allowing free       copying and reuse.
As a       result, the number of practitioners (NMR users) impacted is substantial,       and crosses a wide range       of sectors; NMR is a commonly used tool for companies working in, for       example, the       pharmaceutical, chemical, agro-chemical and petroleum sectors.
The CCPN data model has been chosen to underpin various international NMR       software       integration efforts, facilitating change in working protocols for NMR       software in commercial and       academic laboratories worldwide.
The Laue group (as CCPN) coordinated the       Extend-NMR project       (European 6th Framework Programme), a collaboration of European       software developers to       develop an integrated software pipeline to support functional and       structural proteomics.
The CCPN       data model and CcpNmr FormatConverter were chosen by the eNMR project (7th       Framework       Programme), as the main tool to exchange data between programs in its       development of a Grid-based       platform for computationally intensive calculations used during       biomolecular NMR data       analysis.
This led to a larger integration effort, the WeNMR project (7th       Framework Programme,       currently under way), which "aims to bring together complementary         research teams in the         structural biology and life science area into a virtual research         community at a worldwide level and         provide them with a platform integrating and streamlining the         computational approaches necessary         for NMR and SAXS data analysis and structural modelling".
WeNMR       links the software pipelines       developed in Extend-NMR to the web servers for NMR calculations developed       in eNMR and now       running on the Grid, and opted to use the CCPN data model as its central       data conversion utility.
As a result of these integration projects, there has been a significant       benefit to commercial users.
For example: `We [Novo Nordisk] particularly appreciate the easy         integration with other NMR         related software packages, which allows us to switch between different         structure calculation         programs with ease and use the most appropriate tool for each project.
'9     The universal appeal and easy expandability of the CCPN data model has       led to it being adopted       by various NMR databases and programmes used by industry and academia, for       example, the       NMR part of the EUROCarb database12.
Programs in the NMR field       that have been integrated with       the CCPN data model from the Extend-NMR collaboration include: MDD,       PRODECOMP, and       Bruker's TOPSPIN (NMR processing); ARIA, HADDOCK, and ISD (structure       generation); and       CING (structure validation).
Other programs that have been integrated       include: PALES and       MODULE (data analysis and assignment); MECCANO (structure generation); RPF       (structure validation); and ECI (database deposition).
Programs like DANGLE       (structure estimation from       chemical shifts) and MARS (automatic backbone assignment) have been       further integrated to use       CcpNmr Analysis as a front end to prepare data.
A further recent example       is the CASPER program       for determination of polysaccharide structures from NMR data13.
The CCPN software has also been applied to projects beyond studies of       macromolecular structure       and dynamics, e.g.
metabolomics14 and fragment-based small       molecule screening.
For example,       Vernalis has stated that the CCPN software `facilitates our approach of         fragment-based lead         discovery'11.
The company is currently collaborating with       CCPN on the development and testing of       a module for NMR-based ligand screening, to improve productivity in       identifying low-affinity ligands       using NMR, and to which the company is inputting expertise and datasets11.
A significant long-term impact of CCPN on the worldwide NMR user       community has been on the       quality and quantity of data available15,16,17,18.
The data       model has facilitated the deposition of much       more complete NMR datasets in the public databases such as the PDBe       (Protein Data Bank in       Europe) and BioMagResBank (the publically-accessible international       repository of NMR data,       University of Wisconsin-Madison).
The CCPN software is also making it       possible to recalculate       results (and thus improve their quality) as new and improved algorithms       are developed.
Resulting       recalculated NMR structures are available in the RECOORD and logRECOORD       databases.
