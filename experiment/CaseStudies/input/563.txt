     The UN Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) has responsibility within the UN       system for advising on and proposing integrated strategies for       post-conflict peacebuilding and recovery.
Caplan's scholarship [R2,         R4] and his research project on exit strategies came to the       attention of the Peacebuilding Support Office (PBSO), the Secretariat of       the PBC, in 2007 and was subsequently circulated widely within the PBSO       and across the UN system [C1].
The PBSO asked Caplan to draw on       and extend his previous research to understand how they might better       support the transition of a peace operation as it moves from initial       stabilization towards consolidation.
It was interested specifically in       research that might assist it in making recommendations to the Commission       on when to `graduate' a country on its agenda.
(1) Identifying operational challenges to UN transitional           strategies       Building on his research insights [R2], Caplan produced a study       for the PBSO, published as an inter-agency briefing paper in March 2008,       which demonstrated:            a lack of conceptual clarity within the UN system with regard to         `peace consolidation,' `transition' and `exit strategies' and other key         concepts;       the absence of agreed-upon criteria with respect to gauging the         achievement of a peace operation's principal objectives;       the absence of system-wide country monitoring methodologies to inform         UN planning; the inappropriate use of benchmarking to chart progress         towards consolidated peace within countries;       limited planning capacity within and between some UN agencies to         support sequencing and transition and a lack of adequate structures to         share information and plan jointly;       lack of broad knowledge in the UN system concerning the actual         experience of transition and exit; and       structural and political factors inhibiting the emergence of effective         strategies to support transition, including uncertainty with regard to         the time and resources available, making it difficult to develop sound         strategic plans [C2].
Caplan presented the initial findings of his research to the UN       Peacebuilding Commission in New York on 17 December 2007.
This briefing       was the first time an academic had been invited to address the PBC.
Caplan       also presented his findings at a UN inter-agency seminar in New York on 20       December 2007 attended by representatives of the Department of       Peacekeeping Operations, the Department of Political Affairs, the UN       Development Programme, and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for       Refugees.
At the request of the Permanent Representative of Japan to the       United Nations, Caplan discussed the findings of his research with       representatives of Member States invited to the Japanese Mission on 18       December 2007.
(The chair of the PBSO was Japan's representative to the       UN.)
The briefing paper formed the basis of an extensive UN Peacebuilding       Community of Practice (CoP) e-discussion on peace consolidation metrics       conducted in April and May 2008 that circulated to some 450 practitioners       in 20 UN agencies and departments.
The consultation was widely welcomed by       participants and summaries show that the ideas for benchmarking of peace       consolidation as set out in Caplan's briefing paper were considered for       the most part both desirable and feasible [C3].
(2) Defining an approach to UN benchmarking and the need for a           handbook       Thirty-five percent of all violent conflicts re-ignite within five years       of a negotiated peace.
To respond to the fragility of the peace process,       Caplan's briefing paper recommended the production of a UN practitioners'       guide to benchmarking.
By promoting more rigorous and systematic       assessment of progress towards a consolidated peace Caplan argued that       peacebuilding efforts could be recalibrated without jeopardising the       peace.
Drawing on his research [R2, R4], Caplan recommended that a       practitioners' guide to benchmarking should:            define key terms and offer broad-based criteria for measuring peace         consolidation;       present a Comprehensive Peace Consolidation Monitoring Matrix with         detailed benchmarking and indicative examples;       share the positive and negative lessons derived from benchmarking         exercises in UN peacebuilding operations;       make practical recommendations on the technical and financial         resources necessary for tracking progress across multiple sectors,         including critical national capacity gaps;       provide comparative country examples about the multiple factors that         can determine the pace of change towards a national environment         conducive to peace consolidation;       strengthen the UN's capacity for practical guidance to nationally led         and UN-supported Monitoring and Tracking Mechanisms.
The briefing paper's recommendation for a handbook was adopted by the       PBC's Organizational Committee in June 2008 and a PBSO-sponsored UN Peace       Consolidation Benchmarking Experts workshop was held in New York in       November 2008.
The background paper produced by the UN for the workshop       explicitly acknowledges the genesis of the handbook project in Caplan's       briefing paper, in its reference to the Measuring Peace Consolidation         and Supporting Transition briefing paper that informed this study       and the wider peace consolidation benchmarking project [C4].
In 2010, the United Nations, in cooperation with the Fafo Institute for       Applied International Studies and the Norwegian Peacebuilding Centre,       published Monitoring Peace Consolidation: United Nations       Practitioners' Guide to Benchmarking [C5].The contribution of       Caplan's briefing paper is again acknowledged&#8212;both directly and       indirectly&#8212;through the verbatim and paraphrased use of portions of the       briefing paper in the guide [C6].
(3) Integrating benchmarking and the use of the handbook within UN           policy and practice       Efforts have been under way since 2010 to integrate the guidance into UN       practice.
These include use in regional training workshops and discussions       within PBSO about further development of benchmarking procedures and       systems.
In December 2012 Caplan was consulted by personnel of the UN       Department of Peacekeeping Operations regarding the preparation of a       concept note that led to the adoption by the UN Secretary-General of a       `Policy on UN Transitions in the Context of Mission Drawdown or       Withdrawal' in February 2013.
The Policy affirms several key principles of       sound management of transitions that were articulated in Caplan's study [C2],       notably early planning, UN integration, national ownership and national       capacity development [C7].
In February 2013 Caplan was invited by       the PBSO to undertake further research into political, social and economic       indicators of a stable peace in post-conflict settings to assist with       strengthening the development of UN benchmarking practices [C8].
Peacebuilding is an increasingly important component of strategy within       the international community, but it is a complex and often fraught       process.
Caplan's research has helped UN institutions develop more       systematic criteria for evaluating progress on the road to peace.
