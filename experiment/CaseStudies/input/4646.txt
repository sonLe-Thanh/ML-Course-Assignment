     Globally, the nuclear power industry produces about 14% of all       electricity, which equates to 6% of       all power in a sector worth hundreds of billions of pounds.
There are now       over 430 commercial       nuclear power reactors operating in 31 countries, with 372 GW of total       capacity [d].
Waste       management from this industry is of high economic and social concern, with       considerable       emphasis and scrutiny on safety and longevity of sites.
Of arguably       greater social value and       scrutiny is the safe storage and maintenance of the UK's nuclear       deterrent.
Regardless of the civil       or military setting, the occurrence of a storage incident is likely to       have significant national and       international impact, environmentally, economically and socially.
The work       of Scott and others at       the IAC is part of the effort to make uranium storage safer and better       understood in terms of       reactive chemistry.
Through collaboration with CERN, Sellafield and the AWE, the IAC has       broad reach, connecting       with national and international partners.
Research efforts [1-6]       have translated detailed, focused       scientific work into tangible outputs and counsel for the nuclear       industry, consequently playing a       critical part in energy policy.
Indirect beneficiaries include other EU       research facilities such as "the         SPIRAL2 project at GANIL, Caen, France and the SPES project at INFN,         Italy" [c], as well as the       UK public and the US public through trans-Atlantic sharing of information       between AWE and the       Department of Defence.
Impact, as a pull-through, is garnered through the       uptake of advice and       change to protocols, be it from changing the way uranium (and associated       compounds and       products) are stored or processed, through to improved understanding of       the reactive chemistry of       uranium in different possible storage environments.
Further detail of the       impact provided to direct       beneficiaries is provided below:     Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE)       The UK's "current nuclear weapons capability costs on average around         5-6 per cent of the current         defence budget" [d], equivalent to approximately &#163;2-&#163;2.4       billion.
To date, research has been       primarily focused on determining the factors influencing the initiation of       hydrogen corrosion on       uranium surfaces.
This research has had a direct feed-through to the safe       storage of uranium and       associated materials within the MoD estate, considered to account for a       significant proportion of       the operational cost of Trident and the cost of running Aldermaston (AWE       expenditure between       2008 and 2011 is about &#163;2.6 billion) [e].
Over the past 9 years,       extensive experience and valuable       data relating to the corrosion of uranium metal have been accumulated by       the Bristol group; "This         knowledge has furthered our understanding of some uranium corrosion         processes (particularly the         reaction between uranium and hydrogen) and helped to validate and         quantify some important         predictive uranium corrosion models developed at AWE" [a].
For example, the fundamental       relationship between oxide thickness and the severity of hydride attack,       which is an underlying       mechanistic assumption within several corrosion models applied at the AWE,       was directly verified       by Bristol in a 2006 technical report [a].
The use of such models       enables corrosion predictions       which are used unequivocally to reduce the need for physical examination,       intervention and       measurements of stored materials, all of which account for a heavy       financial burden on the UK       Government [a].
The AWE are strongly voiced in their opinion that       the "contribution to the AWE         [from Bristol], and by association the UK, has been significant and much         needed" [a].
Sellafield Ltd       One of the key unanswered questions pertaining to the state of uranium in       storage at Sellafield is       the safe retrieval and treatment of the legacy wastes.
"It is         considered that ongoing research with         Dr Scott will allow us, in conjunction with other programmes of work, to         better predict the current         state and residual reactivity of uranium and reactive metal bearing         wastes across a number of the         legacy plants on the Sellafield site.
This has a direct bearing on UK         national level programmes for         the safe and cost effective remediation of the Sellafield site" [b],       which was valued at &#163;67.5 billion       in February 2013 [f].
Scott has recommended that spent uranium       fuel should be stored in a semidry       and open containment system, such that the potential for significant       hydrogen accumulation is       prevented; Sellafield is currently manufacturing test storage casks, to       provide a full-scale       demonstration of such a storage concept, and is investing approximately       &#163;500,000 in this project       [g].
Bristol's research on hydride formation has affected the       Sellafield safety case for recovery of       legacy wastes by reducing uncertainty in quantifying the risk associated       with the occurrence of       thermal excursions.
It has also helped to confirm that there is not a       significant safety issue posed       by uranium hydride in the recovery of legacy waste from Sellafield storage       silos.
Sellafield is now       continuing with the Magnox Swarf Storage Silos (&#163;387 million) and other       legacy retrieval projects,       including the silos direct encapsulation plant (&#163;1.28 billion) and pile       fuel cladding silo project (&#163;341       million), projects worth a total of ~&#163;1.9 billion [f,h].
This work       on encapsulation of uranium metal in       cement (using synchrotron X-rays) has proven that hydride can be a       developing corrosion product;       Sellafield will use this information to inform its safety case for waste       encapsulation [a].
Although       the research relationship between Bristol and Sellafield is relatively       new, the technical input       provided to date has had "a positive influence on several Sellafield         programmes which predate the         formation of the link providing...valuable supporting data and expert         advice that have reinforced         and influenced decisions relating to waste retrieval and treatment         programmes" [b].
CERN (ISOLDE Facility)       The safe disposal of radioactive waste arising from experimental fission       studies at CERN is a key       objective for the organisation; "As a by-product of our experimental         activities at the ISOLDE on-line         isotope mass separator facility, the site has a stockpile of spent         uranium and thorium carbide         targets from which we have produced fission product gases...These wastes         have historically been         stored on site and have gradually accumulated, awaiting the development         of a suitable processing         route for conversion of the material into a waste form that is         acceptable to the Swiss authorities"       [c].
In 2010, work presented by Scott [3], instigated CERN       funding a 2-year research project to       develop a process for the controlled chemical conversion of their uranium       carbide fission targets       into an acceptable waste form.
Scott's research has solved this specific       problem; "It is considered         that the work conducted by Dr Scott and his team has allowed us to         develop and implement (from         scratch) a processing route for our radioactive fission target wastes.
This has had a direct and         positive bearing on the operations at the ISOLDE facility and at CERN in         general" [c].
This method       for processing ISOLDE fission wastes has "constituted the building of         a specialist hot-cell facility         for handling waste targets and a gas treatment system for converting the         targets.
This investment         was in the order of 1.4 million Euros" [c].
