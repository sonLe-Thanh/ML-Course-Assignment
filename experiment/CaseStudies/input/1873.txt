     Professor Delgado has perhaps more than anyone in recent years had a       profound influence on the perceptions of people in Britain on Spanish       theatre.
She has widened our perspective and deepened our knowledge of       Spanish writers, playwrights, directors and theatre practice.
&#8212; Sir       Brian McMaster, Advisor to the Cultural Olympiad (2012), author of       `McMaster Review: Supporting excellence in the arts &#8212; from measurement to       judgement' (DCMS, 2008), former Director of the Edinburgh International       Festival (1992-2006)     Delgado's research in theatrical and screen cultures has generated a body       of knowledge that has led to impact in three key areas.
I.
Opening up public discourse     I've always appreciated Mar&#237;a's insight regarding theatre matters, and         especially her advice to me during my time as Director of the Grec         Festival in Barcelona [2006-11].
Her reviews, comments and perceptions         about the international scene resulted in my inviting many highly         appreciated artists to present their work in our programmes.
&#8212;       Ricardo Szwarcer, Director of Usina del Arte, Buenos Aires (2012)     Delgado has made 30+ BBC radio appearances to discuss Spanish and       Latin-American stage and screen culture across six different programmes: The         Strand (World Service); Open Book, Saturday Review,       Start the Week, The Film Programme (Radio4); and NightWaves       (Radio3).
She is also a frequent reviewer and contributor to mass media       and trade publications, such as Sight &amp; Sound (five exclusive       interviews and features, 12 film and book reviews and 13 commentaries); Plays         International [PI] (12 reviews); and Western European         Stages (11 reviews).
All are key industry publications with an       extensive readership; for example, Sight &amp; Sound's estimated       monthly readership is 45,000; PI's subscription base includes       Steppenwolf Chicago and Market Theatre Johannesburg.
Her work has further       been cited in 50+ Spanish-language news outlets, including Deia, El       Pa&#237;s, P&#225;gina 12 and Diario de Sevilla.
This work raises the profile of Spanish-language theatre productions,       disseminates knowledge about new working practices, and attracts new       audiences.
For example: in 2013 a film she championed for Sight &amp;       Sound's `Hidden Gems' feature (Aug. 2007), Cr&#237;a cuervos/Raise       Ravens, was re-released by the BFI, Delgado was invited to chair       the interview       with its director Carlos Saura       at the BFI, London (11 June 2011), and she contributed a 2,000 word essay       to the 2013 DVD release.
In another case, a review of Lake Tahoe       first published in Sight &amp; Sound, was reproduced in the DVD       release notes (Yume Pictures, 2009).
Delgado has conducted public interviews with more than 50 major cultural       figures from Spain and Spanish-America since 2008, including Pedro       Almod&#243;var and Pen&#233;lope Cruz, Javier       Bardem, Alfredo Castro, Benicio del Toro, Diego Luna, and Alejandro       Gonz&#225;lez I&#241;&#225;rritu.
Over 4,000 audience members have viewed these       interviews live or online and feedback indicates audiences' enhanced       appreciation of the films.
Three of the interviews have also been       disseminated as commentaries on DVD film releases: Tony Manero       (dir.
Pablo Larra&#237;n, Network, 2009); Abel (dir.
Diego Luna,       Network, 2011); Cr&#237;a cuervos (BFI Releasing, 2013).
In 2012 Delgado hosted Almod&#243;var's David       Lean Lecture for BAFTA, contributing to the online edit and       undertaking a further BAFTA       interview on casting and the craft of filmmaking.
She participated       in the 2012       Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Almod&#243;var tribute with a       public interview and conducted the only public       Q&amp;A for the 2013 UK premiere of Almod&#243;var's I'm So Excited!,       presented across 40+ UK cinemas in a live stream.
She briefed and advised       the producer of BBC One's The Graham Norton Show prior to       Almod&#243;var's appearance (26 April 2013, audience of 4 million).
All these       events have served to enhance public and industry understandings of the       working practices of Spain's leading filmmaker.
II.
Improving the programming and circulation of Spanish-language       theatre and film     Delgado's publications have been hugely influential in shaping my       programming.
Feedback from audiences confirms that her Q&amp;As have       genuinely enhanced their appreciation of the films.

Delgado's influence on cultural programming &#8212; through working with       cultural organisations, as well as through the dissemination of her ideas       and analysis as detailed in the previous section &#8212; has led to wider       cultural awareness of Hispanic film and theatre and increased economic       prosperity through ticket sales.
From 2008-12, Delgado worked as an advisor to the BFI London Film       Festival, programming 67 Spanish-language films attracting audiences of       21,856 and generating &#163;193,525.50 from ticket sales.
Of these films, 9       have secured UK releases, generating cinematic box-office and DVD sales.
In 2009, Tristana Media invited Delgado to select the films for the       `Lorca on Film' season at London's Cine Lumi&#232;re, 27-30 March 2009.
The       season attracted an audience of 607 attending the six screenings, with       three public Q&amp;As chaired by Delgado.
The accompanying `Lorca on Film'       website had 3,329 visitors between Feb. and May 2009.
The National       Galleries of Scotland requested the double-bill programme of Un Chien         andalou and Trip to the Moon as part of a `Lorca on Film and       Surrealism' event on 8 July 2010.
In August 2010, Delgado co-programmed a `South American Renaissance'       season at the BFI, London, showing 21 films over 47 screenings, and       drawing audiences of 2,941.
Building on the success of the `Lorca on Film' season, Tristana Media       invited Delgado to curate two programmes of films on acting in Spain,       `Acting Across Frontiers' (2012-13), again at the Cin&#233; Lumi&#232;re, for the  	  London Spanish Film       Festival.
The first, `Acting Almod&#243;var' (29 Sept. &#8212; 2 Oct. 2012),       comprised five screenings, an onstage conversation between actors Marisa       Paredes and Antonia San Juan and Delgado, and three Q&amp;As attracting       audiences of 441.
The accompanying web pages attracted 76,000 page views       between Aug. and Oct. 2012.
Delgado was also commissioned to write an       essay on Almod&#243;var's work for Latino Life, the UK's largest       Latin and Spanish lifestyle portal which attracts over 30,000 visits a       week.
The subsequent `Acting on Both Sides of the Atlantic' season (25-28       April 2013) picked up on transnational currents in Spanish cinema,       presenting six linked films and three onstage interviews with actors Juan       Diego and Mar&#237;a Botto, Blanca Su&#225;rez and Carlos Areces, and Oscar-winning       director Fernando Trueba with audiences of 831.
Press coverage includes       features in El Pa&#237;s (10/09/12), Living Spain (Autumn       2012), RTVE (28/09/12).
The London Spanish Film Festival website       hosts videos       from both seasons.
In 2012, Sof&#237;a Serbin de Skalon, a publicist with over 10 years       experience in the international film industry, invited Delgado to       collaborate as a programming associate on a new Argentine Film Festival in       London, with the aim of establishing a showcase for the best contemporary       films from and about Argentina, as well as providing Londoners with a       unique insight into Argentine culture.
Its two editions have screened 19       features and 20 shorts across 4 venues (Ritzy Cinema 2012, 2013; Cineworld       Haymarket, Hackney Picturehouse 2013) attracting audiences of c.1,600       in 2012 and c.1,800 in 2013.
The festival has been well-covered by       press both in the UK and Latin America with outlets including Evening       Standard, Financial Times, Guardian, Independent, Huffington Post,       Monacle24, Screen Daily, Time Out (Pick of the Week 2013 edition),       and La Naci&#243;n (Argentina).
The       festival website received over 8,000 unique visitors in the 6 months       (Feb-July 2012) following its launch and 8,000 unique visitors in April       2013 alone, with an overall digital reach of 60 million in online       newspaper and magazine coverage in 2013.
This activity shows how Delgado is actively bringing Spanish-language       films to UK audiences.
Many of the films selected for festival screenings       are not otherwise available in the cinema, and were previously unknown       outside the Spanish-speaking world.
III.
Contributing creative and economic prosperity through consultancy       and advocacy in the creative industries in the UK, Spain and Argentina     Delgado is one of the key drivers of our theatre in the UK       &amp;madsh; Marcos Ord&#243;&#241;ez, El Pa&#237;s (14/6/12)     Cultural organisations and directors in the UK, Spain and Argentina have       solicited Delgado's advice on the staging of plays, or sought her       knowledge of key figures in contemporary Hispanic theatre.
She has       consulted for The Globe London, Grec Festival Barcelona, Teatre Lliure       Barce-lona, and Teatro El Extranjero Buenos Aires.
Two examples of       consultation work are detailed here.
Her documenting of Lorca's relationship with his lead actress Margarita       Xirgu fed into Peter Sellars' production of Osvaldo Golijov's opera Ainadamar       (Barbican Centre, 2008, Teatro Real Madrid, 2012), with Delgado providing       a programme note for the 2008 staging and advising on the revisions to the       libretto for 2012.
Her contribution was recognised by Sellars in his       comment that the production `owes its very existence to the weight and       depth of Maria Delgado's work'.
Bijan Sheibani (Associate Director of the National Theatre) drew on       Delgado's Federico Garc&#237;a Lorca (2008) in staging The House of       Bernarda Alba (opened Almeida Theatre, London 19 Jan. 2012).
Delgado advised on the choice of translation and the re-situating of the       play from 1930s Andalusia to contemporary Iran and provided a programme       note.
The 77 press reviews, preview features and recommendations published       in the UK, USA and Spain commented on the `inspired' resituating of the       play (Evening Standard, 2/2/12; Independent 4/2/12; The       Times, 30/1/12), its `clarity' (Guardian 28/1/12) and a       `thrilling staging, eloquent and justified' (Time Out, 31/1/12).
The production played at 93.6% capacity over 54 performances (16,582       spectators).
Delgado has further advised Sheibani on Tirso de Molina's Damned         by Despair at the National Theatre (Olivier auditorium, opened       11/10/12), providing research materials, discussing ideas about `this       challenging work' (Guardian 12/10/12) and the Golden Age stage,       authoring a programme note (`weighty essay' Daily Express       12/10/12) and providing detailed feedback in preview.
The production was       seen by 29,972 people, reviewed in 26 print and 5 online publications (`a       damned interesting way to spend an evening', Daily Telegraph       12/10/12), and generated 24 preview pieces including `Hot tickets in       London' (NYTimes.com) and `Theatre pick' (Financial Times).
