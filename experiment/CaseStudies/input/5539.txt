     The research makes a contribution to policy and practice for all Pyramid       club stakeholders.
These stakeholders include: Pyramid at the University       of West London (part of the ContinYou community learning       organisation until June 2013); local authority commissioners; funding       bodies; schools; Pyramid club leaders; and the children themselves, and       their families (service users).
Pyramid uses the team's research to support its programme management and       communication with stakeholders e.g.
providing decision-making information       for local authority service commissioners, funding bodies, and other       professionals e.g.
social workers, teachers, educational psychologists.
A       lay summary of the Pyramid evaluation research is included in a guide for       donors and charities in the area of children's and young people's mental       health (New Philanthropy Capital [NPC], 2008).
NPC, `a consultancy and         think tank dedicated to helping funders and charities achieve a greater         impact' (NPC, 2008), uses the research to support anecdotal and       qualitative evidence of the beneficial effects of Pyramid Club attendance.
Similarly, the work has been cited (Cassidy, 2009) in the peer-reviewed       journal &#8212; Social Psychology of Education.
The research findings were also important to schools in demonstrating       that they were adopting evidence-based practice to contribute to       Government initiatives such as Every Child Matters (DfES, 2003), Targeted       Mental Health in Schools (TAMHS), and the Healthy School Standard (Health       Development Agency, 2004).
Pyramid stakeholders also include undergraduate       volunteers who gain transferable employability skills, and schools support       staff such as Teaching Assistants who enhance their practice by training       to deliver an evidence-based intervention within the primary school       system.
During the REF assessment period, the number of children who attended a       Pyramid club peaked in the 2009/10 academic year at approximately 6,300       children.
Through the commissioning process, the availability of a strong       evidence-base arising from our research will assist growth of the number       of Pyramid clubs operating and the number of children who can attend.
The research has also stimulated research interest in Pyramid, in other     Higher Education Institutions for example the work of McKenna, Cassidy and     Giles (2013) at the University of Ulster.
The research evaluations of Pyramid have supported successful funding       bids to the following organisations which, in turn, have benefited and       continue to benefit Pyramid's service users:            The John Lyons's Charity (&#163;72,000), Development of the Transition         Project, London Borough of Ealing (2009).
The John Lyons's Charity (&#163;90,000), Rollout of the Pyramid project in         the London Boroughs of Ealing, Brent, Westminster and Harrow (2013).
John Laing (&#163;24,000), Development of the Pyramid model and new         materials to extend the reach to young people aged 11-14 in secondary         schools (2011).
Santander (&#163;9,000), funding for a pilot multi-disciplinary project in         Bradford, bringing together schools, Children's Centre and youth workers         (2012-13).
