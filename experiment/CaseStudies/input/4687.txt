     There are two aspects to Wells' impact in this case study.
The first       concerns Wells' critique of the       draft Bribery Bill 2009, which led to major changes in the formulation of       the corporate offence.
In       itself this had international reach and significance as the offence       affects multinational commercial       organisations.
The second impact, drawing additionally on her broader work       on corporate criminal       liability has led to her having a major influence on the work of the OECD       and International Bar       Association.
1.
Direct impact on Bribery Act 2010     Wells' potent combination of detailed critique of the corporate offence       in the draft Bill, together with       recognition that the UK not seen as compliant by the OECD, prompted major       substantive       amendments to the Bill by means of a direct, linear change in the Bribery       Act 2010.
The scale and       significance of the amendments can be shown by comparing cl.5(1) of the       original draft Bill and       s.7(1) as it became:     Cl.5(1): A ... commercial organisation ("C") is guilty ... under this       section if &#8212; (a) a person       ("A") performing services for or on behalf of C bribes another person, (b)       the bribe was in       connection with C's business, and (c) a responsible person, or a number of       such persons       taken together, was negligent in failing to prevent the bribe.
S.7(1): A ... commercial organisation ("C") is guilty of an offence ...       if a person ("A")       associated with C bribes another person intending &#8212; (a) to obtain or       retain business for C, or       (b) to obtain or retain an advantage in the conduct of business for C     These significant changes came about as a result of Wells' written and       oral evidence (in May.2009)       before the joint House of Commons/House of Lords legislative Scrutiny       Committee, which she was       invited to give because of her national and international expertise in the       field [a].
She used [3] to       argue that the corporate liability provision in the Bill was unnecessarily       restrictive and complex; did       not comply with the OECD convention; and unusually required both negligent       failure to supervise       and a lack of procedural due diligence ([a], Q115).
The Committee noted that Wells had "... played your role already         behind the scenes in getting this         legislation into a draft form" ([a], Q75).
She went on to play a       further decisive role "behind closed       doors", when the Committee raised a further query by way of supplementary       question asking       whether "removing the requirement to prove negligence under clause 5 would       be unfair to       businesses and mark a step change from any comparable criminal offence (Qq       61-64).?
Wells       responded that "... the debate about corporate liability starts from         the wrong foot or premise.
A         company's liability for the acts of its employees is appropriate &#8212; and         this is particularly applicable in         the bribery context &#8212; because those acts benefit the company, those acts         are undertaken with         company resources (where does the money for the bribe come from?
who         signs the contracts?
where do the profits end up?
The answer in each case is `the business')         and companies are         peculiarly equipped to supervise and monitor the acts of their employees         and agents" [i].
The Committee accepted her arguments, noting "we are concerned by the         focus on whether a         `responsible person' was negligent, rather than on the collective         failure of the company to ensure         that adequate anti-bribery procedures were in place.
In our view,         clauses 5 and 6 introduce a         narrow and complex solution to a pressing problem.
We therefore         recommend the removal of the         need to prove negligence under clause 5(1)(c)" [a], para 89.
In       adopting the Committee's       suggestions, the Government agreed "that there may be a risk that         requiring the prosecution to         prove negligence may involve unnecessary complexity and may have the         potential to undermine         the broad policy objectives of bringing about a shift away from a         corporate culture that is more         tolerant of bribery and promoting effective corporate anti-bribery         procedures" [h], para 9.
The       requirement to prove negligence was removed.
Thus, there was a comprehensive re-drafting of the relevant provision       which, subject to an       adequate procedures defence, renders corporations liable for bribery       offences by their employees       and agents.
Lord Goodhart, a member of that Committee, made the following       observation       regarding Wells' contribution in the oral hearing ([a], Q112):     I found Professor Wells' suggestion on how to deal with corporate         offences very         persuasive, namely that there should be vicarious liability with the         company being liable for         any bribery committed by anybody acting on their behalf with a due         diligence defence...'.
The final report of the Joint Committee includes numerous citations to       Wells' evidence ([a]) and its       recommendations, particularly as regards the corporate bribery offence,       drew heavily on Wells'       evidence (eg at paras 41, 89-90, 103, 138).
The final provisions of the       Act therefore owe a       considerable debt to Wells' research as they reflect her specific critique       and brought the UK into       line with the OECD Convention as she had suggested.
For example, Monty       Raphael QC, General       Counsel, Peters &amp; Peters, who also gave oral evidence to the       Committee, commented that     Were it not for your reworking of Clause 7 of the Bribery Bill 2010,         it would not have         received the Parliamentary support it did.
Section 7 as it became is a         testament to your         scholarship and innovation, drawing upon your well deserved reputation         as the authority on         comparative corporate criminal responsibility.
This section is destined         to become the         "offence of choice" for prosecutions in the area of corporate bribery.
([c])     The Chairman of the OECD Working Group on Bribery in International       Business transactions has       also noted how Wells "clearly influenced" the section of the       Bribery Act 2010 so that it now       complies with the requirements of the OECD's Anti-Bribery Convention       ([f]).
The international reach and significance of the corporate offence in the       UK Bribery Act has       triggered compliance responses from multinational corporations as a result       of its reverse onus       adequate procedures defence and because of its wide extra territorial       effect.
Companies are       advised by Transparency International, among others, that compliance with       the UK Act goes       beyond that required under the US Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act 1977:     The Bribery Act ... presents heightened liability risks for companies,         directors and         individuals.
To avoid corporate liability for bribery, companies must         make sure that they         have strong, up-to-date and effective anti-bribery policies and systems.

Major influence on OECD and International Bar Association     Beyond this specific and direct contribution to impact on domestic       legislation, Wells has       significantly influenced the international agenda in other respects.
She has worked with the OECD to develop its Anti-Corruption Initiative in       the corporate context.
Corporate liability is unfamiliar to many of the 40 Anti Bribery       Convention signatory states and her       expertise formed the basis of discussion at the high-level,       invitation-only event organised by the       OECD across South East Asia in September 2010.
This was attended by a       range of government       anti-corruption representatives and other non-academic policy-makers       ([g]).
The invitation was       issued to Wells in reflection of her contribution to the foundation of the       OECD approach to bribery       and corruption: "We believe that you would be able to give the members         of the `Initiative' an         important basis for beginning their legislative work on legal persons'         liability under the UNCAC"       ([b]).
Finally, her impact extends to developments in international law in       respect of corporate complicity       in human rights violations and to the work of the International Bar       Association's Human Rights       Institute's Task Force on Tax Havens, Poverty and Human Rights.
Wells was       appointed a member       of this international task force in 2012.
Wells' input occurred during the       REF period and specifically       used her research on remedies [1], [4] and [5] to develop the Task Force       recommendations around       corporate responsibilities.
Thus, the research directly influenced the       work of the Taskforce and her       "... input was of crucial importance ..." and "... has         considerably shaped the Taskforce         deliberations as well as the recommendations in the final report".
In 2012, the Task Force met in       London and, Dublin; in June 2012, Wells contributed to the high level       multi-stakeholder       consultation event in Latin America by leading the evidence and feedback       sessions held by the       Task Force ([e]).
The stakeholder meeting included lawyers,       representatives of international       institutions, revenue administration and NGOs from Brazil, Colombia,       Bolivia, Peru and Argentina.
Wells' presentation is an Appendix in the final Report.
