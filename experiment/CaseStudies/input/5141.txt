     As a direct result of the dissemination of LSHTM's Mwanza research,       international momentum to eliminate syphilis gained pace, leading to WHO's       launch of a major new initiative for the global elimination of congenital       syphilis in 2007,5.1 marked by the publication of a special       supplement of the journal Sexually Transmitted Diseases in which       Watson-Jones' research was cited 12 times.
Although these predate the REF       `impact period', they have resulted in ongoing and new impacts ever since.
These include the publication, in 2010, of the Centres for Disease Control       and Prevention (CDC) and WHO `road map' for the global elimination of       congenital syphilis which cites four publications by Watson-Jones with       particular emphasis on the effectiveness of antenatal syphilis screening       and single-dose benzathine penicillin treatment for the prevention of       adverse pregnancy outcomes.5.2 In 2012, based on consultations       involving LSHTM researchers (2007-2011), WHO published its Investment         Case for Eliminating Mother-to-child Transmission of Syphilis,       drawing on LSHTM research to make the economic case for screening.5.3     As a direct result of Mabey's and Peeling's POCT evaluation study, The       Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria announced it would fund the purchase       of syphilis POCT by country programmes beginning in 2007/2008.
Mabey and       Peeling's close collaboration with national policy-makers for this study       directly resulted in the incorporation of POCT for syphilis into the       prenatal screening programmes and official health care strategies of six       countries between 2010 and 2012: China, Brazil, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia       and Peru.
Impacts are detailed in WHO's Research for Universal Health         Coverage 2013 report which notes that over 150,000 individuals were       screened as a result of the LSHTM study and states: `in all participating       countries, the study achieved significant increases in coverage of       diagnostic testing for syphilis.
This reduced the prevalence of syphilis       and the risk of HIV infection'.5.4 The research also helped to       strengthen health services in some of the participating countries.
In       Brazil, for instance, it has provided a model for the provision of health       services to indigenous populations, as well as a template for the       introduction of new technologies.
Impact was made at the highest level of       government: at a Chinese meeting of the State Council in November 2010,       Premier Wen Jiabao announced that the state would fund syphilis screening       in Chinese antenatal clinics5.5 and, in 2012, Brazil's Minister       of Health declared syphilis screening for remote populations would be one       of three main national priorities to combat sexually transmitted disease.5.6     Dr Lori Newman, who leads syphilis research at WHO said: `The public       health impact of this study is clearly documented in the dramatic increase       in syphilis testing coverage of pregnant women in the participating       countries ... the tools and lessons learned from that work have been used       to scale-up syphilis testing coverage in other countries as well.
'5.7       These `other countries' include six African and 19 South American       countries whose policy-makers participated in jointly sponsored LSHTM/WHO       meetings in Dar es Salaam and Lima during 2011.
During these meetings a       `rapid syphilis toolkit' was launched.
Developed at LSHTM, this free       online resource is designed to help national health programme managers       introduce and scale-up the use of POCTs.
In March 2012, Peeling established the Global Congenital Syphilis       Partnership.5.8 Hosted by LSHTM, the Partnership includes       global leaders in health and development such as the Bill &amp; Melinda       Gates Foundation, Save the Children, WHO and CDC.
Since its formation it       has provided technical support for the use and evaluation of a new       generation of `duplex' POCTs for HIV and syphilis now being developed by       two major diagnostics companies (Standard Diagnostics and Chembio).
When       the Partnership was launched, Peeling was interviewed about LSHTM research       by BBC Radio 4's Today programme (over 7m listeners/week), The         Guardian, Metro (2m readership), Reuters news and the British         Medical Journal with additional coverage appearing, among others, in       the Huffington Post, The Chicago Tribune, The Globe and Mail       (Canada) and on Fox News.
Definitive diagnosis of congenital syphilis is difficult, however WHO       estimates suggest that in the four years following the publication of       LSHTM's Mwanza research, the global prevalence of syphilis dropped to less       than half of what it was.5.9 Reports from the Americas note       that since LSHTM's local POCT projects there has been an expansion in       syphilis testing among pregnant women, with 10 out of 29 countries now       reporting 95% of those attending antenatal care having been tested.5.10
