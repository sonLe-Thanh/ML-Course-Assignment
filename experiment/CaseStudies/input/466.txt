     The SANAD Trial identified lamotrigine as first line treatment for       patients with focal epilepsy.
This drug was demonstrated to be clinically       and cost effective to the NHS.
SANAD also identified valproate as the most       effective treatment for patients with generalised epilepsy.
A network       meta-analysis of similar antiepileptic drug trials provides the best       overview of currently available evidence.
Prognostic modelling of these       data allow the identification of patients at differing risk of seizure       remission, allowing stratification for outcomes in patient consultations.
This work had the following impacts:            SANAD triggered an update of the NICE epilepsy guideline which was         published in 2012 [7].
This provides impact on the health and wellbeing         of over 32,000 people per year who are newly diagnosed with epilepsy as         well as over half of the 600,000 prevalent population that are treated         with antiepileptic drug monotherapy.
Data from SANAD and the network meta-analysis underpins the 2012         guidance provided by NICE.
Lamotrigine is recommended as a first line         treatment for focal epilepsy while gabapentin and topiramate are not.
Valproate is recommended as a first line treatment for generalised         epilepsy while topiramate is not.
Identifying topiramate and gabapentin         as poor choices for monotherapy has resulted in significant savings for         the NHS.
SANAD underpins guidance in other countries (e.g.
German epilepsy         guidelines [8], International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE guidelines)         [9].
SANAD allows better understanding of the impacts of taking         antiepileptic drugs, including: that there are few important differences         between drugs in quality of life outcomes; and that cognitive impairment         associated with epilepsy is more likely related to underlying pathology         than the drugs.
This understanding will be important in devising future         intervention programmes.
The MESS trial compared antiepileptic drug treatment versus no treatment       following a first seizure and for early epilepsy and identified a subgroup       of patients likely to benefit from treatment.
Further prognostic modelling       identifies patients at risk of recurrence to inform driving policy.
This work had the following impacts:            MESS data underpin NICE guidance (2012) for patients with first         seizures [7].
The guidance highlights the prognostic modelling to inform         risk stratification and decision making.
This informs the management,         impacting on the health and wellbeing, of over 60,000 people who         experience a first unprovoked seizure per annum in the UK.
Prognostic modelling of data from MESS informed UK and EU driving         policy (2012) [9,10].
Regulations changed for patients with a first         seizure who are allowed to drive once 6 months seizure free rather than         12 months, unless in a high risk group.
Designation of `high risk' was         informed by prognostic modelling of MESS.
The aforementioned cohort studies assessing outcomes associated with in       utero exposure to antiepileptic drugs treatment inform treatment decisions       by providing reliable and valid information about the risks to the unborn       children.
These studies have quantified risk to cognitive development       associated with a number of antiepileptic drugs and identify sodium       valproate as the drug with the greatest risk.
Data allow better informed       decision making and have informed guidelines, and regulators.
This work has had the following impacts:            Altered prescribing practices in the UK and US: There has been a         substantial reduction in the prescribing of valproate to women with         epilepsy of child bearing age and a subsequent increase in alternative         drugs including lamotrigine and levitaricatem [5,6,15].
The recommendations of the Federal Drugs Administration [13] "The           U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is informing the public that           children born to mothers who take the anti-seizure medication           valproate sodium or related products (valproic acid and divalproex           sodium) during pregnancy have an increased risk of lower cognitive           test scores than children exposed to other anti-seizure medications           during pregnancy.
This conclusion is based on the results of           epidemiologic studies that show that children born to mothers who took           valproate sodium or related products throughout their pregnancy tend           to score lower on cognitive tests (IQ and other tests) than children           born to mothers who took other anti-seizure medications during           pregnancy."
Updating of patient information leaflet for the drug Epilim (sodium         valproate), warning of the risks associated following feotal exposures         [15].
The publication of guidelines for preconceptual counselling for WWE         both in the UK and US [12,13,14].
Beneficiaries of this work include            People with new onset first seizures (60,000 per annum) and epilepsy         (32,000 per annum).
The work has identified treatment options with the         best outcomes and has identified benefit harm trade-offs, leading to         better informed treatment choices and a focus on outcomes of importance         and relevance to them.
The NHS and other health systems caring for people with epilepsy,         through providing effective and cost effective care.
Topiramate and         gabapentin were found to be both less effective and more costly and are         rarely used a monotherapy in epilepsy.
