     Impacts On The Management Of Eating And Drinking Difficulties           (Dysphagia)     Research on adherence to dysphagia management strategies, and the       barriers to adherence were of considerably interest to the National       Patient Safety Agency who incorporated the findings into their Guidance       Paper (ref 0500) which was designed to reduce the deaths and disease       burden resulting from eating and drinking difficulties in people with       learning difficulties.
This Guidance Paper identifies best practice for       healthcare organisations, such as a local policy on dysphagia care       including systems for reporting patient safety incidents, provision of       information on dysphagia management and recommendations for staff       training.
The risk assessment materials were devised for this report by       authors of the research papers identified in 3 (above).
This research has informed practice in many Trusts, for example Guthrie's       staff training at a medium secure unit (Calderstones Partnership       Foundation Trust), after which increased risk awareness resulted in       increased reporting of choking incidents but significant reductions in       severity.
This work has been shortlisted for the National Patient Safety       Award 2013, mental health category [A].
Research is extensively cited in Eating well: children and adults with       learning disabilities, Nutritional and practical guidelines provided by       The Caroline Walker Trust [B].
In addition, the research resulted in the establishment of an RCSLT       Special Interest Group on Dysphagia which has disseminated research       findings and resulting best practice guidance through regular meetings and       seminars.
The capacity-building role of this group is evidenced by members       of this group who are now engaging in their own research (e.g.
Manchester       NHS PCT Small Grants Scheme: "Knowing when I'm sick and helping me stay       healthy: Parents' insights into the impact of communication on the       diagnosis, treatment and management of health; Department of Health       Support For Science funded: "Training support staff to modify fluids to       appropriate safe consistencies for adults with intellectual disabilities       and dysphagia: an efficacy study."
UK And International Impacts On Communication Assessment And           Intervention     The approaches to communication assessment and intervention developed in       "Communication before Speech" have informed the widely used Welsh       government initiative for the education of children with profound       disabilities, "Routes for Learning" [C], One of its authors says "the         development group was unanimous in agreeing that it (Communication         Before Speech) was unrivalled in the detail it provided in the very         early stages of communication, and the clarity of the examples it         provided.
We felt that teachers could be referred to Communication         Before Speech and would find practical guidance which was soundly based         on evidence.
It is worth noting that Routes for Learning is not only         widely used in schools in the UK, but has also been translated into a         number of European Languages.
Consequently the influence of         Communication Before Speech has also spread into these other countries."
The book's research is extensively cited in Department for Education's       (2010) Training materials for teachers of learners with severe, profound       and complex learning difficulties [D], module 9 of Scope's       curriculum Supporting Communication through AAC and the QCA guidance       Planning, teaching and assessing the curriculum for pupils with learning       difficulties (2009).
It also provides the underpinning concepts for the       Australian Triple C: Checklist of Communicative Competence, one of very       few communication assessments designed specifically for adults with       profound disabilities, and the only one with well-researched psychometric       properties.
According to its author [E] "Communication before         Speech" provided a framework for the Triple C...The Triple C used the         terminology presented in "Communication Before Speech" for the 6 stages         of communication &#8212; i) reflexive, ii) reactive, iii) proactive, iv)         intentional informal, v) intentional formal and vi) intentional         referential.
Much of the descriptive information to accompany the stages         was adapted from the work done by Coupe-O'Kane and Goldbart."
According to the Learning and Skills Excellence Gateway [F] "Written         by two specialists in the field, Coupe-O'Kane and Goldbart is a key text         on early communication.
Through an extensive review of the literature it         provides a very comprehensive and clear understanding of pre-intentional         and intentional communication.
It also provides methods of teaching         early meanings to children and adults with severe communication delay.
One of the most practical aspects of this book is the two detailed         assessment schedules with extensive notes about their use.
It is an         invaluable resource for anyone working with people with profound and         complex learning difficulties.
The revisions to Milestones 1-3 of the         Pre Entry Curriculum Framework drew extensively on the Early         Communication Assessment (ECA) described in this book."
The research contained in the book has been incorporated into a wide       diversity of training materials, such as RNIB's Effective Practice Guide:       Becoming a Sensitive Communication partner, Scope's Supporting       Communication through AAC Module 9: Children and Adults with Profound and       Multiple Learning Difficulties.
The pervasive impact of this research enabled Goldbart and Caton to       tender successfully to Mencap and Department of Health's Valuing People       team for a project aimed at providing clear information for commissioners       of services, service providers and carers and family members of people       with severe and complex disabilities (proxy consumers of services) on what       communication intervention approaches were evidence-based (using Sackett       et al's triarchic concept of EBP).
This document [6 above] was       published in 2010 by Mencap.
In addition to the review of existing       evidence, interview and focus group data were collected from parents of       children and adults with complex communication needs as well as from       researchers and expert practitioners.
Thus, this report constitutes both       underpinning research and impact.
"The new guide will be a         valuable tool for families and professionals," said Beverley Dawkins       OBE, chair of the PMLD Network and national officer for PMLD at Mencap.
"Communication         is a human right that many of us take for granted.
It allows people to         interact with others, express their feelings and be involved in the         decisions that affect their everyday lives."

According to the chief executive of one agency "As part of [our]         staff induction programme, we do sessions on non-verbal communication.
Reference [6] is central to this training.
Staff are         given a copy of this publication and also referred to [5] as         essential reading.
Additionally, we recommend [6] to professionals from         other voluntary organisations and health and social care staff working         with people with profound and multiple learning disabilities."
