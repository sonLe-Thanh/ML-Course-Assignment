     This case study is an example of an Interim Impact on       Health and Welfare delivered through       Practitioners (Speech and Language Therapists (SLTs) and Specialist       Teachers) who work with       Children with language difficulties.
The research findings were first taken up by I-CAN, the children's       communication charity, in 2011,       and supported their involvement in the Department of Education-funded       study "Engage in       Education" led by Catch22 (April 2011-April 2013) (1).
The study involved       a number of key       stakeholders, including I-CAN, Rathbone, PPP and Dyslexia Action and       embraced five sites       nationally with approximately 30 young people at each site.
The project set out to improve the life chances and outcomes of young       people likely to be excluded       from schools by targeting relevant risk factors, including communication       difficulties.
I-CAN's       Director of Outcomes and Information confirmed (2) that Prof Henry's       research made a significant       and material contribution towards the development of training and       materials for children and young       people with executive functioning difficulties.
Key outcomes from an I-CAN evaluation of the study (2013) included (3):            90% of staff said that they would change the way they would work with         children due to the         experiences/findings, particularly as a result of being able to identify         hidden communication         difficulties amongst young people.
Individuals have commented: 	"It's been amazing.
I can't believe how much the young people have           engaged in the           communication sessions.
They've done activities like debating and           discussing topics that I'd           never have thought they'd even try.
It's changed the way I'll teach my           sessions from now           on" - a key worker in Manchester.
"As a practitioner I-CAN has introduced useful communication           strategies which are now           embedded in my own skillset and I can continue to use them when           creating future group           work plans for young people."

As a result of the study, 55% of young people felt that they were         better communicators with         one individual saying: "Before I'd have just got angry and walked           out of the session but this           time I said my point and got it across.
It felt really good."
The study specifically points out in its main findings that there was         a particular improvement         in remembering words, with 59% stating that this was the outcome "most           strongly related to           materials produced by Prof Henry" on working memory (2).
84% of learners increased their attainment, or stayed at the same         level;       Over 80% of learners reported that they had improved their confidence,         behaviour,         communication skills and attitudes towards teacher, attendance and         school work;       95% of parents reported that their children's attendance at school had         improved either "a lot         or quite a bit";       Fixed term exclusions had decreased by 21% as a result of the         programme.
The report concluded: Most importantly, both staff and young people are       able to recognise the link       between focusing on communication skills, and an increase in engagement       with learning.
"The role of the Communication Advisor (SLT) has been invaluable to my         understanding of         hidden communication needs.
Having a balance of awareness training and         continued workforce         development through the Advisor attending caseload management meetings         and learning walks         with the staff has been very successful.
This has reinforced how the         strategies can be used in         practice and allowed our team to develop unique ways of working to meet         the individual needs         of the young people with the guidance of the Advisor."
Building on the positive outcomes of the study and to extend its reach,       Prof Henry and I-CAN       jointly organised a workshop on 17 May 2013 at LSBU on "Executive         Functioning in Children with         Language Difficulties" (4).
The workshop was attended by SLT       specialists from schools and other       charitable organisations, such as Afasic, an organisation that supports       parents and represents       children and young people with language and communication needs.
95% of       the attendees took       away learning and teaching materials on executive functioning provided by       Prof Henry and       subsequently received a poster (5) for display at their place of work and       highlighting key symptoms       of executive functioning, e.g.
poor memory for instructions and       inattentive behaviour, and how       these may be recognised and addressed.
Independent consultants contacted workshop attendees in June and July       2013 to see what       activities had taken place and what outputs had occurred.
Feedback (6)       indicated that attendees       found the materials and approach to be creditable and based upon sound       science.
They confirmed       that they will impact on the way they address such issues.
One attendee       (7) had the opportunity to       employ the approach before 31st July 2013.
A speech and       language specialist from Symbol UK       trialled the materials on a 16-year old severely disadvantaged student.
Although only a short       duration, improvements were evident to the specialist.
The student herself       felt that there had been       improvement and that she had gained in confidence as a result.
