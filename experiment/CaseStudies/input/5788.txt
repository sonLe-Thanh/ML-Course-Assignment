     The knowledge that yeast culture protected vulnerable animals from oxygen       contamination of their ruminal fermentation led to a rapid increase in       acceptance of yeast culture by the feed industry and farmers [d].
Benefits       to health and productivity of cattle were observed across the globe.
Sales       over sustained periods of time reflect whether farmers observe benefits.
Precise data on sales are protected, however, it is known that yeast is       supplied to the majority of feedlot cattle in North America, and in the UK       perhaps one-third of cattle receive yeast culture (particularly during       winter months when its benefits are most evident).
One company, Alltech       Inc., has grown from a $10M annual turnover in 1990 to in excess of $200M       today, substantially on the back of yeast sales.
Other companies that       feature yeast as their headline product have expanded too; they include       Lallemand, Diamond V, Biosaf and Lesaffre [a].
The last company's       marketing depends entirely on spin-offs from original observations made at       Aberdeen.
The Lallemand product is marketed as the product LEVUCELL&#174; SC as       a specific live yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077       preparation that enhances rumen efficiency.
The product information states       that... "A feeding program using Lallemand products will have a         positive effect on your livestock business".
See       http://www.lallemandanimalnutrition.com/our-products/ruminants/.
The `increased rumen efficiency' arises from the oxygen-protective       effect.'

A recent meta-analysis (Poppy et al., 2012, J.
Dairy Sci.
95, 6027)       indicated that the benefit of yeast was an increased milk production of       1.16 kg/cow/day, or 423 kg/cow/yr.
The farm gate price of milk is &#163;0.31       per kg (http://www.dairyco.org.uk/market-information/supply-production/milk-production/uk-monthly-and-annual-milk-deliveries/), so the benefit       per cow would be &#163; 0.31 &#215; 423 = 131/cow/year.
The dairy herd comprises       1.81M cows (http://www.dairyco.org.uk/market-information/farming-data/cow-numbers/uk-cow-numbers/).
A       conservative estimate would be that one-third of all UK dairy cows receive       yeast, therefore the total UK benefit from feeding yeast to dairy cows       would be &#163;M 131 &#215; 1.81/3 = &#163;79M per annum.
As the beef industry nationwide       has a value of &#163;2.42bn (EBLEX, http://www.eblex.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/p_cp_eblex_balancing_the_market_final_220512.pdf),and       the percentage response in beef animals to yeast is greater than dairy,       the total benefit from yeast must exceed &#163;110M per annum in the UK cattle       industry.
The impact of the research continues as the yeast market continues to       grow.
The Ruminant Product Development Manager of AB Vista, formerly of       Lallemand, provided an analysis indicating that sales of yeast in the feed       industry globally were worth around &#163;196M in 2009, growing to &#163;214M in       2013 [b].
She indicated major opportunities for expansion in Eastern       European and Asian countries.
Part of the impact of the research was consultancy work generated as a       result of the discoveries, benefitting both the companies and the       University.
The livestock industry is one that is acutely aware of       efficacy.
If a product has no benefit, farmers won't use it.
The vast       sales show that it does work and farmers' confidence is enhanced, partly       by the Aberdeen research results, which the feed companies transmit to       them as `how yeast works'.
Confidential research contracts were awarded       through the then commercial arm of RINH, Rowett Research Services,       throughout the 1990s and 2000s with the major companies involved in yeast,       including Alltech, Lallemand, DCL Yeast Ltd, Biosaf, Lesaffre and Sanofi.
Therefore, research that catalysed the impact that has been manifest       within the REF window has its origins in the 1990's and continues to this       date.
The discovery of the mode of action of yeast in the rumen led       directly to two contributions to legislation and contributed to a deep       involvement in another.
Wallace was called to Brussels in 1999 to advise       the European Commission's Scientific Commission on Animal Nutrition (SCAN)       in drawing up their registration requirements to control feed additives:       in particular, SCAN needed to understand our findings that metabolically       active, but not necessarily live or growing yeast, can effect the benefits       to ruminal fermentation.
The second direct involvement was that Wallace       wrote the mode of action section of the dossier submitted by Alltech to       SCAN in the late 1990s.
The influence of Wallace's work on yeast, among       other feed additives, resulted in his appointment in 2012 to FEEDAP, the       successor to SCAN in the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), possibly       the greatest impact stemming from the original research.
This research       continues to have policy relevance because, under Article 10.2 of       Regulation 1813/2003, all feed additives already approved and on the       market must be re-authorised.
Evidence of the mechanism of action of yeast       as an animal food growth enhancer and the experience gained from the       research therefore have high relevance to current EFSA policy decisions.
Claimed impact as defined by REF guidance:     Thus the impact generated as defined by REF includes: impact on public         policy, legislation and and services.
The team was also engaged by         leading companies to advise on dossiers to be submitted for regulatory         approval, thus having an impact on commerce in the area of gain in         productivity and reduction in costs of food.
Demonstrable collaborations         with industry have occurred and commercial adaptation of a new process         concept and in husbandry methods has occurred.
The research affected         animal health and production yields of livestock.
Gains in productivity         have been realised as a result of research-led changes in practice.
