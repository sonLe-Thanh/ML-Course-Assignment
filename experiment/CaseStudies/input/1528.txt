     Research funded by ESF/EQUAL [corroborating source A] highlighted the       need for employability interventions to move away from skills based       initiatives to incorporate strategies designed to support the personal,       social and attitudinal barriers faced by the long-term unemployed,       including refugees.
The research led to changes, both before and since       2008, to the provision of employability training initiatives in the city       to incorporate such strategies.
Research with refugee women helped to fill       the gap between the employability skills needs of refugee women and       existing training and development opportunities and led to changes to       policy, practice and provision to support refugee women being implemented       across the region both before and since 2008.
The researchers were invited       to sit on the steering committee of the Refugee Women: Access to       Employment (RWAE) project managed by the Yorkshire and Humberside       Consortium for Asylum Seekers and Refugees which helped to further inform       strategies to best meet the needs of refugee women.
Willott also       represented Higher Education Institutions on the Regional Integration       Network (other partners included Local government; UKBA; Voluntary sector       agencies; Housing providers; Employers' organisations; Job Centre Plus).
As part of their research [B] Stevenson and Willott worked directly with       young unaccompanied asylum seekers to write and produce a Guide to Higher       Education for Refugees and Asylum Seekers &amp;mfash; 1000 copies of which       were distributed to refugees, asylum seekers and supporting organisations       across the Yorkshire and Humberside region.
They produced an `Admissions       Staff' toolkit which was made available to all HEIs in England and which       laid out clear guidance on the rights and entitlements of refugees and       asylums seekers to access higher education.
Willott also contributed to       the Refugee Council Information Service guidebook on accessing HE.
This       work helped to inform subsequent briefing papers developed by the Refugee       Council on generic rights and entitlements, whilst Stevenson and Willott's       research for the Teacher Development Agency/Refugee Council `Refugees into       Teaching' project informed subsequent briefing papers disseminated across       the UK to schools and teacher recruitment agencies detailing the rights of       refugees to undertake teaching work.
The impact of this work is evidenced by James Lee, former Policy Adviser       for the Refugee Council.
Lee [C] writes that:     "My time of working with Jacqueline and John while on secondment to         Leeds Metropolitan University from the Refugee Council continues to         inform my policy work.
More immediately, it led to be applying for and         being appointed as the national lead for refugee employment and skills         policy at the Refugee Council in London.
I held this post until 2011.
The discussions with J&amp;J, and their subsequent research on refugee         employment and higher education, were formative in developing my policy         focus.
Higher education formed a key part of this work and led to better         recognition of overseas qualification for refugee overseas trained         teachers, clarification of national guidance on eligibility for student         support and raising the profile of distinct barriers to HE for refugees         with previous Level 4 or above study outside of the UK.
The latter         included articles in the national and specialist press (e.g.
Runneymede         Trust's Spring Bulletin, 2011)".
A further, direct consequence of this body of work with refugees was       Willott's successful bid to the AHRC/ESRC Religion &amp; Society Programme       PhD Studentship (Bereket Loul: "Deriving meaning in transition: the role       of religion for young refugees and asylum seekers").
Willott's work with       female refugees was instrumental in his successful funding bid to UN Women       to undertake research with Acid Survivor's Trust International, designed       to change policy and laws, and facilitate improved medical and       psychosocial support for survivors of attacks in Uganda, Cambodia &amp;       Nepal (2011).
Following Willott's ESF-funded research designed to inform national       institutional policy to enhance the degree and employability outcomes of       black and minority ethnic students [D], Stevenson and Clegg's work on       inequalities in post-graduate outcomes has also led to policy and practice       recommendations being adopted across the sector.
Stevenson's Institutional         Case Study research for Black and Minority Ethnic Student Degree         Attainment project (2012) culminated in a set of `guiding       principles' underpinning further recommendations designed to specifically       address the key question: "how can the curriculum enhance the retention       and success of BME students in higher education?".
These guiding       principles have subsequently informed the HEAs approach to funding eight       Strategic Development Grants.
These projects, running between 2012 and       2013, directly aim to improve BME student retention and attainment [E].
Stevenson is a member of the Strategic Development Grants advisory group       and her work on this project has led directly to her being commissioned to       deliver a Learning and Teaching Summit in Northern Ireland funded by the       Higher Education Academy (May 2013) to provide leadership in the area of       student retention and success of local students in higher education in       Northern Ireland, and to participate in HEFCE/OFFA's joint roundtable       discussion (2103) to discuss equality and diversity and widening       participation.
Stevenson's research into degree attainment at Russell       Group universities [F] was the subject of critical debate on Radio London       and in the Voice newspaper (http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/black-students-reluctant-approach-lecturers-help),       the Turkish newspaper Zaman (http://www.weeklyzaman.com/en/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=8098)       and the Times Higher (24th January, 7th and 14th       February 2013) [G]; Stevenson has also been invited to undertake a public       lecture for the University of Oxford public seminar series: Resilience         and retention in higher education: why do some students stay?.
This       seminar resulted from wider research projects with Clegg exploring the       resilience of students, including those from BME backgrounds, who remain       in HE and how students think about their post-graduate futures.
User       guides drawing on the research findings have been made freely available       on-line and have been accessed locally, nationally and internationally       [H].
The combined impact of this work is encapsulated in the ARC Network       (2013) Report to HEFCE and OFFA: Literature review of research into       widening participation to higher education, commissioned to inform the       national strategy for access and student success which the Higher       Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and the Office for Fair       Access (OFFA) are developing, wherein seven of Stevenson's works are cited       [I].
