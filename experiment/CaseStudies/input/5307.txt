            Grimes' work on nuclear fuel performance and waste behaviour, in         particular on radiation damage of nuclear materials (references 1 and 2)         has led to him becoming arguably the UKs leading nuclear scientist         (sources A,B).
He was part, as the nuclear expert, of a UK         industry/academia delegation to India in 2010 led by the Prime Minister         David Cameron.
During the Fukushima incident in 2011 he was called upon         to be a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE),         providing the science advice to the Cabinet Office Briefing Room A         (COBRA), on issues such as the state of the reactors and the safety of         UK nationals.
Subsequently, he was appointed a member of the Office of         Nuclear Regulation's Technical Advisory Panel reporting to the Secretary         of State (2011) on the implications for the UK nuclear industry of the         Fukushima nuclear accident.
Grimes' fundamental understanding of nuclear issues (e.g.
references         1-3) and his civil nuclear leadership (sources B and C) also resulted in         Rolls-Royce placing a University Technology Centre (UTC) in Nuclear         Engineering at Imperial, of which he is founding Director.
Rolls-Royce         regards this UTC as playing a central role in the development of its new         civil nuclear business.
He was the Specialist Advisor to the House of         Lords Science and Technology Committee (HoLSTC) for its 2011 enquiry and         report on Nuclear R&amp;D Capabilities which highlighted the urgent need         for fundamental change in the way that nuclear research is conducted in         the UK.
This led to his appointment in March 2012 to the UK Government         Nuclear Research and Development Advisory Board chaired by the         Government Chief Scientific Advisor, which reported to Government early         2013 advising on the development of a long-term nuclear energy strategy.
Lee was appointed Specialist Advisor to the HoLSTC for their 2013         follow-up to the 2011 report on Nuclear R&amp;D Capabilities.
Grimes was a member of the Royal Society Working Group on Nuclear         Non-Proliferation, which generated the report Fuel Cycle Stewardship in         a Nuclear Renaissance (source A) and subsequently co-chaired the         discussion meeting Nuclear Energy in the 21st Century.
In his         supporting letter (source B) the Chairman of the UKAEA emphasises Grimes         "vital role for the progress of nuclear physics, nuclear engineering and         nuclear materials activities in the UK as expert technical advisor to         the HoLSTC you were instrumental in guiding their Lordships to a hard         hitting report on the status of Nuclear R&amp;D in the UK and the need         for a clearly defined and substantial R&amp;D programme to underpin the         new Nuclear Build.....".
Grimes's and Lee's influence was clearly         demonstrated in the recent report of the Ad Hoc Nuclear R&amp;D         Advisory Board chaired by the Government chief scientific adviser (CSA)         with Grimes as member (source C) which made several recommendations to         Government including the setting up of a National Nuclear R&amp;D         Advisory Board, a National Nuclear Users Facility and a strong programme         of R&amp;D in support of geological disposal all of which the Government         has begun to put in place (source D).
Grimes has been working with the         Foreign and Commonwealth Office Science and Innovation Team promoting UK         nuclear research capabilities, particularly in India (leading to an         EPSRC-India portfolio of joint projects) and SE Asia, and was appointed         Chief Scientific Advisor to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in Feb.         2013.
Lee's unique understanding of the processing and durability of         vitreous and ceramic waste forms (references 4-6) gave him the expertise         to be appointed CoRWM Deputy Chair in Oct 2007.
CoRWM has since had a         major influence on the Government's &#163;multi-billion MRWS programme via         its scrutiny and advice role to DECC (specifically the Energy Minister         and Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change) and the Nuclear         Decommissioning Authority (NDA).
Lee lead the CoRWM R&amp;D Group form         2007-13 and met regularly with the research leaders of the NDA, RWMD,         NNL, Sellafield Sites, EdF Energy, RCUK (EPSRC/NERC) offering formal and         informal scrutiny and advice.
This culminated in the CoRWM R&amp;D         Report (2009) whose 6 key recommendations (source E) were reported to         the HoLSTC (source F) and where possible at this stage in the MRWS         programme, have mostly been accepted and acted upon by Government.
Specifically, his work on the concept of glass composite materials         (reference 4) had led to the UK now developing such waste forms through         development work at Sellafield Sites plc using thermal methods such as         plasma melting to host some of the ill-defined wastes in the Sellafield         Legacy Ponds and Silos.
These represent the biggest threat to UK         security and cost &#163;70M/annum just to keep in their current state.
As an example, the first CoRWM recommendation (source E) on improved         coordination of the UKs radwaste R&amp;D programme led directly to         changes to the NDAs Research Board while another recommendation         influenced the process by which outside users can access the NNLs active         facilities.
As CoRWM Deputy Chair Lee had regular meetings with the CEO         of the NDA, the DECC Chief Scientific Advisor, the Energy Minister, the         Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change as well as leading         civil servants in the DECC nuclear team.
These meetings influenced         Government waste management policy specifically in the repository         volunteerism process, additional support from RCUK for waste R&amp;D and         greater participation in international programmes.
In his supporting letter (source G) the CoRWM Chair highlights         reference 4 as one of the reasons for Lee's appointment to CoRWM and         lists areas where CoRWM's R&amp;D Report had influence including in "the         establishment of an Advisory Board on Nuclear R&amp;D, chaired by the         Government Chief Scientific Advisor, with a remit that includes R&amp;D         related to management of legacy and new build radioactive wastes".
CoRWM also does a significant amount of public engagement and this has         led to several radio appearances and work with public and other         stakeholders in the UK (source H) and abroad (e.g.
Bure, France).
Grimes' high media profile (source H) and TV/radio appearances during         the Fukushima accident were responsible for the UK public remaining         positive about the nuclear option (source B).
