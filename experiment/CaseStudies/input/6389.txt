     The impact, beneficiaries and pathways arising out of Dr Churchill's       research are described below:       The beneficiaries to date are:            a range of health professionals (e.g.
consultants, specialist nurses,         dietitians, podiatrists)       Diabetes expert patients and diabetes patients and carers.
The specific impacts, achieved through direct engagement with the design,       development and       evaluation of an autonomy supportive internet-delivered educational       programme about diabetes       and diabetes self-management behaviour, are:            For the health professionals, changed understanding and awareness of         the value of         message framing in supporting autonomous self-care behaviours of people         with diabetes         concomitant with stated intentions to change practice, training and         guidance around         ongoing work with such patients,       for those with diabetes, changed attitudes towards self-management of         diabetes behaviour.
Once implemented the research will also achieve further significant       impacts for people with       diabetes.
Project activities       Dr Churchill engaged in various activities to realise impact from her       research insights.
Phase 1: Project initiation       Dr Churchill met with diabetes specialists (e.g., consultant, podiatrists,       dietitian, specialist nurses)       from two NHS trusts (Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust and Sussex       Community NHS Trust) in       focus groups to discuss key research insights regarding the role of       autonomy in reducing defensive       processing of personally relevant health-risk information.
Phase 2: defining structure and design       Dr Churchill and health professionals agreed that the educational       materials would be set out in five       sections and presented in an autonomy-supportive fashion.
`What is diabetes': background information about diabetes (e.g.
symptoms, causes, risk         factors)       `Monitoring and treatment': information on the management of diabetes         (e.g., monitoring         blood sugar levels, insulin therapy, medications)       `Foot complications': information about diabetes-related foot         complications and how you         might look after your feet       `Looking after you': self-care behaviours that can help people with         diabetes reduce the risk         of adverse health consequences associated with their illness (e.g.,         diet, exercise)       `Living with diabetes': information about living with diabetes on a         day-to-day basis          Phase 3: development phase       Diabetes specialists were involved in all stages of the design and       development of the behavioural       intervention: providing educational materials, reviewing materials,       providing links to external       sources (http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetes/pages/diabetes.aspx,       http://www.diabetes.org.uk/).
Discussions in focus groups and meetings indicated that diabetes       specialists were changing one-to-one       patient education practices based on dissemination of key insights       regarding the role of       autonomy in reducing defensive processing of personally relevant       health-risk information, i.e.,       presenting their advice in an autonomy supportive manner.
Phase 4: evaluation of the internet-delivered intervention       The educational materials were reviewed by diabetes specialists,       non-specialist clinicians and       expert patients.
The next substantive phase (occurring after 31/7/13) is the       implementation of the tool as per the       stated intentions of the health teams, this is pending the completion of a       memorandum of       agreement between the University and the relevant trusts.
This memorandum       has been developed       collaboratively and will be in place before the end of 2013.
Stakeholders engaged in the project       The project involved 22 separate meetings with health professionals across       20 days in the period       March 2012 to June 2013.
Those health professionals directly involved in       various of these       meetings include one consultant and one Speciality Coordinator for       Endocrine &amp; Diabetes, one       Diabetes Specialist, three Specialist Nurses, one Nurse Consultant, one       Dietitian, three Podiatrists.
In addition, Dr Churchill engaged Diabetes expert patients throughout the       project.
Dr Churchill met       twice at an early stage with a group of 4 expert patients to discuss the       function, educational       content and structure of the tool, attended a DESMOND clinic where the       tool was evaluated by 8       expert patients who provided feedback on usability, design, and       educational materials, with two       further expert patients providing online feedback.
Either Dr Churchill or       members of the University       team attended a total of 3 diabetes clinics and interviewed a total of       patients (18) and their carers       (15) to get feedback on educational materials and usability etc..
Meetings held independently by the health professionals directly engaged       in the project occurred       on in April and May 2013 in order to review materials and discuss their       dissemination.
Meetings       known to have occurred include, for example, at least 2 meetings of the       podiatry team (c.6       podiatrists), 3 meetings of the specialist nurse team (c.5 specialist       nurses; one meeting included       the Head of GP services in West Sussex), and at least three meetings of       the small team (2 or 3) of       Dietitians.
Furthermore, anecdotal evidence indicates that the tool has       been discussed informally       across the diabetes teams, and that they worked together between clinics       to identify and collate       materials and that discussion took place across disciplines.
A follow up survey to ascertain the impacts of the work was undertaken       and informs the       subsequent statements.
Significance of the Impacts       The significance of the impacts in terms of how much difference it has       made to beneficiaries is       listed as follows:            The dissemination of Dr Churchill's key research insights regarding         the role of autonomy in         message acceptance and persuasion has informed diabetes specialists'         strategic         information provision, motivational enhancement, and skills training;       Diabetes specialists reported that team meetings were convened to         discuss how they might         present the benefits of diabetes self-management behaviour in an         autonomy supportive         fashion in their verbal communications with patients;       The health professionals reported that they intend to use the         intervention to refresh their         knowledge of diabetes and diabetes self-care behaviour; also,       The health professionals said that they would recommend the         behavioural intervention to         people with diabetes, carers of people with diabetes, and other health         professionals (e.g.,         district nurses, care assistants, GPs).
People with diabetes (and carers of people with diabetes) reviewing       materials indicated that the       presented materials improved their:            knowledge about diabetes (e.g., types of diabetes [e.g., type 1,         type2, MODY, Gestational         diabetes], diagnosis, causes, risk factors);       knowledge about the management of diabetes (e.g., monitoring blood         glucose levels);       knowledge about the foot complications associated with diabetes (e.g.,         neuropathy, foot         ulcers, amputation);       knowledge about self-management behaviours (e.g., foot-care, diet,         physical activity);       knowledge about the skills required for effective self-management         behaviours;       knowledge about living with diabetes (e.g., dietary choices during         Ramadan).
People with diabetes indicated that the diabetes materials encouraged       them to think about their       current self-care behaviour and changed their attitudes towards engagement       with diabetes self-management       behaviour.
People with diabetes said that the materials were presented in       a way that       was `non-threatening' and that encouraged them to `look after themselves',       increasing frequency of       self-care behaviour     Hence, attitudes regarding the effectiveness of self-management behaviour       in reducing risk of       diabetes complications have been changed, encouraging self-management       behaviour and       potentially reducing costs to the NHS.
