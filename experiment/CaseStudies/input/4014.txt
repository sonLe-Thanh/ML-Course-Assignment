Health sector: local production of pharmaceuticals and access to         medicines in Africa     Research by Mackintosh and collaborators has had international       reach and significant impact in       challenging a widely held view that local pharmaceutical production in       Africa is necessarily costly       and inefficient.
It contributed evidence supporting a broad policy shift       at African government and       international levels towards better integration of health and industrial       policy.
Mackintosh presented       evidence showing that imported medicines, but not local manufactures,       display `urban bias' in       accessibility to industrialists, regulators and policymakers at a plenary       of the International       Conference on Local Pharmaceutical Production in Africa (Cape Town April       2011); to UNIDO,       Vienna and UNITAID, Geneva (2010) and at plenaries at international       conferences in Bonn       (February 2013) and the inaugural Euro-Africa Health Investment       Conference, where the       international audience included private industry (12).
The       Pharmaceutical Coordinator for NEPAD       also said the research will `change the global pharmaceutical policy         landscape.'
(18) Research       findings have been fed into: Tanzanian policy debate, where they have `made         a significant         difference...[and] added quite some value' (12); the Gates       Foundation deliberations on private       sector policy; and SCMS (Supply Chain Management System) investigations of       local procurement       in Tanzania.
A senior programme officer in the Gates Foundation states       that Mackintosh is one of       only six academics who have shaped perspectives, policy and practice in       this field, including that of       NGOs working in medicines regulation supported by the Global Fund and       USAID (13).
The       research has been used by the German medical aid organisation, Action       Medeor (AM).
According       to a Director of AM, Mackintosh's `pioneering work [...] provided         scientific evidence in a debate         which was dominated by sentiment.'
Her research `contributed to         the decision made by Action         Medeor to open a second warehouse in Masasi, in the very South of         Tanzania'.
(15) The research       has been referenced in the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plan for         Africa Business Plan produced       by UNIDO and the African Union Commission.
The East African Community and firms in Zimbabwe have taken up Banda's       work on finance       capability and the financing of local pharmaceutical production,       emphasising its link with       technological capability and innovation.
Policy impact in the East African       Community and sub-       Saharan Africa was enhanced by Banda's participation in the Euro-Africa       Health Investment       Conference (April 2013).
This work directly led to commercial impact when,       after discussions of       Banda's research, a Zimbabwean pharmaceutical firm, Varichem, accessed a       $10mUS long-term       loan from an African development bank for a major reinvestment programme       in new production       equipment and machinery (14).
Health sector: Product development partnerships (PDPs) and health         innovation systems     Research by Chataway, Hanlin and colleagues on public-private       PDPs and health innovation       systems has had broad international influence, with impacts on policy       development and strategies       of the International Aids Vaccine Initiative (IAVI).
The IAVI is a PDP       that collaborates with more       than 50 academic, industry and government organisations around the world       to research and       develop AIDS vaccines, and to advocate for the HIV-prevention field.
The       Regional Director of IAVI       confirms that Chataway and Hanlin's evaluation of IAVI had a major impact       on strategy (17),       particularly with regard to capacity building activities.
Objective       research and the codification of       IAVI capacity building efforts carried out by Chataway and Hanlin also       contributed to IAVI's       fundraising efforts.
The evaluation informed the governance of the PDP and       validated the model.
Subsequently, Chataway has advised on the strategies of PDPs in the       current difficult funding       climate, and Hanlin and Chataway have been invited to help develop a new       evaluation of IAVI's       capacity building in Africa.
Expertise in assessing health partnerships       led to: work for the Swiss       Tropical Institute to assist in evaluating the Global Alliance for       Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI)       Alliance's Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) on pneumococcal vaccines at       baseline, and more       recently a request to be involved in the latest evaluation activity of the       AMC mechanism; and work       for the GAVI Alliance on the provision of incentives for the investment in       products targeting       neglected diseases.

Agriculture sector impact     Work undertaken by Clark has been utilised by European, African       and international organisations.
He has had an impact on the policy decisions and funding strategies       governing the UK Department       for International Development (DFID) and, in particular, has played a       significant role in the       development of the Research into Use (RIU) strategy for awarding       funding to technology       development consortia across Africa through his role as Economic Adviser       to the Director of this       programme (16).
For example, he helped devise and facilitate a       `Dragons Den'-style competition       in Nairobi, which brought together an African panel of venture capitalists       and entrepreneurs to       select these consortia.
Approximately 50 people took part in the training       workshop and the       programme organisers received positive feedback on the value of the       exercise.
According to the       RIU Director, the `Dragons Den' exercise ensured that projects were       funded, which would not       previously have received funding, as they were more applied and commercial       in focus and the       funding decisions were more targeted at achieving outcomes in terms of       technology and product       development (16).
Funded `Best Bets' projects include: Armyworm       control (Kenya and Tanzania);       Striga control/seed priming (Kenya); and BCAs (bio control agents) in       Ghana.
Other successful       projects include Farm Input Promotions Ltd (FIPS), an NGO that focuses on       input supply to       smallholders.
Well-Told Story Ltd runs a communications initiative       designed to transfer       technologies to unemployed youth, and The Sleeping Sickness Control (SOS)       project is aimed at       stopping the spread of cattle-driven Trypanosomiasis through a project run       jointly with the private       sector and the University of Makerere.
A project designed to use       multi-media opportunities for       unemployed youth won the international One World Award in May 2011 and the       2012 Digital       Emmy award for best programme in Children and Young People category.
