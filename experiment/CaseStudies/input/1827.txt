     The phase 1 research established Roseneil's reputation as the leading       sociological expert on the       women's peace movement of the late Cold War era, and more widely on       feminist, lesbian and anti-nuclear       politics.
The research involved numerous public knowledge transfer       activities prior to 2008,       many of which have bequeathed lasting cultural products that continue to       be accessed by       journalists and interested publics.
Most notably Roseneil acted as       academic advisor and was       interviewed for the first online Guardian Film, Your Greenham,       directed by Beeban Kidron (2007).
Since 2008, published research and her "in person" advice and consultancy,       which draw on all       three phases of research, have been used by documentary film-makers,       curators, artists, and       writers in the production of a range of cultural artefacts, and have       served to inspire the creative       process.
In addition she has contributed directly to public understanding       of social movements       through numerous media interviews and public speaking engagements that       have reached a wide       variety of audiences including activists, the general public and       specialists beyond the academy.
Impacts on cultural and creative production     Roseneil's research has impacted upon processes of cultural and creative       production that have       resulted in television documentaries, major international and UK       exhibitions, art works by a leading       artist, a film-script, a novel, and significant new archaeological       investigations of heritage.
Greenham Common Changed My Life: a BBC Timeshift documentary         (2010), for which         Roseneil was the academic consultant and a key interviewee, and which         has been aired a         number of times on BBC4 and BBC2.
The Secret Life of the National Grid (2011): Roseneil acted as         an adviser to director/ producer         Jennifer Forde on the feminist anti-nuclear politics of the late 1970s         and 80s for this BBC4         documentary.
Signs of Change: Social Movements Cultures 1960s to Now         (2008-2010): a major art exhibition         curated by Dara Greenwald and Josh MacPhee, in association with Exit         Art, New York City and         funded by the Andy Warhol Foundation.
Roseneil was consulted by the         curators about the         material cultures of UK social movements and loaned materials from her         personal Greenham         research archive for the exhibition.
She was invited to speak about         Greenham and the         preservation of the material cultures of social movements (phase 2         research) at a symposium         at Exit Art in September 2008.
The exhibition toured the US for two         years: Exit Art, New York         (20 September 2008-6 December 2008); Miller Gallery, Carnegie Mellon         University, Pittsburgh         (23 January 2009-8 March 2009); The Arts Center of the Capital Region,         Rensselaer, Troy,         New York (5 April-5 June 2009); The Philip Feldman Gallery, Pacific         Northwest College of Art,         Portland (4 February-19 March 2010) (source 6).
Totipotent Architecture &#8212; Greenham Art Works (2008): art         works by Lucy Orta were produced         as part of the Common Ground Research Group, in dialogue with Roseneil         about the physical         spaces and cultural meanings of Greenham, in person and through her         writings about         Greenham.
The importance of Roseneil's research (phase 1 and 2) to         Orta's art work is         demonstrated in Lucy+Jorge Orta's invitation to Roseneil to contribute a         chapter to a book         about this project: Potential Architecture (2013) (source 7).
The Presentation of Heritage Research Awards (2010): The           Common Ground Research           Group's "queer archaeology" of the material culture and legacy of         Greenham ("Benders and         Bunkers: presenting dissonant heritage") was shortlisted for the Royal           Archaeological Institute/English           Heritage Presentation of Heritage Research Award 2010.
Roseneil         and archaeologist         Marshall presented the project's findings about the significance and         gender politics of         Greenham as a Cold War "heritage site" at a conference at the British         Museum (26 February         2010 before an audience of 250 members of the public, heritage experts,         curators,         conservators and archaeologists.
Archaeologist and journalist Chris         Catling said in an email:         `As a judge at the Presentation of Heritage Research Awards last           Friday I was really rooting for           the Greenham Common presentation, which was the only one from which I           learned anything           new or that challenged my preconceptions' (source 8 on the         Common Ground Project).
Singing the Changes: Oral History and Exhibition (2013): the         Pink Singers LGBT Choir invited         Roseneil to act as consultant in the production of their 30th         anniversary oral history project and         exhibition (funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund).
Drawing on both her         phase 1 and phase 3         research about the social movements and sexuality since the late 1960s,         she gave a talk and         engaged in discussion with choir members at a "scholars workshop" on         LGBT history and the         social changes of the past 30 years, organised by the Project Committee         (17 March 2013).
Her         input at the workshop fed into the conceptualisation and production of         the exhibition, and she         later commented on drafts of the exhibition texts.
Project Committee         member Susan Rudy         wrote `to thank you for the very significant contribution your           research and knowledge made to           the Exhibition itself, and to our members' knowledge of, and pride in,           lesbian and gay history.
[...] We were especially grateful that your presentation identified           key differences between           lesbian and gay history.
Your comments on the significance of the           events at Greenham           Common for lesbian feminists in the early 1980s led us to add several           events to the timeline           and to the exhibition structure itself.
Just as importantly, your           contribution was significant for           the choir members themselves.
Following your presentation, I heard           several young women           chatting excitedly about how they had no idea what the lives of           lesbians in the 1980s had been           like and that they could now see their experience in the context of           broader trends [...] All of us           who spoke with or listened to you and all of those who turn up at the           Exhibition will have been           influenced by your work'.
The Exhibition ran for 10 weeks in 2013         at Audit House and in the         exhibition space at Kings Place in London (sources 1 &amp; 9).

Protest Camp Workshop, Leicester, 26 June 2012: Roseneil         spoke about the politics of spatial         occupation at Greenham (phase 1 and 2 research), and the politics of         memorialization (phase         2 research), in the light of her subsequent theoretical work on the         impacts of social movements         (phase 3 research), and reflecting on the Occupy movement.
She         was the keynote speaker at         this large gathering of activists and activist-researchers.
