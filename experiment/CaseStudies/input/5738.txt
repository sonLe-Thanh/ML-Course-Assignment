     The University's research into novel, highly structured materials in the       form of hollow fibre and       monolithic adsorbents has led to products and processes aimed at energy       efficient gas separation       and purification, meeting legislative emission limits, creating healthier       workplaces, and recovering       valuable resources for reuse.
Consequently, our research has led to       important business and       economic impact in two small-to-medium size enterprises, namely,       Nano-Porous Solutions Ltd (n-psl)       and MAST Carbon International Ltd, as well on the businesses of their       clients.
Nano-Porous Solutions Ltd (n-psl): Following the prestigious Royal       Society Brian Mercer Award       for Innovation to Dr Perera in 2007, n-psl was first registered in the       same year as a University of       Bath spin-out, new business in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear.
n-psl moved into       its first industrial       premises in January 2008, where its business began by recruiting       technical, production and sales       staff.
Meaningful inward investment, growth and employment in n-psl also       started to take place in       2008.
The Finance Director of n-psl has commented that [A]:     `inward investments to exploit Bath's nano-porous materials technology         have now included         over &#163;2 million from industry and venture capitalists as well as &#163;500k         from the Royal Society         Investment Fund.'
Furthermore, Bath's research has created in n-psl a company that [A]:     `now has 24 employees and an annual turnover in excess of &#163;1 million         which is continuing to         grow.'
Using Bath's original research, n-psl has developed product lines that       include ultra-high purity       compressed air dryers, CO2 adsorption dryers, and equipment for       the removal of volatile organic       compounds (VOCs) that are emitted from a broad range of sources [A].
Patent rights have been       assigned by the University to n-psl [B].
Using materials developed at       Bath, n-psl's product range       has continued to grow.
Proving trials include a demonstrator with       Slovakian compressor       manufacturer Ekom for dental air drying and ventilator applications, and       demonstrators for water       and hydrocarbon removal in railway applications in the USA.
Dental dryers       have already been       supplied to the American market [A].
The fibre technology assigned by the University to n-psl has also been       adopted by other       companies, notably Parker Hannifin Manufacturing Ltd, also based in       Gateshead, and Ultra       Electronics in Gloucester.
Parker has collaborated with Bath since 2004       and has used Bath's       technology to create a novel multilayer hollow fibre adsorbent device for       chemical, biological,       radiological and nuclear (CBRN) filtration.
The company won $980k from the       USA Defence Threat       Reduction Agency for this development [C].
The Research Manager at Parker       comments that [C]:     `Following on from its own independent work, dhFNS [domnick hunter       Filtration and Separation       Division of Parker Hannifin Manufacturing Ltd] have also collaborated         extensively with the         University of Bath and their spin-out venture n-psl, further         investigating hollow fibre technology         for not only CBRN applications but also for potential CO2         capture systems and devices for         compressed air dehumidification.
Over a period of 3 years Parker has         invested over $400k in         the research program.'
Parker adds further [C]:     `working with the University of Bath...also assisted in securing the         positions of three R&amp;D         personnel at our Gateshead facility and will hopefully allow us to         recruit more in the future ...     ... recent collaboration has seen the Chemical Engineering Department         contracted to produce a         performance model of our CBRN device.
The successful modelling effort         has proven vital in the         development of our life saving collective protection equipment.'
The superior performance of novel materials developed at Bath for CBRN       applications has made       an impact on other organisations and Dstl (Porton Down), for example, is       now seeking to find out       how the new materials could be used in its respirators [D].
Ultra Electronics (Precision Air &amp; Land Systems) has worked with       n-psl to develop a small       regenerative air drying filter for pneumatic ejection systems in military       aircraft and for drying       oxygen in military fuel cells.
The New Products Manager at Ultra comments       that [E]:     `... the regenerative filter technology [using adsorbent fibres       invented through the original       research] was a key factor in winning a major contract [with       Raytheon Company], which over         the life of the equipment would be worth tens of millions of pounds.'
MAST Carbon International Ltd: MAST, an SME based in Basingstoke,       has collaborated with       Bath researchers from about 1996.
The company's business is in the supply       of advanced carbon       materials for separations, reactions and environmental protection.
One of       MAST's products is the       low pressure drop activated carbon monolith (ACM).
Bath's research on       ACMs, which was carried       out in collaboration with MAST from 1997, stemmed from the University's       original research on       inorganic adsorption monoliths in 1996 and led to the development of a new       process to recover       (VOCs) in the factory workplace.
The European patent naming Crittenden and       MAST staff as       inventors of this new process was granted in 2008 [F].
Alongside invention and development of the new process, Bath's research       also led to       improvements to the design of the company's ACMs which are used within the       process.
The       Managing Director of MAST has commented that [G]:     `...your research team's research skills and knowledge led to a         significant improvement to our         existing ACM design.
To be precise, the cell density of our ACMs was         increased from 250 to         600 cells per square inch based on your research that showed that this         change would improve         the efficiency, effectiveness and dynamics of the solvent [VOC]         recovery process.
It was this         improved design that was used for the industrial scale equipment tested         by ConvaTec.'
Development of the industrial scale equipment (50 m3 h-1       of air) shipped for testing at ConvaTec's       premises in South Wales in 2010 was funded by the TSB.
ConvaTec mounted       equipment trials to       demonstrate that it could be used to meet Environment Agency legislative       limits on the emissions       of ethanol used by the company to dry polymers used in the manufacture of       wound dressings.
The       equipment, constructed by Wellman Defence (Portsmouth) and incorporating       14 ACMs supplied by       MAST to Bath's improved design, costs around &#163;105k (&#163;30k for parts and       &#163;70k for design and       construction man-hours).
MAST comments further [G]:     `...your team's research leading to our better understanding of how         our monoliths work led         recently (2012) to my company's success in winning a &#163;1.5 million Energy         Technology Institute         Award with Inventys to build a 50 kW demonstrator that uses 600 of the         improved ACMs to         recover carbon dioxide from power station flue gases...
...Your         team's research has also had         an impact on our employment levels.
Throughout our collaboration with         your research team we         have been able to sustain the employment of several of our employees and         to create four new         posts, no mean feat for an SME with only 15 employees in total.'
MAST concludes [G]:     `...the fundamental research of your research team at the University         of Bath had a major         impact on our initial work on adsorption, and continues to have a         significant impact on our         ongoing work in the field of advanced adsorbents which now encompasses         fields as diverse as         biomedical blood filtration, chemical and biological defence and         catalysis alongside the original         air purification studies.'
