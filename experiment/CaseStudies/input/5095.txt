     From 2005 CCEd established itself as a key source of historical       information on Anglican       churches and clergy; in 2009 CCEd2 made the steadily expanding       body of data more readily       intelligible and accessible to non-academic users.
Both database and       website are used by       genealogists across the globe (notably in the US and Australasia), by       local historians and by       non-academic church historians, averaging for example roughly 8,600 unique       individual       monthly visitors over the first 10 months of 2013 (5.1).
Users also       provide data and more       discursive material to CCEd, some using it as a platform for their       own research (eg the       Texan genealogist Sarah Reveley [5.2]).
CCEd has been       promoted through advertising in       archives, relevant journals and websites, workshops and public       conferences, and an active       dialogue is maintained via email with many satisfied users (eg `your site       is of enormous help       to those researching and writing about local history at coalface level':       local historian Paul       Herrington, 21/7/2010) (5.1).
Other indicators of CCEd's       impact include the award of `Site of       the Week' by Family Tree Magazine; an article in The Guardian;       numerous links and       references in genealogical publications and websites (eg Peter Towey, My         Ancestor was an         Anglican Clergyman, and at key repositories such as The National       Archives (5.3).
The value       of CCEd to archives is apparent from a testimonial from an archivist at       Wiltshire and       Swindon Record Office, Steve Hobbs, who finds CCEd `of great value to       staff in a service       with a diocesan archive that covers two other counties (Berks and Dorset).
It has been used       in the writing of parish thumbnail accounts for our Community History       website which has       many hits by users around the world'.
(5.4) Record offices (such       as Lambeth Palace Library)       often refer users for assistance, or use CCEd to help explain       their holdings.
On 13 August 2008 Burns appeared on Who Do You Think You Are?
Patsy         Kensit, for an       extended sequence (also featuring CCEd , part of it accessible on       the BBC website): the       episode attracted 6.9 million viewers (a 30% audience share) for its first       of 10 showings on       the BBC; it is now available on DVD.
Burns has also appeared in another       major television       event, his research on Thaxted underpinning a key part of a revisionist       account of Gustav       Holst in Tony Palmer's film In the Bleak Midwinter for the BBC (5.6)       first broadcast with       considerable press coverage at Easter 2011, and since issued on DVD.
Burns' further research on Bethnal Green parish following the Kensit       programme (3.2)       together with 3.1 and 3.3-6 informed his collaboration as       co-investigator on an equal basis       with PI Prof John Wolffe (OU) in the innovative AHRC-funded Knowledge       Transfer       Fellowship Building on History: The Church in London (2009-11),       assisted by research       officers John Maiden (OU) and Lucinda Matthews-Jones (King's).
Working       with the Diocese       of London and Lambeth Palace Library, the project has significantly       increased awareness       among both clergy and laity of the nineteenth-century history of the       Diocese as a resource       for contemporary Anglicanism in London and its interactions with the wider       community.
Burns' research was disseminated through a wide range of activity,       summarised in the       project report (5.7) sent to all bishops and training officers in       the Church in England as part       of a wider dissemination strategy which also saw seminars held for       dioceses in the south       east (Lambeth Palace 2011), the south west (Salisbury 2011), and the       midlands       (Birmingham 2011) and coverage in the church press (5.8): i) more       than 30 events       organised at deanery level for clergy and laity where presentations       offered specific contexts       for current work; ii) special events such as a `Parish history day' (at       which an audience of       more than fifty amateur researchers and clerics from across the country       were advised on       resources for and approaches to writing parish histories &#8212; including the       DVD resource The         English Parish Church, to which Burns contributed &#8212; which the team       repeated for the       London Metropolitan Archives outreach programme) and Schools events, one       of which       stimulated innovative use of a church as a teaching resource at Christ       Church Primary       School, Hampstead; iii) Contributions to local and community events, such       as Burns' lecture       at the 2011 anniversary celebrations of St Matthew Bethnal Green; iv) a       website which       continues to offer papers by the project team and other resources       including a detailed       account of relevant material in Lambeth Palace Library (effectively a new       front end, for which       Burns led development), and advice directed both at parish historians and       those planning       church work; v) work with ordinands in the diocese, demonstrating how the       history of their       parishes could lead them to see their own challenges in a new light.
Burns' work on Bethnal       Green was among that which attracted most interest among key diocesan       personnel, the       Bishop of London singling it out both in his foreword to the project       report and citing it in his       Pentecost sermon in 2009 (5.7).
The team's work with senior clergy (bishops, archdeacons, and the       director of ordination       training) resulted in the development and implementation of a History       `Audit' in the diocese's       approach to Mission Action Planning, described on the diocesan website (5.10),       which is       now under consideration in at least one other diocese (Ely) for       implementation there; a       booklet describing the approach has been published in the Grove         pastoral pamphlets series       aimed at clerical CPD, and the diocese's director of ministerial training,       Neil Evans, testifies       that he has `seen a number of parishes benefit [from this] already' (5.8).
Elsewhere reaction       to the project was extremely positive, the vicar of St Mary Magdalene       Enfield and director of       post-ordination training for the Edmonton area, the Rev.
Gordon Giles,       describing its       contribution to his post-ordination training programme in Tottenham as `a       fantastic day', and       noting how attendance at the Parish History day helped his parish come to       a proper       understanding of the historic importance of his church, knowledge that       underpinned a       successful bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund for &#163;50,000, making vital       restoration work       possible.
(5.8) The director of Libraries, Archives and IT for the       National Church Institution of       the Church of England, Declan Kelly, notes that before the project Lambeth       Palace Library       was `a very insular and inward looking'; thanks to Building on History,       `now the library sees       very clearly the benefits of partnerships ... the project itself is       something that is now littered       across the Lambeth Palace Library website, from the home page right the       way through'.
(5.8) Contacts formed during the project helped underpin ongoing       relationships which will       ensure continuing interaction between Burns and the partner institutions.
