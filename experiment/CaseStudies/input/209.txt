     Faundez's research has had an impact on the development of legislation,       on policy-makers' understanding of legal reform and the implementation of       policy, and on the work of NGOs.
Impact on the development of legislation: The publication of Affirmative Action (3d) led to Faundez being invited by the ILO to assist the       Governments of Namibia and South Africa in drafting their affirmative       action legislation in employment.
The legislation was enacted in each       country in 1998.
It was the first affirmative action law enacted in a       developing country that was consistent with the principles of       international law, and continues to have an impact on the rights of       individuals in those countries today (5c).
This is reflected in the       positive evaluation of affirmative action by the US State Department in       its 2012 report (5g): it noted that `Namibia's Affirmative Action Act       strives to create equal employment opportunities, improve conditions for       the historically disadvantaged, and eliminate discrimination.
The       commission facilitates training programs, provides technical and other       assistance, and offers expert advice, information, and guidance on       implementing affirmative action in the work place.'
It also noted how       practical steps had been taken in different industries to embed       affirmative action and increase Namibian participation, with companies in       the fishing sector paying lower quota fees `if they operate       Namibian-flagged vessels that are based in Namibia, with crews that are       predominantly Namibian' and that the Minister of Mining and Energy `has       made clear that prospective mining companies must "indicate and show       commitment to empower previously disadvantaged Namibians" in their       applications for exploration and mining licenses."'
One empirical study       (5h) has noted that the affirmative impact legislation has had a positive       impact in both South Africa and Namibia, with enhanced representation of       people from designated groups in positions of responsibility, although       progress has been slower for women and people with disabilities.
Impact on policy-makers' understanding of legal reform: Faundez's       research on access to justice and on empowerment and democracy (see 3e-i)       has been influential in shaping the policy of inter-governmental       organisations, such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development       Bank, and of bilateral donor agencies, such as DFID.
It has contributed to       shifting the focus of legal reform projects from an almost exclusive focus       on an ideal-type vision of state institutions towards the wider       institutional approach that takes into account the plight of vulnerable       groups (5b).
On the basis of his work on democracy and legal empowerment (see e.g.
3h), in 2007 the ILO invited Faundez to carry out a study on whether       international labour standards, as embodied in relevant treaties and       recommendations, benefit workers in small and micro-enterprises, most of       which are in the informal sector.
The ILO published his resulting report       in 2008: A View on International Labour Standards, Labour Law and MSEs       (ILO: Geneva, Employment Working Paper No.
18).
This has provided valuable       research evidence to inform policy debates in this area.
It also achieved       a wide readership by being available to download from the ILO's website,       thus contributing to improved understanding of this area (5c).
His work on non-state justice was cited in the Organisation for Economic       Co-operation and Development's 2008 paper, Enhancing the Delivery of         Justice and Security.
Building on his body of work in the area of       non-state justice and security systems, in 2009 he (together with Alison       Lochhead and Lt. Col. Hugh Evans) was then requested by DFID to prepare a       report on these issues.
The resulting report, Lessons Learned From         Selected DFID Justice and Security Programmes&#8212;Study to Inform the White         Paper Process (2009) advised that `DFID should reaffirm its       comprehensive and pro-poor approach to justice and security, but should       ensure that its programmes are firmly linked to sustainable development       outcomes'.
This Report was used as one of the background papers for the       DFID's White Paper Eliminating World Poverty: Building our Common         Future (2009).
This White Paper drew specifically on the insight       that security and justice projects should not lose sight of the close link       existing between security, justice and sustainable economic growth (5f).
In 2010 Faundez was invited by the World Bank to participate in its Legal       Pluralism and Development Policy workshop.
This workshop led to the       publication of an edited collection, published by Cambridge University       Press in 2012, entitled Legal Pluralism and Development Scholars and         Practitioners in Dialogue.
This collection (see 3g), is the first       World Bank-sponsored publication to include articles by leading       international scholars and development practitioners with expertise in       legal pluralism, reflecting an important development in the provision of       research evidence to policy-makers (see 5b).
Following this publication, in 2012 the World Bank invited Faundez to be       part of a group of experts to address issues relating to the       justice-security-development nexus with special reference to fragile and       conflict-affected countries.
The aim of the project is to provide       practical guidance on how the World Bank might promote legitimate and       effective institutions to manage injustice and insecurity in fragile       states.
At the expert group meeting, held in November 2012, Faundez was       invited to comment on the practical problems arising from the efforts to       link justice with security and development concerns (5e).
His comments,       together with those of other participating experts, led to a revision of       the World Bank's discussion paper on this topic (The         Justice-Security-Development Nexus: Theory and Practice in Fragile and         Conflict-Affected States).
This discussion paper was published in       2013 by The Hague Journal on the Rule of Law (5(2)), a journal of       which Faundez is co-editor-in-chief, again reflecting his role in       promoting dialogue between practitioners and academia.
Faundez's 2003 Report for the DFID on non-state justice in Latin America       has also contributed to improve public understanding of the issues, having       been widely disseminated among development practitioners.
This Report is       also cited in the DFID's influential Briefing Note on Non-State         Justice and Security Systems (DFID 2004), which continues to be a       key reference point in this field (5a).
Impact on the evaluation of legal reform projects: Faundez's       research into the design and scope of legal reform projects has also       provided evidence to inform practice and the implementation of policy (see       5b).
One example of a project benefiting from Faundez's expertise is the       Capacity Building of the Sudan Judiciary Project, funded by a Multi-Donor       Trust Fund administered by the World Bank.
The aim of the project was to       strengthen judicial independence so as to enable the judiciary to       effectively and fairly apply the law.
Faundez was invited by the World       Bank to carry out a Mid-Term Review on the implementation of the project.
Drawing on his experience evaluating justice reform projects for the World       Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (see in particular 3c and f),       his report, Capacity Building of the Sudan Judiciary (Sudan Multi         Donor Trust Fund) Mid-Term Review (2008), highlighted the problems       inherent in the design of justice reform projects in contexts where the       institutional environment is fragile and external intervention on matters       concerning the judiciary are regarded as sensitive because of the       authoritarian nature of the regime and the close link between legal and       religious principles.
Faundez also noted that the project had greatly       underestimated the difficulties involved in delivering training programmes       aimed at improving the capacity of officials working in the justice       system.
The project was adjusted accordingly and training has formed an       important part of Phase II of the project (5i).
Impact on non-governmental organisations: Faundez's research on       community justice and legal pluralism has also influenced the work of       NGOs.
Drawing on his research (in particular 3e, f and h), he helped       Amnesty International understand the complex legal issues relating to       indigenous peoples in Latin America.
In particular, his research helped       Amnesty to clarify aspects of Bolivia's legislation relating to the       relationship between state judicial systems and dispute resolution       mechanisms employed by indigenous peoples in rural areas (Ley de         Deslinde Jurisdiccional).
As a consequence, in 2010 Amnesty issued       an open letter to the Plurinational Legislative Assembly of Bolivia, which       identifies the issues that legislators should take into account when       defining the jurisdiction of various parallel systems of justice (5d).
Since 2009, Faundez has been actively involved in the activities of the       World Justice Project, an NGO based in Washington that publishes the       prestigious Rule of Law Index and constitutes a multinational and       multidisciplinary initiative to strengthen the Rule of Law worldwide.
He       participated in their major research project on access to justice, which       culminated in the publication of two edited collections (Global         Perspectives on the Rule of Law and Marginalised Communities and         Access to Justice) in the series Law, Development and         Globalization, of which he is the sole editor (see 5k).
Faundez also       supported the World Justice Project in a study on the use of indicators       for measuring the impact of rule of law and governance.
The findings of       this study were published as a special issue of The Hague Journal on         the Rule of Law in 2011 (see 3g and 5k).
His impact on this       organisation was reflected in their invitation to him to serve as a       Moderator for their Rule of Law Keynote Panel at the 2010 Latin America       and Caribbean Rule of Law Conference: expressing their admiration for       Faundez's long-standing multidisciplinary commitment to upholding the Rule       of Law, they acknowledged his role as `an inspirational leader' and his       undertaking of `a diverse array of noble and noteworthy causes, all of       which have helped to promote effective Rule of Law for the development of       communities of opportunity and equity' (5j).
