     Over a period of twenty years our fundamental research into root-shoot       signalling in relation to       drought has informed the development of a range of technologies through       which our science has       been applied to deliver environmental and commercial benefits in crop       productionA.
Key elements       of this translational work have been undertaken directly by Davies and his       team at Lancaster.
This       is reflected in the diversity as well as the scale of external support for       our research, which has won       support from multiple funders totalling more than &#163;3M, including DEFRA       (2003, 1.2M; 2006,       &#163;100K; 2009, &#163;220K), EU (2000, &#8364;400K, 2009, &#8364;220K, 2010, &#8364;495K, 2011,       &#8364;1.2M), CIMMYT 2012       $1.2 M and HDC (2008, &#163;70K and &#163;28K).
This funding has been based on our       international       network of more than 30 research collaborations and 20 partnerships with       companiesA.
The global significance and reach of the impact from our fundamental       research (Section 2) is       amplified through the translational research undertaken by others working       with Lancaster.
There       are many examplesA, however we will focus here on examples from       Australia and, especially,       China.

2008 &#8212; Zhang's key role in improving irrigation practices in         Chinese agriculture leads him to         being listed by Nature in 2008 as one of `Five crop scientists who can         change the world'.
Marris         (Nature 2008)G writes "Zhang moved to Hong Kong after           several years at Lancaster and now           travels throughout China talking about research on deficit irrigation           as a way to improve           agricultural efficiency......
Thanks to Zhang and others, farmers in           northern China have learned           to use less water.
In north-west China, for example, the amount of           water used for irrigation has           almost halved from what it was a decade ago".
2012 Kang is elected to the Chinese Engineering Academy in         2012, largely for his work on the         application of Deficit Irrigation techniques in the driest regions of         the countryF.
Both the Australian and Chinese researchers fully acknowledge Lancaster       as the inspiration for       their irrigation work.
For example, Stoll et al (2000)H state "The         idea of using PRD as a tool to         manipulate water deficit responses in this way had its origin in the         observation that root derived         abscisic acid was important in determining grapevine stomatal         conductance (Loveys, CSIRO-Australia)         and the demonstration by three researchers, Gowing, Davies and Jones,         working at the         same time at the University of Lancaster with apple trees, (Gowing et         al., 1993) that split root         plants could be used to show that many of the effects of water stress         could be explained in terms-of the transport of chemical signals from         root to shoot without changes in water relations ".
Kriedemann and GoodwinG go on to note "We have been able to         develop a commercially viable         irrigation system for grapevines which had been designed to reduce         vegetative vigour and improve         water use efficiency.
We have called the technique Partial Rootzone         Drying (PRD) and it requires         that the roots are simultaneously exposed to both wet and dry zones.....
Implementation of the         partial rootzone drying technique is simple, requiring only that         irrigation systems are modified to         allow alternate wetting and drying of part of the rootzone.
Commercial-scale trials are currently         being evaluated and further studies on the physiological mechanisms         involved in modifying water         use efficiency in a range of horticultural plants is continuing"     Work at CSIRO has continued, with Davies a collaborator in several of       these consortia.
While the       economic focus of the wine industry in Australia has changed in recent       years and driven irrigation       research in another direction, progressive vineyards across three       continents are deploying PRD to       improve water use efficiency and wine qualityI,J.
The application of PRD and deficit irrigation more generally in China has       grown quickly.
Water is       an especially pressing environmental, economic and social issue in China,       where the population of       more than 1.3 billion people, approximately 20% of the world population,       depends on only 7% of       the world's water supply.
Almost 60% of Chinese agricultural land (approx.
69.6 m ha) is irrigated.
As noted above, exploitation of Lancaster's research in China began with       the joint grant to Zhang       and Kang in 1996.
Their research has been continuously supported by       Chinese funders since that       date, and LEC continues to contribute direct inputs to those research       programs, via, for example,       substantial RCUK support focussed on delivering our research into Asia       (2008, &#163;25K; 2009, &#163;27K,       2012 &#163;180k) culminating in the RCUK China Bridge in 2009 (&#163;1.3M).
Because       of LEC's continuing       collaboration with Kang at the Chinese Agricultural University and Zhang       (recently appointed as       Director of a State Key Lab in Agrobiotechnology in Hong Kong) we remain       closely and directly       involved with the on-going development and application of PRD-based       systems in Chinese       agriculture.
To illustrate the reach and significance of the impacts       delivered through the application       of PRD-based approaches, we focus here on well quantified impacts in       northern China.
We are       aware of the techniques being applied to improve irrigation in Gansu,       Shaanxi and Xingjiang       Provinces, but the best documented application comes from Gansu where       environmental       protection and restoration are high priorities for government, as       described in the letter from the       Gansu Provincial Department of Water ResourceK, "Shiyang         River Catchment is a typical         ecologically fragile region with agriculture land of "no grow without         irrigation".
The proportion of         water usage for agriculture in the area is over 90%.
The water shortage         and the over-exploitation         of groundwater has caused serious ecological and environmental problems,         such as         groundwater level drop, vegetation degradation, shrinkage of oasis,         desertification, and soil         salinization and alkalization."
The use of PRD-based technologies in       Gansu provides a focussed       example, not only of impact of Lancaster research on agricultural       production, but also far wider       socio-economic and environmental benefits.
Each of these three       inter-linked areas of impact is       described below.
a. Quantified impacts on crop production and resource use efficiency     Techniques arising from the further development of PRD by Kang and Zhang       are now used over       an area of approximately 120,000ha in the Wuwei district alone.C       According to the Water       Resource Bureau, Wuwei City "The results for individual crops are:         maize, water saving 50% with         yield reduction at 11%; apple and wine grape, water saving 10-18% and         35-40% respectively with         no yield reduction for both crops; cotton, water saving 30% with seed         cotton yield reduction only at         5%, but with much higher quality of lint cotton yield"C       In other crops "reduction of water use for         tomato and chili production is 1530m3/ha and         1920m3/ha for winter to spring season and 180         m3/ha and 285m3/ha for         over the winter season respectively, while the yields were maintained         unchanged"L. This scale of reductions in the use of       irrigation water use leads to an estimated total       saving of around 80-100 million cubic metres of irrigation water per annum       in this one catchment       alone.
More recently, Prof Kang notes that similar savings have been       reported in the Beijing areaE.
b Economic benefits of improved water use.
The economic benefits of using PRD-based technologies clearly varies       between crop but, for       example, in a case study with cotton Tang et al (2010) showed not only       reduced water use but also       increased quality and decreased harvesting costs, leading to a 30%       increase in profit per unit       water usedL.
The International Commission on Irrigation and       Drainage (ICID) in recognising Prof       Kang's contributions and achievements to water-savings in agricultureM       noted "He and Prof Zhang         Jianhua (Hong Kong Baptist University) developed a new irrigation method         systematically, so         called controlled alternate partial root-zone irrigation (CAPRI), in         1996 to improve crop water use         efficiency by exploiting the plant physiological responses to partial         soil drying in their root zone"M       and goes on to note that farm income in one district where the technology       had been applied       (Hongdong in Shanxi Province) farm income increased byffe510,566,800 (c.       &#163;1.1M at current       exchange rates) due to increased yield and reduced expenditure of       irrigation water, plus less       obvious savings, like reduce electricity costs for pumping ground-waterM.
The research has also       led to new patentsF and commercial systems to deliver PRD and       related irrigation approaches.
c. Reducing the environmental impact of agriculture.
The ICID document highlighting Kang's achievement in northern China also       describes PRD-based       technologies being used in grape, maize and cotton, as one of six key       approaches to protect and       restore the whole Shiyanghe river basin, an area about 4.16&#215;104       km2.
They note that "Due to its         arid climate, limited water resources and some inappropriate         water-related human activities, the         area has developed serious loss of vegetation, and gradual soil         salinization and desertification..."M       The use of PRD-based technologies have contributed to significant       environmental improvements,       for example ".. the groundwater level of Qingtu Lake on the downstream         Shiyang River raised 0.17         metre compared with that in 2007, a significant improvement in         ecological environment".K Water       not used in agriculture has been used to irrigate the Gansu national       ecological security barrier,       supporting the re-establishment of native vegetation.
Although northern China provides the most advanced and quantifiable       examples of the multiple       environmental and economic impacts of PRD-based approaches, the methods       are now       increasingly being adopted in other parts of China, in southern Europe and       elsewhere.
The       documented reach and significance of the benefits of PRD in in China and       elsewhere highlight the       potential scale of impacts as the technique becomes established in other       regions...
