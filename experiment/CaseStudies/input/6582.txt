     The impact arising from the research was enabled through the KTP projects       referred to above.
The results of the research enabled the development of a software package       which could:     A. tie together a number of existing electric motor design packages       within one framework,       allowing each to be used to its full potential but together rather than       separately.
B. so far as possible, not require detailed technical understanding (from       the user) of each of       the individual packages.
C. so far as possible, be intuitive in its use and not require highly       developed programming       skills.
A number of key features were introduced in the design of the system as       an impact of the initial       research.
A modified flow chart structure was used at the top level, since       this was known to be       accessible and understood by users.
When more detail was required, and       number of options were       provided, depending on the level of the user's technical understanding.
For those with limited       technical ability, a revised/expanded form of flowchart was used; for       those with limited       algorithmic/programming skills, common scripting was used across all       integrated packages; for       those technically experienced in any or all of the integrated packages,       the actual syntax and       operational methodologies of those packages could be embedded.
The initial       research showed       that such an approach should be successful and indeed it was when the       various prototype       versions came to be tested.
These principles were extended and updated       through the various       alpha and beta versions of the developed software.
The end product, known as "Motor-Lab", was produced in 2012 and refined       for final release in       2013.
The following is taken from the company's literature:     "MDL's unique combined electromagnetic and thermal modelling tool is         the first of its kind in the         marketplace; no other modelling tool offers equivalent functionality.
Motor-LAB was developed to         enable rapid and accurate modelling of any permanent magnet AC motor         over the entire         operational envelope.
It is specifically designed to aid the design of         motors for traction         applications.
With Motor-LAB, engineers can create efficiency maps, plot         torque/speed         characteristics, study the continuous and peak thermally constrained         operational envelope and         analyse performance over driving cycles.
It is fast, easy to use and the         techniques have been         experimentally verified.
Motor-LAB has an intuitive user interface: data         is produced in a simple         format that can easily be exported to Matlab, Microsoft Excel and other         applications.
A wide variety         of graphs can be generated and a number of publication-quality output         formats are supported."
Marketing and selling of Motor-LAB has only just begun but early sales       are promising and the       company has very high hopes for this product and has invested heavily in       its marketing.
Initial       reviews are excellent and significant sales, and subsequent increase in       company turnover, are       expected.
Alongside the financial returns from Motor-LAB has been a fundamental       shift in the company's       business approach.
It is no longer necessary to write individual, somewhat       fine-tuned, software       solutions for each customer.
Instead, Motor-LAB can be shipped to all       customers with features       relevant to them enabled/disabled as appropriate.
The charging model is       then applied consistently       on the basis of what services are offered.
This leads to a more       transparent portfolio of services       and better customer perception of the MDL `catalogue'.
Feedback in       response to this new strategy       has been excellent and the customer base is expanding rapidly.
Finally,       in-house training for both       customers and MDL staff is also simplified and made more efficient.
In the course of the design of the universal package, a separate,       specialist package was       developed with a particular focus on building and analysing an efficiency       map for electric motor       design.
The package known as "Eff-Map" was produced and marketed in 2011.
A final spin-off from the research collaboration has been the development       to market of the `FE-Therm'       module within the existing Motor-CAD package.
FE-Therm provides increased       detail on       conduction heat transfer in various components; it can be used to analyse       conduction heat transfer       for complex geometries such as multi-layer interior magnet motor rotors       and to calibrate analytical       lumped circuit models, thus improving accuracy.
These developments are significant since MDL have a number of         customers and collaborative         partners all over the world.
They are recognised as the world-leaders in         their (this) particular field         of specialism.
Other companies offer small parts of the MDL service in         isolation but none of them         can match the integrated approach to motor design that MDL can now         offer.
Their global influence         continues to grow.
