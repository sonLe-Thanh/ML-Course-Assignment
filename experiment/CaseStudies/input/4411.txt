     Cambridge English Language Assessment       Cambridge English Language Assessment is the world leader in the provision       of English Language       examinations to 4 million candidates per year in 2,700 examination centres       in 113 countries.
In       addition to providing examinations, Cambridge English Language Assessment       engages in       research, teacher education, and publication of materials and research       reports.
Key to its       examinations are the assessment level descriptors that provide the       benchmarks for examiners.
These descriptors relate to six levels of achievement identified in the       Common European       Framework of Reference for Language.
Those descriptors do not include       reference to metaphor or       figurative language.
As a result of the first research project described       above, a decision has been       taken to change the descriptors to include those relating to metaphor use,       as appropriate for the       different levels.
As an illustration, the following descriptors have been recommended by       Littlemore and accepted       by CELA for B2 and C2 (source 2):       B2 Learners should be able to make use of a limited number of         conventional and creative         open-class metaphors.
They should be able to use metaphors for         evaluative purposes and for         dramatic effect and start to use them for discourse organising purposes.
They should be starting to         use personification metaphors more extensively.
Metaphorical clusters         are more in evidence at this         level.
Some are coherent, whereas others contain mixed metaphors.
C2 Learners should be able to use metaphors with consistent         appropriate phraseology and         collocations, use non-conventional, creative collocations and make         creative use of direct metaphor         to present their evaluations.
They should be able to produce a high         number of semi-coherent         clusters, possibly containing mixed metaphors and peripheral response.
They may use         personification metaphors as part of extended analogies and in         combination with metonymy, and         they may be able to convey sarcasm through metaphor and metonymy.
ELT Professionals       The impact of the research goes beyond the Cambridge organisation to       language teachers and       examiners more generally, especially examiners using the European       Framework.
The       recommendations for B2 shown above are particularly important because B2       is the standard level       of English proficiency required for entry into language programmes at       European universities.
The       research report recommends that examiners should give credit for       expressivity rather than       accuracy at level B2 to allow learners scope to experiment with new forms       of language and to       demonstrate their skill in using language creatively.
This represents a       change in approaches to       assessing language and avoids excluding from language programmes highly       skilled students who       are prepared to take risks with metaphor use.
As an indication of the       reach of the research,       Cambridge ESOL reports that Research Notes issue 47 was downloaded       707 times between       February 2012 and 30 September 2012 (source 3).
The results of the third project above (funded by the Spanish Ministry of       Education) have been       used to revise teaching materials used in preparing students for Erasmus       exchanges to include       training in metaphor recognition and comprehension (source 4).
The British Council       The British Council is a leading source of information for language       teachers and professionals who       communicate on a regular basis with people whose first language is not       English.
Its website       receives around 20 million hits per year from people accessing its advice.
Littlemore's research       produced a report and a series of interactive web pages.
Both the report (source 5) and the interactive web pages are available on       the British Council       website through both http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/publications       and       http://englishagenda.britishcouncil.org/sites/ec/files/B458%20ELTRP%20Report%20- %20Littlemore_final.pdf.
According to the British Council, the publication was viewed on the       website `English Agenda', 62 times by 43 people between May 7th 2013 (when       the publication was       uploaded to the site) and 8th July 2013.
The total number of page views on       the entire site during       that time was 89,190.
On `Teaching English', the publication was viewed       110 times by 83 people       between May 7th 2013 (when the publication was uploaded to the site) and       8th July.
The total       number of page views on the entire site during that time was 3,512,483       (source 6).
This research has enhanced the advice that the British Council is able to       offer.
For the first time,       information and recommendations about metaphor use in academic settings       are available for users       to access.
This enhances the Council's service to its users, and thereby       its worldwide reputation       for reliable and constructive advice.
Other users of the research are       teachers in UK universities       who interact with international students and teachers outside the UK who       are preparing students to       study at British universities.
Littlemore has received emails from a number of teachers who have used       this website.
Here is a       quote from one of them, a language teacher and teacher trainer working in       Estonia:     I have used the research paper 'How to make yourself understood by         international students: The         role of metaphor in academic tutorials' in two courses I teach at the         University of Tartu: 1)         Teaching in English at University and 2) English for Academic Purposes         for Academics.
Using the         videos presented in this paper has been incredibly useful for additional         insight of the small things         which causes misunderstandings...
Using this material has been very         useful for these two courses         I teach and the participants which are enrolled, mainly to boost their         confidence of their language         usage, and make them aware that misunderstandings often find their         origin elsewhere and they         need to explore these, or question these.
This material will remain part         of the instructional material         for these courses.
As well as the published reports, these findings have been presented in       invited keynote and       plenary lectures given at teachers' conferences in the UK, Spain,       Montenegro and Japan between       2009 and 2012 (sources 8-12).
Evidence that the findings have changed the       practice of teachers       and teacher trainers comes from correspondence with participants at these       conferences outlining       how they are using Littlemore's ideas and the website materials in their       teaching and training       (source 7).
