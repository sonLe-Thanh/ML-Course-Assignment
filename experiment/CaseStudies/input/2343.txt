     In the past twenty-five years there has been a fundamental shift in the       legal and constitutional       foundations of government relations with the indigenous peoples in the       common law jurisdictions of       Canada and Australasia.
McHugh's work has been pivotal and highly       influential in securing the       political changes that these not uncontroversial legal changes have       generated and continue to       generate.
McHugh's work has influenced national legal systems and       political development in a       manner and to an extent rare for a legal and historical scholar.
Much of       this influence occurs at the       high-policy level in the proverbial corridors of power where governments       strategise the       management of claims (in court presentation as well as more generally).
This impact is less       outwardly visibly though in its effect much more significant than the more       usual `impact' setting of       citation by fellow academics and other more public forms.
Over the REF period McHugh's impact includes the following:            Citation and appearance before courts and tribunals in Canada and New         Zealand as         independent constitutional and historical expert;       Retention by the governments of Canada and New Zealand to provide         advice in the         management of land claims;       Providing the underpinning concepts embodied within New Zealand's         Marine and Coastal Area         (Takutai Moana) Act 2011;       The recognition by Commonwealth courts of the doctrine of common law         aboriginal rights         which renders tribal land rights justiciable in local courts.
The cases and issues in question are high-profile, often with associated       media coverage.
Claims       involve sums of billions of dollars and considerable political sensitivity       involving a history of difficult       relations and tribal distrust of government and claims of an extent and       nature that in the past two       decades have proven to be electorally costly for governments.
One such claim was the Canadian Ross River Kaska Dena land claim.
In       Justice Gower's 91-page       decision[1], McHugh is cited 108 times.
Justice Gower accepts the evidence       supplied by McHugh       in reaching his conclusion on the substantive issues &#8212; for example "Having         generally accepted Dr.         McHugh's expert opinion evidence that the relevant provision was not         intended to have justiciable         legal force and effect "at that time", I am left struggling to discern         any reason how or why the         relevant provision could have subsequently acquired legal force and         effect in order to be         enforceable in this Court."
[para139] "Dr. McHugh's evidence, as         a legal historian, was not         significantly challenged on cross-examination."
[para 149] "This         is an important distinction, and it is         best explained by Dr. McHugh in his text, Aboriginal Title, The Modern         Jurisprudence of Tribal         Land Rights ..." [para 149] "Dr. McHugh opined, and I accept,         that the honour of the Crown would         not have been considered a justiciable principle at that time and in the         specific context of the 1870         Order ..." [para 150].
Another is the Alderville claim in southern Ontario.
The Head of the       Toronto Office of the Aboriginal       Litigation Team of the Canadian Department of Justice writes[2]:       "Dr. McHugh is currently acting as an expert on Alderville First Nation         et al.
v. Canada which is         presently in trial.
The litigation involves a number of First Nations         who are contesting the validity of         the 1923 William Treaties on the basis of Crown misconduct.
The         plaintiffs seek damages in         excess of $1 billion...
It raises issues of national importance and,         necessarily, political sensitivity.
"The Crown's preparation and argument in this case relies strongly on         Dr. McHugh's expertise         associated with his published work, including Aboriginal Societies and         the Common Law (2004),         Aboriginal Title (2011) and his paper "The Politics of Historiography         and the Taxonomies of the         Colonial Past: Law, History and the Tribes" (2011).
Dr. McHugh's unique         expertise as a legal         historian of imperial and early national Canada &#8212; and specifically the         Crown's relationship to         aboriginal peoples &#8212; plays an important role in the Crown's defence in         the claim...         "...through his research interests and published works Dr. McHugh has         made a significant impact         on the way the Attorney General of Canada responds to litigation         involving First Nations."
The former Senior General Counsel and team leader of the Aboriginal Law       Litigation Section,       Department of Justice, Canada, Ontario Regional Office, as well as       detailing a number of cases for       which McHugh is or has provided expert testimony (including The Douglas       Treaties (1851) claims       on Vancouver Island, BC, and the T'kemlups (British Columbia interior)       claim on pre-confederation       Indian policy in BC, both current), speaks more generally about McHugh's       impact on the DOJ       strategy[3]:     "It is not the same as the positioning of self-interested parties in         private litigation.
It requires a         sense of the overriding public interest as well as the accommodation of         the rightful sensitivities of         First Nations claimants and maintenance of consistency in the Crown's         position across a series of         proceedings in different parts of the country.
Professor         McHugh's published work, supported and         detailed by his expert reports in particular proceedings, has had a         direct impact on enabling the         Attorney-General of Canada to address this task"     McHugh's work has also had impact in New Zealand.
This began pre-period,       most notably by the       Court of Appeal's indication in the Ngati Apa case (2003) that       there might be residual Maori       property rights around the NZ coastline, an argument pioneered by McHugh's       work.
In period, as       well as his contribution to individual cases, his work has informed       legislation and has become part       of the context in which issues concerning indigenous peoples rights are       judged:     [text removed from publication]     Legal advisor to the Prime Minister of New Zealand[4]     "Professor McHugh's work has had a very significant impact in this       country.
Indeed he is       undoubtedly regarded as the most important commentator on Native title       issues that New Zealand       has produced.
In New Zealand, moreover, these questions are not in any way       marginal but are       pivotal to national political and legal developments, given the very high       profile of Maori historic       claims and the fact that about 15% of the national population is Maori.
The foreshore and seabed       issue, in which Paul's work was especially influential, was a major       national controversy which       caused substantial protests and fundamental changes to national politics."
