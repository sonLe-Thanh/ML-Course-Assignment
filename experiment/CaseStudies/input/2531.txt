     The impact achieved by this body of work from 2008 onwards builds on the       success of activities       undertaken by the Alliance (through CEHS) and Development Workshop (DW) at       the end of their       collaborative DfID-funded project on urban land issues in Angola.
The       first of these       accomplishments was influencing the Lei de Terras de Angola       (Angola Land Law) of 2004,       primarily through providing important empirical evidence for       representation to parliament by civil       society organisations.
The Land Law was the first in Angola to be opened       up to public consultation       and paved the way for alternative rights to urban land for the poor       majority to be recognised       through subsequent state regulation and strategies.
DW (see 5.1, below)       has since been invited to       work as Government Advisor on urban land regulations and testifies that...       "At the time of writing [July 2013]...key elements [of the       law], such as the creation of special land       reserves, have been implemented at a wide scale across the country".
Subsequent to the new regulations being published, there still remained       extremely limited       professional experience and capacity in urban land development in       post-conflict Angola, both       within government and the private sector.
There was therefore a need to       build on the opportunity       for real change provided by the new regulations through demonstration in       practice.
The in-situ       training that DW and the Alliance provided for stakeholders from       government, the private sector       and NGOs in 2005-2006 led, by design, to a number of pilot projects in       urban development;       implemented initially by DW for the Provincial Government in Huambo, and       followed by further       urban expansion and development, continuing up to the present day.
Described by a       representative of the World Bank (see 5.2) as "extremely important         `learning-by-doing' for the         government of Angola", these include Camussamba in F&#225;tima and a       housing reserve in Calima.
As corroborated by [text removed for publication] DW (see 5.1), the       capacity building strategy       developed jointly by the Alliance and DW has been "very effective"       and "resulted in the         implementation of land management and housing demonstration projects in         five provinces and the         training of administrators and technicians from over 40 municipalities         from 15 of Angola's 18         provinces.
Demonstration projects implemented by DW with advice from         CEHS in the province of         Huambo have introduced real changes in [the] practice of land         management.
The municipal         administration of Huambo has developed a set of administrative         procedures based on the principle         of incremental land tenure improvement [and] introduced         "occupation licences" that provide         families with security of tenure and allow them the time to obtain full         titles."
The Alliance's CEHS has been described by Huambo's [text removed for       publication] Urbanism,       Planning and Environment as "important partners for the Municipal         Administration.
[Together with       DW] they are assisting [us to] modernise urban management in the         city, implement more proactive         planning and increase land use control" (see 5.3).
Impacts include       DW being awarded funding from       the United States Agency for International Development to prepare a Draft       Operations Manual on       land rights, published in May 2008 as the Formalization of Land Rights         in Rural and Peri Urban         Settings in Angola.
In addition, Dutch Embassy funding (2007 to       present) has enabled DW to       replicate the experience in other provinces, leading to: the development       of a manual which is now       in its 3rd edition (2011) and has been used for training several hundred       government staff in Bie,       Huambo and Benguela and at the National Training Institute for Local       Administration; the creation       of a 2,000+ item, virtual library on urban land issues in Angola (www.bibliotecaterra.angonet.org); and       the piloting of purpose-designed (open source) cadastral software to       better facilitate land use       control by local government.
Because they offer opportunities for a planned alternative to peri-urban       sprawl, urban expansion       plans have attracted private sector development.
Strategic planning work       for DW by the Alliance       (through CEHS) in Edinburgh in 2010 directly stimulated the `spin off' of       successful new private       sector enterprises, for example, Pafil Ltd and Navimbuando Ltd, the latter       now the only local       company in central Angola offering services inclusive of topographic       survey, the design of new       urban layouts and the demarcation of plots.
As well as operating       commercially, these companies       also work for provincial and local authorities in new urban development,       land use management and       infrastructure provision.
As a result of these activities, urban       residents, newly empowered by land       rights, feel more secure in their homes and are more likely to invest,       both economically and       emotionally, in their properties and wider neighbourhoods.
Although the planned upgrading of existing neighbourhoods is more of a       challenge, it remains a       priority, including for local government.
In June 2013, Jenkins and Smith       were invited by Huambo       City Administration to assist in devising a strategic action plan for       urban development, including the       recognition of land rights for existing residents.
Previously, in 2012,       Jenkins had assisted DW plan       scaling-up urban land projects to programme level, with the local       authority requesting strategic       planning assistance.
In addition, at national level, in September 2011,       Jenkins was invited as one       of only five international experts to contribute to a workshop organised       by the United Nations, local       NGO, HABITAT Angola, and the Angolan Government on formulating urban       development strategy,       leading [text removed for publication] HABITAT Angola (see 5.4) to write:       "Prof. Jenkins brings a lot of practical experience from Mozambique and         Brazil, which are         important countries for Angola to learn from.
His advice was... very         much practical in relation to the         real problems here in Angola.
Myself and colleagues from government and         Habitat Angola         appreciate such advice, it provides many ideas for concrete action.
[The workshop] was a very         important event and helped shape policy and... urban programs for 2012         and subsequent years".
Prior access to the findings from the most recent research in Mozambique       (Home Space in the       African City) was made available to the World Bank, on request, in 2012.
This was to assist in       preparing a second urban project with Maputo City municipality.
The [text       removed for publication]       World Bank's ProMaputo II Programme has said of the research:       "I think it represents a milestone in the field of informal settlements         studies in Maputo and the wider         African context, ... [giving] dignity to the inhabitants of         these peri-urban areas, acknowledging their         fundamental contribution, pride and ownership in the city development".
(See 5.5).
Heightened       interest in the research has led to requests for Jenkins to speak at, for       example, the Planning       Africa Conference (in Durban, September 2012, as the ending keynote       speaker) and as part of the       Future of Cities Distinguished Lecture Series (run by the Oxford       University Sustainable Urban       development programme) in June 2013.
Public awareness of the work has been widened through the 2012       documentary African Urban         Dreams.
Produced by the award-winning Scottish Documentary Institute       (see 5.6), the film       premiered at the DOCKANEMA film festival in Mozambique in September 2012.
It opened a       debate on the Right to Housing during the 1st Urban Festival in Maputo       (April 2013) and has been       screened in Tripoli, Ramallah and Agadir by the British Council and on       World Architecture Day in       Denmark.
It has also been selected for screening in 15 major European       cities as part of the       Transeuropa festival of culture, arts and politics, as well as in Croatia,       Austria, Bolivia and Spain.
