     The impact has been at two levels: in influencing the policy debate, and       thus improving the quality of argument and decision; and through this in       stimulating competition to deliver lower prices for consumers which will       affect all households.
Both the energy regulator, Ofgem, and the water regulator, Ofwat, have       recently taken fundamental decisions about the structure of household       choice in their sectors.
Ofgem has introduced a number of measures since a       review of the market in 2008 to encourage more consumer switching.
CCP's       research on consumer behaviour, and analysis of potential response by       firms and consumers to Ofgem's proposed changes, has fed into and informed       those debates.
These have occurred in two distinct areas:            Concern about consumers who switch to less good deals.
The research by         Wilson and Waddams received media coverage and caught the attention of a         number of policy makers (S4, S6, S7), including the energy regulator         (S5).
Ofgem was sufficiently concerned and sceptical about the work         showing consumer errors that they commissioned their own study, which         both confirmed even `worse' results than those in Wilson and Waddams         Price and led to greater understanding of the nature of `active' and         `passive' consumers.
This has led to a number of important initiatives         to improve the ability of consumers to make good decisions, implemented         after the Energy Supply Probe in 2009.
To protect consumers who were not switching, Ofgem introduced tighter         controls on company behaviour, in particular introducing a         non-discrimination clause which prevented companies offering better         deals to consumers in areas where they had not previously been the         incumbent to encourage switching.
Although the regulator initially         decided to implement the non- discrimination clauses, despite         acknowledging the advice of "three academics" (including Waddams) not to         do so, the regulator did not renew them, largely because of arguments         based on the work of Hviid and Waddams in demonstrating the potentially         perverse effects of these clauses (S8, S9).
An independent expert         (Littlechild response at         https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/retail-market-review-updated-domestic-proposals)         estimated that the damage done by the non discrimination clauses         amounted to &#163;10bn over 6 years, averaging &#163;400 for each household in the         UK and adding around 6% to energy bills.
In the water sector, on the basis of CCP's work on consumer choice in       newly opened markets, Ofwat invited CCP researchers to explore the       benefits of allowing companies to offer a choice of tariffs to household       consumers for whom they are a monopoly supplier.
As a result of the       commissioned paper, based on evidence from the CCP research programme       cited above, the Board decided in September 2011 not to permit companies       to offer such a choice, thus avoiding potential harm to consumers.
The       commissioned paper has been published on the Ofwat website.
Within the UK the route of the research in influencing impact has been       through invitations to give advice to Government and agencies across a       range of areas and departments.
Members of the team have been consulted on       issues of consumer choice by the Cabinet Office's Behavioural Insights       Team (January 2011); by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills       through membership of the Economic Strategy Review Group advising the       Better Regulation Executive from January to December 2010; to give written       and verbal evidence on the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill       (http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmpublic/enterprise/memo/err43.htm       and  http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmpublic/enterprise/120621/am/120621s01.htm);       in Ofwat through membership of Ofwat's Future Regulation Advisory Panel,       and particularly its Customer Engagement subgroup, for which a piece of       work on consumer choice was commissioned which formed the basis of a high       level breakfast briefing at Westminster, and from May 2012 as a non       executive director of Ofwat; and by membership of the Ofgem Retail Market       Review expert panel (S1).
Much of this research was disseminated through       responses to consultation documents, using the framework established       within the ESRC Centre for Competition Policy for identifying such       opportunities where its research findings can contribute to a current       policy area.
Further international policy impact occurred through influencing European       Commission discussions on consumer behaviour in energy markets, where the       research is seen as "very relevant as it has helped us in the         Commission go beyond simply referring to the GB energy market as the         blueprint for electricity and gas market liberalisation...by identifying         issues that need to be addressed even in a market where more than a few         energy providers operate" (S2).
Also, through the Centre on       Regulation in Europe (CERRE), which CCP joined in autumn 2011 and of which       Waddams has been a joint academic director since November 2011.
This group       of regulated industries, regulators and academic institutions is       influential in European policy.
Waddams has been invited by decision       makers to present the work at high level conferences, e.g.
to DG Health       and Consumer Protection, Brussels, 28th November 2008 and the       Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Regulatory Conference, July       2013 (see also S10).
