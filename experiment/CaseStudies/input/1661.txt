     Dr Bayly's research on the development of cultural knowledge and       educational expertise during and after the revolution strongly influenced       Vietnam's Centre for Research and Promotion of the Cultural Heritage         (CCH) and Centre for Research and Preservation of Vietnam's         Doctoral Heritage (CPD) in designing their policies for cultural       heritage preservation, appreciation and education.
CCH (founded 2007) pioneers heritage preservation and public       cultural awareness in Vietnam.
It is affiliated to the Vietnamese       central-government body that accredits cultural organisations and       initiatives, working with international NGOs (including UNESCO) and       Vietnamese public agencies.
Since 2009 CCH has successfully implemented       schemes in Vietnam's most important national museums; it also trains       heritage professionals through capacity-building programmes, and develops       and upgrades heritage sites, equipping them to provide activity-based       education and community outreach.
"In recognition of the value of Dr Bayly's research to our thinking         and planning of our programmes, we appointed her our International         Projects Advisor in 2009, to facilitate our continuing access to her         work to ensure continued input to our programmes from her research."
(Director, CCH)     "Since 2009 our CCH Centre has regularly drawn on Dr Bayly's research         on Vietnamese ideas of cultural knowledge.
Her book and her         presentations ... have greatly aided us in our highly regarded museum         capacity-building programmes. "
(Director, CCH) (a)     Dr Bayly co-coordinated CCH's museum-based educational projects at the Ho       Chi Minh Museum in Hanoi, the Vietnam Women's Museum, and key cultural       heritage institutions including the Presidential Palace in Ho Chi Minh       City.
She has worked as CCH's educational project advisor to the National       Museum of History in Hanoi, the Vietnam Revolution Museum, and the Vietnam       Association of Ethnologists, and regularly advises other public and       private institutions in Vietnam, including the recently-created Vietnam       Centre for the Heritage of National Scientists and Scholars (b).
The idea of making museums and public heritage sites contribute to       development and educational needs is still new in Vietnam; it was       underpinned by Dr Bayly's research findings demonstrating a long tradition       in Vietnam of cultural knowledge as a living national resource: "This         is why her work is so helpful for us in developing our plans for public         knowledge and heritage sites."
(Director, CCH) (a)     "The insights CCH has gained form Br Bayly's research have also helped         us in our initiatives to improve public understandings of the ways         Vietnam's tangible and intangible cultural heritage can be appreciated         in the shaping a vigorous and productive national life."
(Director,       CCH) (a).
In 2012 she participated in an initiative to foster       public understanding of Vietnam's history of Mother Goddess (Dao Mau)       worship as a major repository of artistic and cultural value &#8212; an aspect       of Vietnam's cultural life previously undervalued by citizens and       authorities.
Dr Bayly's research, both on Vietnam and Indian religions,       was critical to this initiative, which resulted in the recognition that       this worship is an expression of spiritual and artistic value which       compares favourably with spiritual traditions in other dynamic Asian       cultures.
(a) In September 2012, this initiative culminated in       an international public outreach congress on the Mother Goddess tradition       (to which Dr Bayly contributed), attended by hundreds of delegates       including community performers and ministry officials.
The event was an       important landmark in developing contemporary public-heritage awareness,       as demonstrated by the intensive media coverage it attracted.
(c)(d)(e)     Another key CCH initiative is motivating the public to address the       challenges of climate change in Vietnam.
Here Dr Bayly's research has       demonstrated the scientific contributions of the country's 20th-century       intellectuals (and the high regard they had for a close harmony of       human-made and environmental forms and features), supporting calls to       action and inspiring the young to contribute.
In 2010-12, Dr Bayly       actively supported CCH's work in making environmental awareness and       climate issues central to hands-on museum-based activities for school-age       visitors at Vietnam's most important museum, the Ho Chi Minh Museum.
CPD (established 2008) is a public foundation fostering public       awareness of Vietnamese scientists' and scholars' work and careers as a       crucial part of Vietnam's living cultural heritage.
It aims to ensure that       the contributions made by modern scientists and scholars to Vietnam and       the world are considered as much a part of Vietnam's cultural heritage as       the old arts and traditions.
Dr Bayly's research on how intellectuals lived and worked in the times of       the national revolution helped CPD exemplify the importance of this aspect       of Vietnam's life &#8212; helping in getting the Centre launched, and initiating       programmes of collecting, preserving and displaying the papers, diaries,       artworks, folk crafts, research equipment, books and official documents.
These collections include relics of Vietnamese scientists' work and life       experiences such as the remarkable instruments and treatment items       developed for battlefield use in Vietnam's liberation wars, not previously       considered valuable items of cultural heritage.
"Her book Asian Voices in a Postcolonial Age has influenced us         very much because it is a study by an international scholar of exactly         the sort of Vietnamese modern cultural life that our Centre works to         preserve and make publicly known throughout our country."
(Director,       CPD).
(f)     CPD's work to raise public awareness of important scientists and their       contribution to Vietnam's cultural heritage has included a landmark       website-based exhibition in 2009; publication of a biography (2009) of       Vietnam's great 20th-century anthropologist, Professor Tu Chi (g);       and a virtual exhibition and memorial volumes on the lives and careers of       five of Vietnam's leading 20th-century medical doctors.
(h)     "With help from Dr Bayly, our CPD Centre is now involved in an         initiative to obtain an expansion of the categories of items and         holdings now covered by our country's legal framework for official         heritage collections, to include personal and private as well as state         holdings and materials."
(Director, CPD).
(f) Within this       initiative, CPD together with Vietnam's National University of Social       Sciences and Humanities staged a major international conference in Hanoi       in December 2012 (with Russian, Korean, Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese       participants) entitled "Managing and strengthening the quality of       community generated archives".
Discussion of how to promote the       public-heritage awareness potential of private, personal and family       archives in Vietnam centred on the paper presented on behalf of CPD,       drawing on Dr Bayly's research on material objects in the lives of modern       intellectuals, on `The heritage scholars' (Bayly, Susan.
2007).
"This         presentation had a great impact on the conference's thinking about the         need for professional archiving...in important forms of public heritage         communication."
