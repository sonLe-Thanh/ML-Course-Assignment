     EAP research into mental capacity has had significant impact on the       conduct of capacity assessments in England and Wales.
This has been       achieved by collaborating with NHS psychiatrists from the outset of the       project, building a network of partners who conduct capacity assessments,       and establishing a workforce training programme and Summer School,       supported by the EAP website and Virtual Learning Environment.
This       training has been particularly effective at communicating the research       results concerning capacity assessments to police officers, social       workers, and health-care practitioners who conduct such assessments.
EAP's collaboration with practitioners began with a group of       psychiatrists in the NHS working on the implementation of the Mental         Capacity Act: Martin began research presentations at Maudsley       Hospital in 2007; both Martin and Freyenhagen were named Honorary       Researchers at the Maudsley in 2010; and from 2010 both Martin and       Freyenhagen have regularly participated in clinical interviews with       patients facing treatment decisions [corroborating source 1].
National       media coverage of EAP research (including the `Today' programme and       `Inside the Ethics Committee' on BBC Radio 4, `The World Today' on BBC       World Service, and The Guardian [corroborating source 2]) helped       the EAP further develop their network of practitioner contacts, bringing       their work to the attention of frontline professionals engaged in capacity       assessment.
Examples include West Midlands Police trainers for the       assessment of mental capacity in police activities, and Brighton and Hove       Council trainers for social workers assessing the capacity of vulnerable       persons.
Over the following months this range of contacts expanded       considerably to include Dr. John Adlam, who works with anorexia inpatients       at the Avalon Ward in London; John Leighton of Cambridgeshire County       Council, who was affiliated with the Social Care Institute of Excellence;       and solicitors and barristers at 39 Essex Street Chambers, who specialise       in mental health law.
Since 2010 this practitioner network has allowed the EAP to build a       training programme for professionals in psychiatry, social work, and       health care on issues pertaining to mental capacity.
The training       programme communicates the main research findings to trainees for       practical application.
This programme includes the Autonomy Summer School,       an annual three-day training course that equips frontline practitioners       with an understanding of the philosophical ideal of autonomy and provides       a forum for the discussion of the dilemmas surrounding its implementation.
The Summer School has been running since 2011 [the inaugural session       covered by The Guardian; see corroborating source 3] and has       attracted over &#163;15,000 in fees in the last two years.
Previously       subsidised by AHRC funding, the Summer School is now a self-funding       project [corroborating source 4].
Feedback shows that trainees were influenced by what they learnt from the       Summer School, and that as a result their practice has been informed by       EAP research.
Over 90% of delegates in 2012 rated the Summer School `very       useful' [corroborating source 4]; using a scale of 1 to 6, delegates'       levels of understanding before and after the training raised by an average       of 2.2 in 2013 [corroborating source 5]; and feedback comments have       included `your expertise is highly valuable to frontline practice', `some       new material presented here that I can integrate into practice' and `very       useful to think about for my practice' [corroborating source 5].
Since 2011 EAP has also offered a series on-site workforce training       modules for health and social care practitioners.
These modules were       developed from the Autonomy Summer School syllabus and address the issues       faced by practitioners who conduct capacity assessments.
EAP workforce       training sessions have included:            January 2012: Herefordshire County Council: Training delivered to 20         social workers and NHS staff covering capacity assessments.
April 2012: University of Essex, a two-day retreat-style workshop on         capacity assessments, bringing together researchers, judges,         psychiatrists and social workers to explore theoretical and practical         challenges associated with capacity assessments.
November 2012: Maudsley Hospital: one day masterclass on capacity         assessment.
December 2012: London Borough of Barnet: training course delivered to         20 social care practitioners covering capacity assessments.
January 2013: Independent Mental Capacity Advocate Study Day: held in         conjunction with Empowerment Matters, a start-up company         offering training to Independent Mental Capacity Advocates.
Attended by         20 IMCAs.

Feedback from these events provides evidence that the training has       changed practice.
The majority of participants stated in exit surveys that       their knowledge on capacity assessments has increased through the       training; 82% of participants from Herefordshire County Council indicated       that the training had been `very useful' [corroborating source 6].
EAP       practitioner training is supported by a Virtual Learning Environment       hosted on the EAP website and made available to delegates of the Summer       School.
The VLE disseminates `Green Paper Reports' on key aspects of       mental capacity assessment.
Within the impact period over 30,000 unique       users have made use of the Essex Autonomy Website and associated Virtual       Learning Environment.
Testimonials from research users also show that trainers in the relevant       professional fields have revised their training materials to incorporate       the insights of Essex research on mental capacity.
We include one example       of this testimonial evidence below:     The Essex Autonomy Project has been really helpful to me in training...
I       train adult `safeguarding leads' in the application of the MCA.
I have       revised the materials to raise questions of procedural/ substantive       autonomy, particularly in relation to vulnerability...The green papers are       of consistently high quality and have been useful resources to help       practitioners understand the concepts behind the MCA.
We have referred       practitioners to the `inherent jurisdiction' green paper to inform       decisions about whether or not a case is suitable for Court     Mental Capacity Act training manager at Cambridgeshire County Council         and MCA development manager at the Social Care Institute of Excellence
