     Based in Eastwood, D.H. Lawrence Heritage is a twin centre visitor       attraction celebrating the life and works of D.H. Lawrence and his links       with coal mining in Nottinghamshire and the broader history of the area;       it has a longstanding relationship with staff in Nottingham's D H Lawrence       Research Centre (DHLRC).
Since his tenure as Director of the DLHRC,       Harrison has reinvigorated this relationship, undertaking sustained public       engagement activity (through exhibitions, talks, outreach) that has       allowed him to share insights and findings from his research, and that of       his colleague John Worthen to stimulate debate and improved understanding       of the area's literary and social heritage.
This engagement extends to       media work (on Lawrence and his locality, but also more recently on a       previously unpublished Lawrence manuscript that Harrison was able to       authenticate on behalf of an archive), allowing Harrison to share the       DHLRC's work more broadly, extending public knowledge on, and insight       into, Lawrence's life, work and legacy.
Providing curatorial leadership and advice on Lawrence and his         locality and contributing to an award-winning visitor experience       Research on Lawrence's relationship to his Nottinghamshire locality (3.1       &amp; 3.3) informs curatorial practice at D. H. Lawrence Heritage (DHLH),       materially influencing the selection of objects and images and the       development of text panels for its exhibitions.
DHLH staff are not       Lawrence specialists.
They rely on input from the DHLRC to ensure that       their material is factually accurate and combines an appropriate level of       specialism and general appeal.
(5.1) The research base offered by the       DHLRC through this curatorial advice adds capacity to this small,       publicly-funded heritage organisation and underpins its ability to       consistently engage core and new audiences: it was given the Best Visitor       Attraction distinction at the Nottinghamshire STARS Awards in 2012.
It       attracted 11,832 visitors between March 2012 and April 2013.
The Leader of       Broxtowe Borough Council cites the partnership as being instrumental in       `ensuring the continuation of D.H. Lawrence Heritage Centre as a visitor       attraction of international importance' and in improving `the D.H.       Lawrence scholar and visitor experience in general' (5.2).
Engaging the public with Lawrence through his locality       Knowledge about and awareness of Lawrence and the wider literary and       cultural heritage of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire has been enhanced       through:            contributions to the annual D. H. Lawrence Festival (21,371 visitors         since 2008): delivering key public lectures (e.g.
Harrison's 2012         lecture on the use of regional locations in Lady Chatterley's Lover);         co-curating the Festival exhibition (e.g.
Harrison's involvement in         curating the 2011 centenary exhibition on The White Peacock).
(5.3)       outreach work informed by Harrison's work on accent and locality (ref         3) with pupils at a local comprehensive school has had `a huge impact on         the students', developing their confidence and feeling of self-worth,         while allowing them to `look directly into Eastwood's past and         heritage'.
(5.4)       exhibitions at the Weston Gallery (part of the University's public         arts centre and museum, whose audiences are predominantly [over 90%]         non-University) have emphasised Lawrence's material connections with         Nottinghamshire and given `a fascinating picture of the literary impact         of Lawrence'.
(5.5) `The Many Lives of DH Lawrence' (4 May-16 September         2012, ref 2), was informed by the research insights of both Harrison and         Worthen (3.1, 3.3 &amp; 3.4), in particular through Harrison's use of         the Clarke papers, and his situating of Worthen's biography in its own         historical context (3.3).
The exhibition attracted 6,360 visitors (from         the UK, Spain, France, Brazil, Canada, USA and Japan), showing a         distinct increase in and diversification of engagement from the         exhibitions staged in 2002, 2005 and 2007 (2967, 2608 and 4213         respectively).
Lakeside's marketing manager attested to the exhibition's         role in helping to `grow the Lakeside audience as well as offering an         insight into academic and significant archival material'.
(5.6) Feedback         from visitors reveals the extent to which the exhibition raised new         awareness of, and interest in, Nottinghamshire's literary and mining         heritage.
(5.5)          Raising public awareness of Lawrence's life and works through         sustained media work       Harrison and Worthen have provided a research knowledge-base for media       work whose role is to generate new understanding and cultural debate.
This       has enhanced the capacity of television producers to produce       `authoritative' content for documentary programming, and through this, has       contributed to changes in public awareness and knowledge at a national and       international level:            Drawing on Worthen's biographical research (3.1) Dr Sean Matthews         (seconded to UNMC from 2010) discussed Lawrence's regional connections         in Teversal on The One Show (9 November 2009, viewer figures 4.91         million); and his links with Middleton-by-Wirksworth on Country Tracks         (26 February 2012); Harrison discussed Lawrence's fictional depiction of         working-class life in Eastwood in a news item to mark the centenary of         Sons and Lovers on the regional news programme BBC East Midlands Today         (29 May 2013).
Harrison and Worthen provided research advice and were interviewed for         a BBC Inside Out programme on Midlands writers and the current         growth in sales of erotic literature (focusing on Lady Chatterley's           Lover as a groundbreaking work in the genre and drawing on themes         in Worthen's published research [3.1]).
The programme aired on 9         September 2013.
Inside Out has around 4 million viewers and         features three items linked by a presenter of approx.
8 and a half         minutes each.
The producer says of the research advice provided by         Worthen and Harrison that their `broad knowledge with very specific         detailed examples allowed me to focus on what was important to include         in the 8 and a half minute item on `DH Lawrence, the explosion in recent         erotic fiction and what would he have thought''.
(5.7)       Harrison has contributed extensively to a forthcoming BBC Culture           Show documentary.
He has used his research on Lawrence in his         locality (3.3) to feed into discussions about the writer's contemporary         importance, has helped to look for ideas and ways in which the story         could be told, and has contributed a central interview to the programme,         providing `an integrity and an authoritative perspective' for the         programme's producer.
(5.8)          Discovery of a new Lawrence Manuscript: stimulating public debate       Staff from the DHLRC regularly work in conjunction with international       archives, interpreting items from their collections and making them       available to diverse audiences.
Evaluation of archival material undertaken       for the Alexander Turnbull Library (ATL) in Wellington, New Zealand       resulted in Harrison's discovery of a new Lawrence manuscript.
The text of       the manuscript was published, with an interpretive essay by Harrison, in       the Times Literary Supplement (29 March 2013); its discovery was       widely reported in the New Zealand and British media (e.g.
in the New         Zealand Herald, 30 March 2013, and in the Guardian and The         Telegraph, 11 April 2013).
(5.9) This exposure served to provide       valuable national and international media exposure for the ATL.
ATL       curator Dr Fiona Oliver noted that: `The significance [of the discovery]       for the Turnbull is it shows our collections have international as well as       national relevance' (5.10).
The discovery also reinvigorated public debate       on Lawrence's attitudes to women, encouraging a re-appraisal of long-held       public misconceptions about this controversial aspect of Lawrence's work       and provoking extensive national and international media and social media       activity: The article was tweeted by individuals and organisations whose       followers total 762,642.
It was then re-tweeted 99 times within two weeks       of publication, and was favourited 52 times.
In addition to broadsheet       media engaging with the story (totalling over 575,000 followers over the Guardian       and Telegraph), the range of individuals and organisations       involved in the twitter activity included women's lifestyle site Jezebel       (@jezebel, 136,000 followers), and a photographer and cultural       commentator (@peepsqueak, 10,302 followers), suggesting that the article       stimulated interest from audiences who might not ordinarily have engaged       with Lawrence and research on Lawrence.
