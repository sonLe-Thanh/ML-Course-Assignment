     Bodies are an issue which recurs constantly in public consciousness,       whenever a new medical technology broaches a long-standing taboo or a new       form of consumption, display, sexuality or death shocks us and challenges       our beliefs.
Such moments make us realize that the body is not the simple,       taken-for-granted object we usually think.
The `Assembling Bodies'       exhibition has encouraged the public to consider how different peoples       have conceptualized the body differently.
The principal impact of this       work has thus been to provoke people to think about bodies in new ways.
The museum exhibition was the `Changing Beliefs of the Human Body'       project's primary avenue for engaging the public.
It was curated by Anita       Herle (Senior Curator, Anthropology - employed at Cambridge since 1991)       and Mark Elliott (Senior Curator, Anthropology - employed at Cambridge       since 2005), in collaboration with the academic team listed in Section 2       above, and was open to the public from March 2009 through November 2010 as       the major temporary exhibition at the Cambridge University Museum of       Archaeology and Anthropology.
With funding from the Leverhulme Trust, Arts       Council East and the Wellcome Trust, it brought together highlights from       the museum's collections and loans from 15 other institutions.
The       exhibition's main thrust was not to overwhelm the visitor didactically in       an academic history of the human body, but rather to provoke the visitor       to question by "offering visitors an opportunity to make sense of the       human enterprise of exploring and representing their material selves" (as       a Nature reviewer put it).
This was done by innovative strategies.
For example, the exhibition juxtaposed objects from very different       contexts.
A Palaeolithic hand-axe and a 1920s prosthetic arm both revealed       ways of extending the body.
A DNA genotype and a medieval genealogy of       Jesus exemplified different ways of relating bodies.
A particularly       effective strategy was the use of modern art, much of it original       creations, to engage the visitor's own body tactilely (as in Bonnie       Kemske's `ceramic hugs') and to make them think about how we see the body       (as in Jim Bond's `anamorphic man' sculpture).
As Anthropology Today       commented, "It is striking how the curators of `Assembling Bodies'       have pulled together such a cohesive argument from so many time periods,       disciplinary standpoints and conceptual trajectories."
The exhibition was viewed by approximately 117,700 museum visitors, a       notable increase in visitor numbers over the Museum's average for       preceding years.
During this time, 76 outreach events were held.
These       ranged from gallery talks by curators to tours for museum professionals to       standing-room-only children's events at science festivals (including       "sleep-overs in the Museum" on 15 May 2009 and 26 March 2010).
This was a       national and international audience, with 38% of visitors from areas of       the UK outside the Cambridge area and 22% from overseas.
The exhibition       was also made available to the public via a website, which additionally       included downloadable research packs for school use.
Between March 2009       and November 2010, 1624 unique visitors accessed the website (6873 page       views in total).
Several lines of evidence reveal the exhibition's significance.
Reviews       commended its creativity, accessibility and high impact.
The exhibition       was evaluated professionally using multiple techniques, including       thermal-imaging observation of visitor-movement patterns (n=131), visitor       questionnaires (n=663), in-depth exit interviews (n=25) and focus group       discussions.
Visitors included substantially more young people than other       exhibitions (41% under 17, 17% 18-24).
The key points to emerge from these       evaluations were:            Most visitors spent a considerable time at the exhibition: thermal         monitoring showed that they spent on average more than twice as long         viewing this exhibition as they did the Museum's previous temporary         exhibition; attended to a wide range of the displays; and had a         "high-quality" visit according to museum evaluation standards.
Visitors particularly found themselves provoked to think by the         original creative artworks and the interactive displays.
For example, a         typical visitor comment was "as a doctor, [I found] plenty to learn and         reflect upon".
They also left with vivid impressions of ethnographic and         historical elements tied to the academic research behind the project         such as modern shaman's costumes, medieval genealogies and Mesolithic         deer-skull masks.
For Anglia Ruskin University students, "visiting the `Assembling           Bodies' exhibition was, based on the responses to our module         evaluation questionnaires, one of the highlights of three of the main         contextual and theoretical studies modules for BA Illustration and BA         Illustration &amp; Animation students" (Contact 1).
Qualitatively, in free-text visitor comments, visitors overwhelmingly         (90%) emphasized that they had learned new things and been provoked to         see the body in a different way by their visit to the exhibition.
For         example, Anglia Ruskin University English students incorporated a visit         to the exhibition into their first-year teaching of imaginative writing         - an unexpected use which suggests how much the exhibition provoked         complex reactions (Contact 2).
The exhibition's offshoots also illustrate its wider reach and       significance.
For example, it inspired art students at the Cambridge       Regional College to create `Bodies Exposed', an exhibition of       photographs of bodies highlighting their own insights into bodies and body       image.
To quote one of the student photographers, "I had never been to the       Museum before, and I didn't even know what Anthropology meant, so this has       really [opened my eyes] to the different yet similar ways people can       represent themselves."
A popular and compelling element of the exhibition,       the autobiographical `body maps' drawn by South African women suffering       from HIV, inspired creative artists Rachel Gadsden, Nondumiso Hlwele and       the Bambanani Women's Group from Khayelitsha Township, Cape Town, South       Africa to collaborate with the MAA in developing a further exhibition, `Unlimited         Global Alchemy'; this was exhibited to very positive reviews in the       Museum as part of the 2012 London Cultural Olympiad and has subsequently       transferred to Pretoria, South Africa with equal success.
