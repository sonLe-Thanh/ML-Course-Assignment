     Impacts on Health and Welfare     The ScHARR research report on statins was submitted to NICE in 2005 and       provided the key evidence which shaped new national guidance on statin       therapy for England and Wales, Statins for the prevention of         cardiovascular events.
Technology Appraisal 96.
(January 1996) [S1].
The guidance resulted in an increase in the number of people benefitting       from statin prescribing.
Previously statins had been prescribed to people       with a history of a CVD event (secondary prevention), but the guidance led       to statin prescribing to include "healthy" populations at high risk of       future events (primary prevention) [S2], subsequently to diabetics [S3]       and to individuals at high genetic risk of coronary disease [S4].
The guidance resulted in an additional 3.3 million people in England and       Wales becoming eligible for statin treatment.
[S2] In 2006 Professor David       Barnett, Chair of the independent NICE Appraisal Committee that developed       the TA94 guidance, predicted that "In terms of potential impact this       guidance is arguably one of the most significant to have come out of NICE       since it started over six years ago."
The volume of statin prescriptions in England has increased year on year       since the guidance was issued in 2006, up by 44% between 2005 and 2008       (from 33,772,000 to 48,717,000) and up by 70% (to 57,454,000) between 2005       and 2011 (the latest year for which prescription data are available).
[S5]       The Health Survey for England (HSE) 2006 reported that use of statins and       other lipid-lowering drugs was 73% in men and 65% in women with       self-reported doctor diagnosed ischaemic heart disease (IHD) or stroke.
[S5] This had increased to 79% of men and 72% of women over 35 with       self-reported doctor-diagnosed IHD or stroke, based on the HSE 2011.
[S6]     Cardiovascular related mortality rates per 100,000 have reduced from       approximately 310 for males (approximately 180 for females) in 2004 to       approximately 250 for males (approximately 120 for females) in 2009.
[S8]       Treatment with lipid lowering drugs, particularly statins, enables       effective reduction in LDL, and, therefore, total cholesterol levels, with       resulting reductions in CVD incidence and deaths, and overall       mortality.
[S6] A gradual decrease in mean total cholesterol levels in both       sexes between 2006 and 2011 [S6] has occurred.
Mean total cholesterol       levels have reduced by 4% (from 5.2 and 5.0 mmol/l) in men and by 6% (from       5.4 and 5.1 mmol/l) in women between 2008 and 2011.
[S6] Every 1% fall in       mean population total cholesterol levels decreases CVD mortality by       approximately 2.5%.
[S7]     Economic impact     Our research was the first research study to compare directly the five       statins available to the NHS in 2004 within the same systematic review and       economic model.
The systematic review concluded that evidence from the       placebo-controlled trials did not indicate any difference between the       clinical efficacy of atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin and       simvastatin.
The NICE guidance on statins, informed by this research, was,       therefore, able to recommend that "when the decision has been made to         prescribe a statin, the therapy should usually be initiated with a drug         with a low acquisition cost (taking into account required daily dose and         product price per dose)."
[S1] A shift to prescribing the low cost       statin, simvastatin, has been seen in prescribing patterns since the       introduction of the guidance in 2006.
[S9] Nationally, lower cost statins       have increased as a percentage of total statin prescriptions.
The impact       of this has been to reduce the cost of statin prescribing per patient in       the NHS.
The NAO reported savings of &#163;323 million achieved by cost       effective prescribing of statins in 2009 (relative to a 2005 baseline).
[S9]     CVD cost the health care system in the UK around &#163;8.6 billion in 2009.
[S10] The cost of hospital care for people who have CVD accounts for 50%       of these costs.
[S10] Treating people with statins leads to large savings       in hospitalisation costs for all vascular events amongst a wide range of       high risk individuals.
[S11].
For example, statins prescribing has       contributed to a fall in the incidence of hospitalised acute myocardial       infarction between 2008 and 2010 from 98 to 86 per 100,000 for men and       from 138 to 133 per 100,000 for women.
