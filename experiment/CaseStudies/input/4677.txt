     Context       One of the four main objectives of the FSA was to promote public       understanding of the financial system.
In 2003, the FSA launched a new       initiative to develop and implement a national strategy for financial       capability.
This included the establishment of a Financial Capability       Steering Group, which identified seven priorities to be explored by a       series of specially convened working groups.
In the 2004 progress report,       the FSA stated that it would commission a comprehensive baseline survey to       establish the current state of financial capability in the UK, which would       also be used to inform the evaluation of individual pilot projects set up       within the strategy.
Nature of the impact       In designing and analysing the financial capability baseline survey, PFRC       has made a significant contribution to national policy.
The baseline       survey was used by the FSA to "inform its priorities for the national       strategy and its wider regulatory work to help retail consumers achieve a       fair deal [a, pg 52].
The FSA's strategy covered the period 2006-11 and       was worth &#163;90 million [a, pg 51].
The strategy was deemed successful: it       exceeded its target of reaching 10 million people and changed the way       policy-makers think about financial capability and its role in UK society       [d, pg 8].
Based on the baseline survey findings, the FSA targeted interventions and       consumer communications at specific demographic or socio-economic groups       [e, pg 12]:            The survey showed that young adults are the least financially capable,         yet they face great financial responsibilities.
In response, the FSA         delivered Learning Money Matters [e, pg 6], where between         2006 and 2011 free advice, support and resources was offered to schools         and teachers.
The program successfully reached over 2 million young         people in 4,259 schools [f].
Evaluation of Learning Money Matters         found that personal finance education had a positive impact on students'         attitudes to saving and borrowing and their confidence in dealing with         money [g].
Economic wellbeing and financial capability were incorporated into         Personal Social Health &amp; Economic (PSHE) education.
Though PSHE         remains outside the national curriculum (non- statutory), the Department         for Educations provides guidance and end of key stage statements         specific to financial capability for key stage 3 and 4 as part of the         Secondary National Curriculum [h].
The guidance for teaching financial         capability in the secondary curriculum for key stage 3 and 4 refers to         output 2 to help define what the guidelines are trying to achieve [i,         pg.
4].
The Money Doctors scheme focused on young people in higher         education.
Two-thirds of students (65%) said they had taken action to         improve their financial situation or planned to do so as a result of         attending a face-to-face Money Doctor's financial advice session         [j].
New parents were also targeted through the Parents Guide to Money.
Early evaluation showed that two-thirds of new parents had taken action         to make a positive change to their financial situation within three         months of receiving the Guide.
[k].
As part of its strategy to address the financial capability deficits         identified in the baseline survey, the FSA set up a &#163;12 million Money           Guidance Pathfinder to deliver financial guidance to the UK public         on a range of personal finance issues.
Over 220,000 people were helped         by the Pathfinder in a 12 month period.
Evaluation of the Pathfinder         found that nearly three quarters of users took action to improve their         financial situation after using the service [l].
The service was         subsequently rolled out nationally through the Money Advice Service         (used by 1.3 million people in 2011/12 alone [m]).
Reach of the impact       The methodology developed by PFRC to measure financial capability has       since been adopted by other countries.
The Financial Regulator of Ireland       commissioned the PFRC to carry out qualitative research to adapt the UK       survey to the Irish context prior to a national survey of financial       capability in Ireland [b].
Canada [n], Australia [o, pg 12] and the       Netherlands [o, pg 12] have also used and adapted the UK approach.
The       approach has also been adapted for use in the emerging area of public       legal education, to conceptualise domains of legal capability and thus       provide a framework for the future delivery and evaluation of public legal       education [c].
Kempson has conducted work for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation       and Development on the survey measurement of financial capability, with       the aim of establishing robust and comparable international data [4].
The World Bank selected and used the empirical approach developed by PFRC       in a substantial research and evaluation programme in low and middle       income countries in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia       Pacific regions [p].
Collard and Kempson were advisers to the World Bank       on this project, and Kempson was lead author of the final programme report       [p].
The World Bank programme furthered the conceptualisation of financial       capability by incorporating psychological traits into the measure       financial capability; provided much-needed evidence on the effectiveness       of different financial education initiatives; and produced a Toolkit for       the evaluation of financial education to help improve the evidence base.
