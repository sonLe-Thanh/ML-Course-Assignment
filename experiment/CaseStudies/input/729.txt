     The work satisfies two of examples of impact suggested by Panel A.       Firstly under the general category `Impact on public policy and         services' the research has been widely quoted.
As one of many       examples the Benton and Parker (R3) study was used in by the European         Food Information Council (C1) to support the view that "Breakfast         breaks the overnight fast and provides energy to kick-start the body and         sharpen the mind".
Of the nine papers quoted, Swansea work published       in 1998 was the oldest, with the next oldest paper dated 2005.
Similarly       the US Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service, when       they recommended a School Breakfast Program (C2), quoted Swansea research       to support the view that "Children who eat breakfast are more likely to         behave better in school and get along with their peers than those who do         not".
Although a general benefit of breakfast has been more widely studied, the       more specific contribution of the Swansea research (R4, R5) has been to       recommend consuming a low glycaemic meal (releases energy slowly).
The UK       School Food Trust, that advised schools on the meals they provided,       offered the view that "Foods with a lower Glycaemic Index (GI) ....         have been shown to sustain attention and time spent on task when doing         class work, as well as reducing frustration" (C3) quoting only       Swansea research (R5) as justification for this advice.
In 2010 the impact       of the Swansea research was acknowledged by the Education Committee of         the House of Commons when they considered Behaviour and Discipline       in Schools (C4).
It was noted that there is good evidence that eating       breakfast is beneficial to the performance and behaviour of school       children, a view "reinforced by ...
Professor David Benton ... who had         conducted research which found that eating breakfast improved the         cognitive performance of some children...".
The second type of impact falls under the heading `Impacts on         commerce'.
More specifically "Industry (including overseas         industry) has invested in research and development": indeed the       research is characterized by the level of industrial funding it has       attracted.
As it offered a theoretical underpinning to the development of       novel food items, over the 1993 to 2012 period funding was attracted on eleven         occasions from multi-national, food and ingredient manufacturers       based in France, Germany, Netherlands, Japan, USA as well as the         United Kingdom: both during the stage when the ideas were developed       [text removed for publication] and during the REF period when this       information was exploited [text removed for publication].
Often       industrial funding since 1993, but prior to the REF, resulted in impact       during the REF period (see Danone / Kraft example below).
The research has been, and continues to be, of great interest to both       ingredient and food manufacturers, as by varying the nutritional profile       of products they can potentially make claims about mood and cognitive       functioning, with the consequence that a premium can be charged for novel       products.
This widespread interest reflected both the decision to draw       attention to the findings by speaking at commercially orientated meetings       and the fact that commercial organizations had read academic reports of       the work.
By their nature commercial organizations need to be aware of       research throughout the world and can choose to fund work where ever they       wish.
Without exception the offers of research funding were unsolicited -       contact was always initiated by the company.
During the period the nature       of the questions asked varied and included the consideration of particular       products such as breakfast cereals, biscuits, milk products and energy       drinks and ingredients such as milk, cereals and different sugars.
The       work has considered children and both younger and older adults.
The funding from [text removed for publication] reflected their prior       knowledge of Swansea research that found varying the glycaemic load of       breakfast improved children's memory and increased the time spent on       school tasks (R5).
They wished to explore whether one of their products       had a similar influence: this was a scientifically attractive proposition       as for the first time it allowed the glycaemic response to a meal to be       distinguished from the macro-nutrient composition.
Based on these findings       a patent was established that claimed that isomaltulose can be used       to enhance mental performance in the postprandial phase (C5).
The evidence       quoted in the patent application was previous work from Swansea (R4) and a       summary of their funded research, carried out in Swansea, that found in       schools that both the mood and memory of children were better in the late       morning after consuming an isomaltulose rather than glucose-based meal.
[text removed for publication] has twice funded research based on       prior Swansea research (R4), with the aim of developing a product that       slowly releases glucose and hence facilitates mood and memory.
The final       report was delivered in 2011 and there are plans to launch a product,       based on the findings, although the time-scale is uncertain and relies on       the development of items that are acceptable to the consumer [text         removed for publication].
An example of industrial funding prior to the REF, resulting in impact       during the REF, is offered by the funding of Danone, France       that resulted in the first report of cognition being facilitated by a       product that slowly releases glucose (R4).
The product, Petit D&#233;jeurner       Lu, was subsequently sold to Kraft and now retails under the trade name       Belvita.
The biscuit is sold in the USA, Australia, Belgium, Czech       Republic, France, Portugal, Hungary, Poland, the United Kingdom and       Brazil.
In 2013, in the UK alone, the biscuit achieved &#163;50m year-on-year       sales, having grown 60 per cent over the previous year (C6).
It is said to       have "revolutionised the biscuit category" by establishing a new       section of the market.
It is clear from the advertising that Swansea       research plays a key role in the positioning of the product: it is claimed       that the biscuit benefits mood and cognition in the late morning.
In fact       Swansea research is consistently mentioned when advertising the product;       often it is the only supporting evidence quoted.
The current French       website for `Belvita Petit D&#233;jeuner', a breakfast biscuit, states: "The         breakfast has a beneficial effect on cognitive functioning.
Studies         have shown that people who eat breakfast score higher on memory tests         than those who did not" (C7: translated from French).
Only two       studies are listed (R3, R4) to support this assertion, both carried out in       Swansea.
The latter (R4), the first study to report a positive response to       a low-glycaemic meal, had been funded by Danone.
Of many international       examples, the Australian website for Belvita has a video of a       nutritionist stating that the product results in "better concentration and       memory throughout the morning" and the Polish advertisement for Belvita       lists Swansea findings (C8).
In 2012 [text removed for publication]       provided funds to evaluate the association between individual differences       in the ability to control blood glucose and cognition.
The aim was more       basic; to explore novel means of monitoring the response to food so in the       future the glucose profile produced could be used to predict cognitive       outcomes.
The principles developed, as opposed to specific results with a product,       have also had a wide impact.
In 2013 alone Benton was asked by firms [text         removed for publication] to address new products meetings by       examining the possibility of using these ideas to develop novel food       items.
There are a number of other instances where the ideas developed in       Swansea have provided the underpinning research quoted in product       information, although the product as such had not been studied.
For       example Dutch Lady Milk is the market leader for follow-on       formulae in Malaysia: in their advertisements they quote only       Swansea research, emphasising the small reserves of glucose in the brains       of children (C9).
In 2012 [text removed for publication] funded a       study that used the ideas of this case study (C10) by examining the impact       of a low glycaemic index milk- powder on the behaviour and cognition of       young children.
As the decision to launch a product is complex and multi-facetted, it       would be na&#239;ve to expect that any line of research, by itself, was       decisive.
The case being made is that the present research has played a       role critical in this complex process: that is with an increasing number       of firms, on four continents, there is evidence that "Industry         (including overseas industry) has invested in research and development"       and have used Swansea research to promote their products.
