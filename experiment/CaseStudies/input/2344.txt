     Public Safety     Saving lives from natural disasters is a priority and drives CURBE's       research both nationally and internationally.
The Foresight report       entitled "Reducing Risks of Future Disasters: Priorities for Decision       Makers" included a work package co-authored by CURBE members (Tompkins et       al., 2012).
The initiative was launched by the Government Office for       Science in the UK (December 2012), and in it, Professor Sir John       Beddington says,     "...The good news is that science has the potential to play an         increasingly important role in [Disaster Risk Reduction] DRR.
Science         tells us why disasters happen and where many of the risks lie, and for         some disasters we can even forecast when they will occur."
Internationally, through 15 years of research in assessing earthquake       damage and vulnerability studies, CURBE is an authority in earthquake loss       estimation models.
The application of loss modelling for governments and       international development agencies is relatively new; CURBE's work is an       integral part of GEM, the Global Earthquake Model.
GEM is a public-private partnership to develop new open-access tools for       earthquake loss modelling, suitable for use at a national, city and       community level.
Launched in 2009, it is the largest earthquake research       programme in operation globally today and its strategy for risk assessment       has been informed from the start by participation of CURBE in developing       the methods for the underlying risk components.
Dr So is working with CAR       to develop the GEM Earthquake Consequences Database[G].
".. through the efforts of Prof Robin Spence and Dr Emily So ... our         community now has at its disposal not only an open transparent         repository of data and information on the impacts of tens of major past         earthquakes around the world, but also a set of tools and standards that         may be used in the years to come..."     Secretary General, GEM[A]     Humanitarian Response     Leading the field of global practitioners in mass-casualty assessment       after earthquakes, So is part of the team developing the U.S. Geological       Survey's Prompt Assessment for Global Earthquakes Response (PAGER)         [F] programme.
PAGER provides an alert less than 30 minutes after       an event has occurred, based on an estimate of the number of deaths or       extent of economic losses due to ground shaking following an earthquake.
Funded by USAID, these prompt alerts inform the White House and FEMA as       well as UN agencies on likely impacts of earthquakes around the world.
Alerted of the likely severity of the event, the precious few hours       immediately after the Haiti earthquake in 2010 were used by the Office of       U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to mobilise monetary and physical       aid, well before the Haitian government requested help:       "This work continues to be critical as our response actions integrate         the very rapid assessment and alert levels provide by PAGER...
This         results in our ability to expedite assistance and potential save lives..."     Senior Physical Scientist, FEMA Region VIII, Mitigation Division[B]     The innovative use of post-event damage mapping using remote sensing has       been used by agencies to direct post disaster decisions.
The techniques       developed by Saito were used to assess the total damage and cost in Haiti       and guided the World Bank in raising the required funding for loans (Saito       et al., 2011).
Ultimately the Haitian people benefited through the aid       provided for reconstruction.
Mapping techniques acquired through CURBE       projects were used to directly assist the British Red Cross and UN Habitat       with their recovery efforts in Haiti:       "Cambridge research work was critical in terms of advocacy and advice         to the Government of Haiti and resulted directly in the decision by the         Prime Minister's Secretariat to recognise the area as a new permanent         settlement and a political priority"     Senior Technical Advisor, UN Habitat Haiti[D]     Commercial impact     The insurance industry relies on catastrophe loss estimation models to       estimate potential financial losses to its assets at risk, and to properly       price the risks.
Insurance companies like ACC for Wellington in New       Zealand (Cousins et al.
2008) directly benefit as they are able to expand       their market with more accurate risk pricing, and ultimately the       purchasers of insurance are able to offset their risks, and get payments       for rebuilding in the event of an earthquake.
"In the domain of catastrophe risk, loss estimation and the impact of         that research on society in general and insurance/reinsurance industry         in particular, your work has been very prominent and well used as well         as well referenced by the governments, academic researchers and the         insurance industry.
...If I have to mention few teams around the world         who have made major contributions in this field, Cambridge team and the         two of you will always be featured in the top three...."     Founder &amp; Senior Advisor, RMS, Inc.[E]     Spence worked with Willis Re to develop the risk model which underpins       the Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool through which two million       previously uninsured households are today insured against earthquake       damage.
As part of the Willis Research Network, CURBE continues to engage       with users to focus research on applications and reducing risk through       different media[C].
