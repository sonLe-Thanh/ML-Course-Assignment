     In the late 1990s, cataracts became widespread in farmed Atlantic salmon       in Ireland, Norway and Scotland.
This was correlated with the removal of       blood meal from salmon feed due to the potential health risk of       contamination by scrapie and related prion proteins.
The economic impact       of these outbreaks was modelled and indicated the severity of the problem:     "The annual direct costs of cataracts [to the Norwegian farmed salmon         industry] was estimated to be &#8364;27.9 million"     (Corroborative Source A).
To put this in perspective, this was costlier than the most important       diseases of swine and poultry within the UK at the time (ca.
&#8364;20.4       million) and was a major cause of concern for the EU fishing industry.
Sanderson was approached to find a solution to this problem and her       research fulfilled this objective.
The work identified histidine and its       metabolite N-acetyl histidine as essential for salmon lens       physiology.
In addition, it provided a mechanistic understanding by       defining the role of N-acetyl histidine in salmon lens       osmoregulation and strongly suggested that histidine deficiency was       responsible for the cataract outbreaks observed in farmed Atlantic salmon.
These results were immediately applied in the field and confirmed by       feeding trials with control groups compared to salmon fed with       supplemented histidine (reference 2 above).
The results of the research were rapidly disseminated and led to changes       in salmon feeding practice within the EU fishing industry with an       immediate economic benefit.
Due to the dietary intervention, cataract       formation in EU farmed salmon has been virtually eradicated with an annual       economic impact of millions of pounds.
As stated by the Global Research       Manager at Marine Harvest, the largest supplier of farmed salmon       with worldwide fishery sites, and accounting for 20% of global production:     "The research demonstrated the causal role of a deficiency in dietary         histidine in cataract formation.
Cataract in farmed salmon presented a         considerable problem to the aquaculture industry, resulting in severe         financial losses.
Since increasing dietary histidine levels, further         outbreaks of severe cataract has rarely been observed, presenting a         consequent saving to the salmon farming industry.
This research has         therefore had a significant global impact on a multi-billion dollar         industry.''

A Senior Research Fellow at the Section for Epidemiology and       Biostatistics, Norwegian School of Veterinary Science, who modelled the       economic cost of cataract formation says     "As of today, cataract incidents in farmed salmon are rare and the         disease does no longer present a significant economic impact on the         salmon farming industry.
The EU concerted action, and the UEA research         group to which Dr Sanderson belonged, thus played a key role to identify         the main causative factor and to remedy the cataract problem in Atlantic         salmon farming."

Subsequently, Sanderson's research has had reach and significance beyond       the EU community and created a global awareness of the importance of       dietary histidine in farmed salmon.
In their report on the nutrient       requirements of fish and shrimp, the American National Research Council of       the National Academies discusses the beneficial effects of histidine in       reducing cataract formation in farmed salmon and cites Sanderson's       references 2 and 3 above (Corroborative Source D).
Similarly, the       United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) highlights cataract       formation as a deficiency disease in salmon farming, citing Sanderson's       reference 2 from above:     "In Atlantic salmon, cataracts develop in certain genetic strains         during the smoltification and post-smoltification periods.
Several         dietary factors are implicated in the pathogenesis, including histidine         deficiency...."     (Corroborative Source E).
The Japanese company Kyowa Hakko Bio, a major producer of amino       acids by fermentation or by chemical synthesis, asked for authorisation to       include its commercial L-histidine monochloride as a supplement in salmon       feed.
This was considered by the European Food Safety Authority and the       product was approved for use in aquaculture (Corroborative Source F).
Currently, producers of salmon feed have modified their formulations to       incorporate sufficient histidine content, particularly during the "at       risk" period identified by Sanderson (reference 3 above).
For example,       Skretting, the world's largest supplier of farmed fish feed, state for       their salmon smolt feeds, "Formulated to meet a minimum level of histidine       at critical times of year to help prevent cataract" (Corroborative Source       G).
