     The major impacts of the work can be summarised:     International guidelines for the management of cryptococcal         meningitis:     The results of the research outlined above have been central to the       development of the Infectious       Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for management of       Cryptococcal meningitis (2010)       [A], the "WHO Rapid Advice: Diagnosis, prevention, and management of         cryptococcal disease in         HIV-infected adults, adolescents, and children" published in 2011       [B], and the Southern African       guidelines published in 2007 [C] and updated in 2013 [D].
Specifically,       these guidelines endorse       findings from the underpinning research outlined above, and advise:            Superiority of amphotericin B over fluconazole &#8212; and preference for         use of amphotericin B         wherever it is possible to use it safely.
Addition of flucytosine (when available) to amphotericin B supported         by demonstration of the         added fungicidal activity resulting from the combination.
High dose amphotericin B based on superior sterilizing activity.
At least 1200 mg/d as the preferred initial fluconazole dose, and high         dose fluconazole plus         flucytosine as preferred oral treatment option.
Adoption of a short, one week, course of amphotericin B where         resources do not allow safe,         sustainable use of standard 2 weeks courses.
Mortality:     The impact of adopting these recommendations in resource-limited       settings, which previously used       ineffective fluconazole monotherapy, is a reduction in the the 10-week       mortality from over 50% to       25-35% when amphoteracin B based treatments are used (see Research       References 1 &amp; 4       above).
This is achieved through wider use of standard amphotericin B       induction, and of effective       but also affordable and sustainable alternatives (short course       amphotericin B, and combination oral       therapy with high dose fluconazole).
Economic benefits:     The cost comparisons, lobbying and advocacy initiated by the study team       [E,F] caused the       pharmaceutical company Bristol Myers Squibb to reduce the price of       amphotericin B in South       Africa by 80% (146 to 26 ZAR/50mg vial).
This has resulted in the use of       amphotericin B (as       opposed to fluconazole) for induction therapy being increased from an       estimated 34% of patients in       2005 to 83% in 2010 [F,G].
Based on the work of the group, and in line       with the international       guidelines, an increasing number of Sub-Saharan Africa countries have       adopted 1200 mg/d as the       standard fluconazole dose, with the effect that this dose is now routinely       used in initial therapy       throughout those countries [H].
Adoption of the screen and pre-emptive treatment strategy after HIV         diagnosis.
Following the evidence produced by the St George's group The Department       of Health in South       Africa has agreed to a phased implementation of the introduction of a       screen and pre-emptive       treatment strategy for cryptococcal meningitis in newly diagnosed HIV       patients.
In many African       centres this now represents over half of all cases.
This was incorporated       into the 2012 Department       of Health strategic plan [I] following meetings in Pretoria in February       2011 with CDC, PEPFAR       representatives and Harrison.
Of note is that a cost-effectiveness       analysis demonstrated that       screening has become the optimal standard of care &#8212; i.e.
it both saves       lives and saves money       (through a reduction in costs associated with caring for patients) [J].
Screening is now in routine       use in South Africa's Western Cape and Gauteng provinces; further projects       based on this strategy       are being implemented in Uganda, Kenya, Zambia, and Tanzania.
Screening,       using the new point-of-care       diagnostic test, was endorsed by the 2011 WHO guidelines for areas of high       prevalence [B]       and recommended in the updated 2013 Southern African Clinicians Society       guidelines [D].
Effective screening with subsequent treatment substantially reduces the       number of cases of       cryptococcal meningitis presenting after a diagnosis of HIV has been made       and anti-retroviral       therapy started, demonstrating the extensive reach and significance of       this research.
