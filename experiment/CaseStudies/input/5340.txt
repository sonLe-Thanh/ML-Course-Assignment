     Impacts include: health and welfare, public policy and services,       commercial       Main beneficiaries include: patients, NICE, European Society of       Cardiology, industry     Until 2001, the only treatment available for PAH was intravenous       epoprostanol, an expensive (&#163;&gt;80K per patient, per annum) drug with an       extremely short half-life, given directly into the pulmonary circulation.
Bosentan, an endothelin antagonist, was the first orally active drug       approved for PAH (costing &#163;30K per patient per annum).
Sildenafil, which       works by a different mechanism, was the second; originally licensed for       erectile dysfunction (as Viagra&#174;).
Professor Wilkins and his team at       Imperial explored its off label use in PAH from bench-to-bedside and       collated a persuasive data set that argued its efficacy, and so offering a       cheaper alternative (&#163;9k per patient per annum).
Sildenafil was approved       for PAH internationally in 2006.
Pfizer launched the drug as Revatio&#174; to       distinguish it from Viagra&#174; but it is the same drug.
Sildenafil was       adopted and recommended as a first line treatment for PAH by international       societies (British Thoracic Society [2008], European Cardiac       Society/European Respiratory Society [2009]) [1, 2].
Subsequent       meta-analyses which cite the Wilkins study (among others since then)       confirm the efficacy of Sildenafil in PAH [3].
Sildenafil is now the most commonly prescribed drug for PAH and it is the       most cost-effective, as judged by a technology appraisal initiated by NICE       [4].
Equally important, it is available, as Viagra&#174;, and affordable in the       developing world.
Worldwide sales of sildenafil (Revatio&#174;) for the       management of PAH were $500m in 2010, up from $95m in 2006, $201m in 2007       and $336m in 2008 [5].
Revatio&#174; was the first drug with this mode of       action to be approved worldwide for patients with PAH.
In 2013, the Pfizer       patent expired leading to reports that the cost of the drug will fall       further as new generic drugs enter the market making the treatment       significantly more cost effective [6].
