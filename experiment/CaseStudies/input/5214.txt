     The research described above played an important role in the       establishment and curation of the Museum of London Docklands' London,       Sugar and Slavery gallery.
LSS is a key component of MoLD, the world's       largest urban history museum, attracting, on average, 100,000-180,000       visitors per annum in 2008 to 2011 [1].
As its external academic curator,       Bressey has played a key role in the development of the gallery since it       was first proposed to commemorate the bicentenary in 2007 of the abolition       of the British transatlantic slave trade.
The only permanent gallery on       slavery in a London museum, its impact has continued throughout the REF       census period.
One of MoLD's objectives in setting up the gallery was to develop an       innovative strategy of engagement with communities, including       Afro-Caribbeans, who feared the bicentenary would be 'whitewashed' into a       celebration of the abolitionist movement rather than exploring the       experience of black people in London.
Bressey took particular       responsibility for the gallery's `Legacy Section', which draws heavily on       her work on Black Victorians [b, c].
Her research on the continuous black       presence in London, including on using visual materials to develop diverse       narratives [d], was instrumental in creating a space in which a continuous       history to the present day could be explored, thus enabling the museum to       fulfil its goal of developing a historical narrative in partnership with       the communities most closely involved [10].
By utilising Bressey's       research, the museum was able to convey a more complex story about the       history of slavery than the usual narrative of victimhood and rescue, and       to create the gallery as a co-production with local communities [10], with       space for a continued public participation in the histories displayed.
The gallery launched with a two-day open event in November 2007 with over       3,000 people in attendance; for many, the launch represented their first       visit to the museum [2].
As such, the opening of LSS had an immediate       impact in terms of engaging new museum audiences and, more       specifically, attracting new audiences from black and minority ethnic         groups, who made up 44.7% of those attending the opening event [2].
The museum's diversity manager at the time stated that community       involvement in the gallery's development attracted new black audiences       from impoverished areas, and sparked debates among this demographic about       the narratives of slavery and the presentation of the historical and       contemporary black experience in London [3].
It also had &#8212; and continues       to have &#8212; a beneficial impact on MoLD's visitor numbers.
Between       January and April 2008 these showed a 35% increase relative to the same       period in 2006; numbers for 2010-2011 were even better, with 178,925       museum visitors, 50,000 more than in 2009-2010 [1].
These higher numbers       of people coming into contact with the gallery content have significantly       enhanced its capacity to illustrate that this history of slavery is the       story of all Londoners.
The impacts of Bressey's research contribution on the quality of         visitor experiences and level of their engagement with the         gallery content are also apparent in the 937 gallery comments       reviewed from 2008 to 2012.
Visitors' close engagement with the gallery       material is evident in the references in these comments to themes of       personal connection, links, emotion and humanity, with many of them       identifying strong bonds between the gallery material and visitors' own       lives.
These themes are to be found in 264 (28 per cent) of comments       reviewed and are thus representative of a substantial amount of gallery       responses [4].
The reach of the gallery's impacts on public awareness of,       and engagement with, core themes in Bressey's work has, moreover, been extended         through LSS' coverage in many local, regional, national and         international media outlets including: `Voices from the past' (16       January 2008).
BBC Homes &amp; Antiques Magazine (circulation       100,886); You and Yours (January 2008).
BBC Radio 4; `London's not       too sweet' (25 January 2008).
The Chronicle, local paper       (circulation 41,157); and `A story of slavery' (15 January 2008).
Limited         Edition, local paper (circulation 22,195) [4].
LSS includes a permanent space for community groups or collectives to       produce exhibitions that respond to the gallery in any way they choose.
These exhibitions are displayed on six-month cycles, with each cycle       curated by a different community group or collective as a means of       allowing new voices to enter the gallery and engage with the research.
The       space actively facilitates community engagement with cultural and         artistic heritage, including among traditionally hard-to-reach         demographics.
Thus, for example, the Journeys and Kinship project,       which ran from February to November 2012, involved four members of museum       staff and around 26 young participants, predominantly black males aged       13-26 and from a mix of London areas.
As part of the project, the young       people worked with research material in the gallery to create a range of       creative outputs, including music recordings and clay masks [4].
Reporting       on the process, two of the project facilitators noted that it changed the       young participants' understanding of the past: "One of the things that the       young people [...] talked about," one reported, "is now that they've seen       the past, they can see where they are now and also what do they want to       change" [4].
The truth of this impression was supported by discussion with       a project participant about sharing project content with others: "If I       don't show a youth it doesn't feel like I've done anything with it because       you're only as good as the person you've taught" [5].
Beyond connecting them with their own cultural heritage, engagement with       the research underpinning this project helped legitimise &#8212; and         therefore promote and support &#8212; discussions about race and history,       fostering a perception among its young participants that they could have       "more informed discussions", since "seeing it in the museum made it a lot       more real" [4].
Speaking about these topics encouraged some young people       to share themes of LSS with family and friends, with one participant       citing "the impact on his parents" and the "need to go away and teach"       [4].
A project facilitator reported: "I think it has broadened their       understanding to a point where they are more susceptible to further study       and understanding of black history, African history, the history of       Britain" [4].
Ultimately, moreover, the project helped empower the         young people involved, with all participants since securing       internships, education or employment [4].
As well as facilitating community engagement, such projects have promoted       creative engagement leading to the development of new artistic         products.
Examples beyond the Journeys and Kinship project include       the 2009 Living Ancestors project, an artistic tribute to the women of       Dominica, and a November 2012 poetry group on the topic of sugar, led by       Malika Booker [6].
Loss &amp; Liberty (August-November 2009) involved the       creation of a television broadcast by offenders at Wandsworth Prison as       part of the prison's arts education programme.
The programme shows how       prisoners were able to use both images and text from the displays in LSS       to connect with understandings of their own history, as well as to express       feelings around their loss of identity and separation from family as they       experience it within the prison system [7].
In turn the ceramic artworks       they produced inspired by ideas of freedom and liberty formed a temporary       part of LSS.
Bressey's research has also delivered educational benefits through         its use in a series of School Slavery Study Days at LSS.
These       events, which are delivered by education staff at MoLD and run on average       five days a year, are typically attended by around 105 students; with 30       events since 2008, around 2,500-3,000 students have been reached so far       [4].
The students engage with the gallery content by questioning the       relationship between slavery and London, linking subjects associated with       LSS to contemporary examples from the pupils' lives [4].
Around ten       schools send groups to the study days every year, an indication of the       continued value the schools ascribe to this engagement.
The emphasis on including diverse voices in LSS and the stress placed in       the gallery on creating accessible narratives to link the past with       present debates of identity and belonging (as demonstrated in Bressey's       research) has been a transformative agent for the MoLD, such that       Bressey's work has had additional impacts on the Museum's own curatorial         and organisational practices [10].
The MoLD Director noted that,       following the development of LSS, the Museum has been forced to rethink       how, for example, press officers write releases referring to race and       ethnicity, as well as the type of additional awareness training required       by museum staff [9].
"Dr Bressey," he noted, "was able to supplement the       work and knowledge of the museum's curators, and to provide a vital link       with the consultative body which was created to inform the gallery.
With       Caroline's assistance, a gallery was created that has attracted       considerable interest and attention from both visitors and museologists"       [9].
The LSS gallery was designed to challenge the usual interpretations       of the history of slavery from outside, including through consultation       with communities, provision of collaborative spaces, and reflections on       academic and lived narratives.
These provided an example of best practice       for the museum's practitioners in their development of subsequent       successful exhibitions: LSS methods were, for example, applied to the       hugely successful 'Jack the Ripper and the East End' MoLD exhibition       (May-November 2008), which attracted an audience of over 56,000 [1], and       LSS was used as a model for the MoLD's new gallery development for Many       East Ends, introduced in a display in September 2012 [10].
