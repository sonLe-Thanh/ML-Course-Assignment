     Cardiovascular disease, resulting from damage to the heart, blood vessels       or both, is the leading cause of death worldwide.
Current estimates       suggest that more than 7000 European and American adults die of       cardiovascular disease every day.
Heart disease, a major form of       cardiovascular disease, is a broad term used to describe heart failure,       heart attack and angina, all of which present a substantial economic       burden to healthcare services.
For example, in 2010-2011, it is estimated       that the NHS spent in excess of &#163;2 billion on patients with heart failure,       with around 70% of this expenditure reflecting hospitalisation.
Medical       therapy limits heart disease progression and patients are typically       treated with a lifelong prescription of multiple classes of drugs.
Since       2008, landmark clinical trials with leadership involvement of the RCB have       led to the expansion of therapeutic options for patients with heart       failure.
Regulatory approval     Conducting well-designed RCTs to determine whether medications are safe       and effective is the lynchpin of gaining regulatory approval for their use       in patients.
Ivabradine (brand name, Procoralan) was originally approved       by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2005 specifically for the       treatment of long-term angina among people with normal heart rhythm.
The       findings of BEAUTIFUL prompted the manufacturer of this drug (leading       French pharmaceutical company Servier) to apply for an extension to the       original indication (angina).a In October 2009, the EMA       approved ivabradine as an add-on therapy (on top of beta blockers) for the       treatment of long-term angina in patients with coronary artery disease and       normal heart rhythm.b The BEAUTIFUL study (CL3-056) was       extensively cited as key supporting evidence for clinical benefit and       acceptable safety profile in this application (sections I.2.2 and I.2.3).
In March 2012, the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use       (CHMP) granted a further request by Servier to extend the indications for       ivabradine to include patients with chronic heart failure.b The       SHIFT study (CL3-16257-063) was cited as the sole supporting evidence in       the CHMP assessment report (sections 1.1, 2.1, 2.3, 2.4 and 3).
Consequently, the CHMP recommendation for this novel use of ivabradine       (variation C.I.6.a; section 4) was based entirely on information made       available by the SHIFT investigators.
Commenting on the key role of the RCB in this approval process, Servier's       Director of the Division for Medical Affairs stated that `The         internationally recognised combination of outstanding biostatistical         skill, knowledge of the disease area and experience in large         cardiovascular clinical outcome trials...highlighted the synergy between         the [RCBs] expertise and our own research aims in developing treatments         for heart disease...[the] findings of BEAUTIFUL and particularly SHIFT         were pivotal in Servier's successful application to the EMA in 2012 to         extend the original licence for ivabradine in stable angina to include         heart failure'.a     The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) is responsible for assessing new       treatments for use within NHS Scotland.
The SMC approved the restricted       use of ivabradine for chronic heart failure in September 2012, citing       SHIFT as the sole evidence base for this decision.c In November       2012, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)       approved ivabradine for this application throughout the NHS.d       The NICE technical appraisal document (TA 267) cites SHIFT in the evidence       as the "only randomised controlled trial that assessed the effect of         ivabradine in people with heart failure" (section 3.1).
Regulatory       approval of ivabradine in 2012 was widely reported by major UK media       outlets, including the Telegraph, Guardian, Mail         Online and Daily Mirror, reaching a potential audience of       approximately 9 million.e Specialist coverage included NHS       Choices, theheart.org, and the British Heart Foundation.
Generic drug formulations can significantly lower health costs and       improve access to treatment once brand-name drugs come off patent.
Data       from IONA was cited in the evidence base supporting the marketing of       generic nicorandil in the UK.
This application was approved by the       Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in November       2010.f     Clinical guidelines     RCB research has underpinned high-level recommendations in the leading       international and national guidelines on the management of patients with       heart disease.
The joint American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart       Association (ACCF/AHA, estimated professional membership of 73,000)       guideline on the management of heart failure was published in June 2013.g       The CAPRICORN study of carvedilol is cited in this guideline and underpins       the following highest level (Level I) recommendations:             In patients with heart attack (myocardial infarction; MI) and           reduced heart output (ejection fraction; EF), evidence-based beta           blockers should be used to prevent heart           failure.
Use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality is recommended           for all stable patients.
Similarly, the DOT-HF results have been included in the evidence base to       form guideline recommendations on device therapy for management of chronic       (Stage C) heart failure.
In May 2012, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC; estimated       professional membership of 80,000) published guidelines on the diagnosis       and treatment of heart failure.h These guidelines cite SHIFT,       BEAUTIFUL and CAPRICORN.
Data from SHIFT and BEAUTIFUL underpin the       following recommendations on the use of ivabradine:             Should be considered to reduce the risk of heart           failure hospitalisation in patients in sinus rhythm with an EF &#8804;35%, a           heart rate remaining &#8805;70 bpm, and persisting symptoms (NYHA class           II-IV) despite treatment with an evidence-based dose of beta-blocker           (or maximum tolerated dose below that), ACE inhibitor (or ARB), and an           MRA (or ARB).
SHIFT is cited as the sole underpinning evidence.
Should be considered in patients in sinus rhythm who           cannot tolerate a beta-blocker, to relieve angina (effective           antianginal treatment and safe in HF).
SHIFT and BEAUTIFUL are the         only studies cited.
The addition of ivabradine is recommended           when angina persists despite treatment with a beta-blocker (or           alternative), to relieve angina (effective antianginal treatment and           safe in HF).
SHIFT and BEAUTIFUL are the only studies cited.
Data from CAPRICORN underpins the following recommendation for carvedilol:             A beta-blocker is recommended in patients           with an EF &#8804;40%, after stabilization, to reduce the risk of death and           recurrent myocardial infarction.
CAPRICORN is the only study         cited.
More than 158,000 copies of this guideline have been downloaded from the       ESC website, making it the leading downloaded guideline in the ESC series       in 2012.i These data are complemented by a further 28,500       downloads of the ESC pocket guideline version, with a worldwide readership       including South America, India and China.
The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) develops       evidence-based clinical guidelines for NHS Scotland.
In February 2013,       SIGN published a guideline on acute coronary syndromes.j       CAPRICORN is cited as the sole evidence in support of the following       highest level recommendation:             Patients with clinical myocardial infarction should be maintained           on long term beta blocker therapy.
In summary, these landmark clinical trials with leadership involvement of       the RCB (described in section 2) have widened therapeutic options for       patients with heart failure worldwide.
