     The reach and significance of this research can be       demonstrated through:            The incorporation of Portsmouth research and resulting data in the UK         government's benchmark definition of stress at work.
The wide range of UK organisations which have used the QoWL tool to         survey and improve conditions for their staff, including 10% of all UK         universities (including Cardiff, Essex, London School of Hygiene and         Tropical Medicine, LSE, QMU, and Sheffield) and some of the largest UK         Trade Unions (including the Police Federation, TUC, Unite);       The many translations and applied use of the scale across the world         (including India, Iran, Philippines, Turkey), and the extent of media         coverage it has attracted at home and abroad.
This research has not only had a demonstrable health and welfare         impact, but also a strong economic, commercial and         organisational impact.
In 2008, building on an award of       &#163;71,000 from the University's Higher Education Investment Fund (HEIF) to       commercialise this research, a university spinout company, QoWL Ltd, was       formed.

Contributing to the development of UK government stress benchmarks     At the national level, current Health and Safety Law requires       that if work-related stress is suspected in employees then it must be       assessed.
This led the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to develop a       Stress Management Standards questionnaire in 2005.
The Portsmouth team       played an integral role in helping validate this questionnaire and were       actively consulted in the construction of the HSE Management Standards       (MS) psychometric scale and stress-intervention procedure that has been in       place since 2008 to help employers manage work-related stress.
The Manager       of the HSE Stress Area confirms that more than ten per cent of the current       HSE MS benchmark data was contributed by Portsmouth QoWL researchers and       that "the benchmark data- set has formed a key element of the UK       government's definition and approach to tackling organisational stress"       (Corroborating Person &#8212; CP1).
Significantly, since 2008 an estimated       "...17,000 organisations, including 80% of Local Government Authorities,       and more than 1 million staff have used the management standards scale and       the associated benchmarks to assess the factors that affect the health and       wellbeing of their staff."

In 2011 Van Laar worked with the       Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA) and Robertson       Cooper Ltd to link QoWL university employee wellbeing data to NSS       organisational scores (p. 28-9), which led to specific guidelines for         HR professionals on implementing effective wellbeing strategies       across the HE sector (Corroborating Source &#8212; CS1).

Improving workplace wellbeing: the application of the WRQoL scale         and QoWL surveys     At the organisational level, WRQoL based QoWL staff surveys have       typically been employed by Human Resource (HR) departments to identify       organisational shortcomings so that remedial policies can be introduced in       order to improve organisational satisfaction and to enhance the working       life of employees.
In the majority of cases, organisations have paid for       Van Laar and colleagues to set up, analyse and report the WRQoL and       wellbeing of their staff, demonstrating the economic and commercial         value of such surveys.
For example, since 2007 the University of       Huddersfield, a large UK University employing over 1,600 staff, has       conducted a WRQoL based QoWL survey every two years, using the data       provided by the surveys to drive change in many ways (CS2).
In 2009, QoWL       survey results "allowed us to focus on sickness absence" (CP2), prompting       the introduction of a new sickness absence procedure that led to "a 16%       reduction in sickness absence with average days lost per employee now at       4.4, significantly below the HE average of 6.2" and "days lost since       2007/8 for stress/mental ill health for academic staff have more than       halved from 1453 days to 604 days, a saving estimated to be in the region       of &#163;100,000 p.a."
(CP2).
Leeds College of Music, a specialist UK conservatoire college, have used       the WRQoL survey three times across five years (2008-2013) to `drive       change' in the organisation by emphasising the organisation's social         responsibility and management support for employees.
The 2008 survey       identified inconsistencies in management training programmes &#8212; leading to       the introduction of a formal management and leadership induction course       for all its (40) managers.
Other changes introduced as a direct       consequence of survey findings include changing the way requests for       flexible working are dealt with and improved staff communications, causing       "home-work interface approval rates to rise by 12% and overall [staff]       satisfaction levels to rise by 16%" (CP3).
The Director of Work-Life       Solutions, a Business Psychology consultancy which has worked with more       than 10 commercial clients using the QoWL survey confirms that the tool       has allowed "clients to gain a competitive advantage over similar       organisations through allowing them to demonstrate lower costs of absence       and staff turnover and to become more attractive to talent through       improved reputation."

TheWRQoL scale and QoWL surveys: International and Media Reach.
The global reach of the WRQoWL scale developed at Portsmouth is evidenced       by requests from more than 340 researchers from over 50 countries to use       the scale since 2008 (CS3).
The WRQoL scale is downloaded on average 100       times a month from the www.qowl.co.uk       web-site and the scale has been officially translated by researchers into       11 languages to date, including Chinese, Farsi, Hungarian, Spanish, Thai       and Turkish.
The QoWL/Portsmouth research has also been widely cited by journalists,       broadcasters and social media.
It has formed the basis for the lead       article on the BBC Business web-site in 2009, and has helped to shape       public debate about the engagement of older employees in work (CS4).
