     Developing high fidelity models is both a challenge and an opportunity       for the process and energy industrial sectors.
Such models allow the       de-risking of new designs, facilitate scale up, and help to troubleshoot       and debottleneck existing operations.
The returns on investment in       modelling exercises are in principle very high relative to the potential       benefits.
However, the development and analysis of process models is a       challenging task due to the need for a high level of user skill, and the       need for effective tools for model description and model solution.
In       1997, Process Systems Enterprises Limited (PSE) was formed by a team of       academics (Macchietto, Pantelides, Perkins, Pistikopoulos, Shah) from the       CPSE to meet these challenges, and to ensure the impact of research from       the CPSE.
Since 1993 CPSE has operated an industrial consortium.
Member companies       of this consortium (ranging in number between 8 and 12 over the years,       with typical fees of &#163;15,000 per annum) have an opportunity to evaluate       software prototypes (under special licences) and provide feedback.
This       model of prototyping, testing and feedback proved an invaluable part of       the commercialisation process.
It helped to ensure that once PSE was       launched, a software platform that would meet the needs of users was       available.
This combination of basic and industrially-oriented research,       together with strong user engagement in the research and development       phase, meant that there was a queue of ready customers as soon as the       commercial version of the technology was made available.
Additionally       Professor Costas Pantelides, who was the team leader for the R&amp;D       activities, moved from CPSE to PSE Ltd in 2000 where he continues as the       Managing Director to date, while retaining a 0.4FTE position in the CPSE.
Additional routes through which the impact has taken place include the       provision of consultancy services by staff from the Dept to PSE, the       recruitment by PSE of PhD students and research associates and the       facilitation by PSE of a partnership agreement between ABB and Imperial       College.
At the launch of PSE, the gPROMSTM modelling platform,       including modelling language, solution algorithms, results visualisation       and prototype user interface, comprised an IP package that was licensed to       the company by Imperial Innovations, in return for 35% of the equity.
Hence the research outputs formed the core of the company's assets.
The       company then worked on improving the usability, developing documentation,       business development and incorporating new innovations arising from CPSE.
PSE Ltd has so far solely commercialised IP arising from the CPSE, and all       its revenues can be traced back to the research at the CPSE.
Important       impact indicators for PSE Ltd include:            A thriving company which has current annual revenue of &#163;10m and         cumulative revenues since inception of &#163;97m (approx &#163;40m during the REF         period).
A global presence (with offices in the UK, US, Germany, Japan and         Korea, and agencies in Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Thailand, Malaysia, China         and Taiwan with over 60% (on average) of revenues from outside the UK;         it is therefore a key export earner[19].
PSE employs approximately 100 people in high-end jobs.
PSE's products are in routine use in major companies (including 7 of         the world's top 10 chemical companies) and over 200 universities, and         form part of industrial practice.
PSE has an ongoing record of innovation with new products (e.g.
in         solids [12], offshore safety [14], and systems modelling in healthcare,         including pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics [13]).
PSE's platform enables the easy construction and solution of first       principles models with a powerful and user-friendly tool; this has made       possible a variety of new approaches to model based process design and       optimisation such as:            design of a new chemical process for a Korean chemical company that         saved $5m in reactor costs alone [8];       design of a new, "cleaner" propylene oxide process [10], where the         user could consider all the trade-offs across the whole process         simultaneously and therefore ensure a global optimisation while         implementing a process which decouples the production of propylene oxide         from that of styrene.
Dr Hilario Rodriguez of Repsol states "We           increased total annualised profit by several tens of millions of           &#8364;/year" [8];       design of new integrated devices such as fuel cells [11], including         effective systems engineering and design, and the consideration of         issues such as water management and heat transfer, which enables the         design of fuel cells which are robust to transient operation;       design of new crystallisation processes [12], which enables tight         control of particle size distribution;       scale up of an impact mill [15], where P&amp;G reduced risk and         experimental effort through modelling;       Optimising the production of terephthaldehyde (TPAL) [16] through         multiscale modelling, resulting in much better temperature control,         saving $2m-$4m per year;       Improved life cycle service offers from a catalyst manufacturer to its         clients [17], where models are used to advise the catalyst         manufacturer's clients on the optimal operation of their processes.
All of the above have been undertaken by PSE's industrial clients, who       are generally in the chemicals, energy and health, foods and lifestyle       industries.
Typically, the return on investment in modelling these       applications using PSE software and consulting is at least 10 and in the       case of [8] below closer to 100.
The overall impact from         commercialisation of modelling tools based on research in the CPSE over         the REF period is therefore around &#163;400m, and since inception in 1997,         &#163;1bn.
The Chemical Systems Discipline Head of P&amp;G [18] has       indicated his willingness to corroborate this impact and respond to panel       queries.
PSE's vision of model-based applications used throughout the process       lifecycle is now being realised, with modelling supporting discovery (e.g.
in pharmaceuticals [12,13]), design (across a wide range of operations)       and operations (e.g.
safety assessment [14]).
The impact of the commercialisation of the software from CPSE was       recognised when four of the academic staff (Machietto, Pantelides,       Pistikopoulos, Shah) involved in launching PSE were part of a 5 person       team awarded the MacRobert Award and Prize in 2007.
This is the UK's       premier award for engineering innovation and recognises "world leading         engineering developments...." Which demonstrate innovation, commercial         success, and benefits to the community" [9].
