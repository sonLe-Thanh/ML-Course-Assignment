     The underpinning research has made a direct contribution to preserving       and presenting the medieval cultural heritage of the Northern German       convents.
The Protestant female communities who now inhabit these convents       are keenly interested in learning more about their spiritual and cultural       heritage, which is present in their everyday life as they are the       custodians of its medieval buildings, tapestries, archives, libraries and       art works.
The Abbess of Medingen comments on the significance of the       collaboration with L&#228;hnemann: "It [the link to academic research] is         very important for us today and I see it as an obligation, as Medingen         has always been concerned with both learning and religion, not to lose         sight of either of these.
And with Professor L&#228;hnemann &#8212; it just all         comes together beautifully; I think this kind of collaboration is a         highly sustainable model for the future" (IMP1).
The       research brought significant new insight and knowledge about the period       and as a result led to a more informed and in some cases considerably       revised interpretation of their medieval heritage by these communities.
As       a direct result, new knowledge is being used to inform new displays,       exhibitions and the information shared with the thousands of visitors who       visit the convents annually (IMP2).
L&#228;hnemann's engagement with the convents has led to a fruitful chain of       instruction and knowledge-sharing, as the Abbess of L&#252;ne highlights: "We         are of course very curious about our medieval heritage and want to know         more about the inscriptions and manuscripts.
We cannot interpret them         fully by ourselves and Prof L&#228;hnemann can say much more about them,         information which we are delighted to make use of, as we will do this         afternoon when 25 of our voluntary tourist guides meet .... We convent         residents cannot manage to show the several thousands of visitors per         year around by ourselves and thus it is important that the guides too         benefit from Prof L&#228;hnemann's knowledge" (IMP3).
This productive collaboration has resulted in an overhaul of convent       museum exhibitions, websites and brochures for tourist visitors.
A tour       guide at Mariensee describes the benefits of the annual training led by       L&#228;hnemann as an "absolute highlight", expressing the infectious       enthusiasm with which L&#228;hnemann re-created the environment of a medieval       scriptorium and the performance of the liturgy in all its materiality: "...the         detailed knowledge she shares with us enhances our own general knowledge         about the history and art treasures of the convent ...
In a similar         manner, we can now pass on our knowledge, something from which school         classes in particular benefit" (IMP4).
Another example where the underpinning research had direct influence is       in the setting up of a new convent museum at Mariensee in 2007, intended       to convey basic knowledge of Protestant convents to a broad audience.
The       Abbess of Mariensee confirms that the convent museum "evolved from a         suggestion by Prof. L&#228;hnemann" and added "...the question of how         to present the only medieval manuscript [of a prayer book]         still existing in the convent developed into an intense dialogue.
We         were able to profit from both Prof L&#228;hnemann's research and practical         knowledge" (IMP5).
Evidence of the transfer of knowledge is       captured in the production of a bookmark [see image] which has on it the       translation and contextualisation of a particular passage from this prayer       book.
This emblematic bookmark is distributed not only locally at       Mariensee but also nationally through the hundreds of visitors who attend       the Kirchentage [nation-wide Protestant gatherings].
Here       workshops take place that use the sample prayer on the bookmark to teach       participants how a medieval nun would have written.
Bookmark based on the prayer book of Odilia von Alden, Abbess of Mariensee        L&#228;hnemann's research is extending its impact further as evidenced by her       appointment as a consultant for a new project to turn a side chapel in St       John's, the main church of L&#252;neburg, into an exhibition space to document       its spiritual heritage.
The Lutheran Superintendent of L&#252;neburg describes       L&#228;hnemann's comments on the fragments of a liturgical manuscript as an "eye-opener"       which "allow us to re-enact parts of it with our guests and         those preparing for confirmation and to show them the differences         between modern and medieval reading" &#8212; thereby informing their own,       contemporary, spirituality (IMP6).
As a direct result of the research being conducted, several of the       medieval manuscripts from Medingen have now been fully digitised.
Through       a link on the convent website (IMP7) these manuscripts have, as it       were, been returned to the convent.
This "home coming" of the manuscripts       received widespread coverage in the local press.
For example, the article       `Von Medingen nach Michigan.
Eine Detektivgeschichte' [`From Medingen to       Michigan.
A Detective Story'] recounts the journey of one medieval       manuscript from the convents to the United States, and appears in a 4-page       colour weekend supplement to the Allgemeine Uelzener Zeitung       (circulation: 16,499) (IMP8).
Through L&#228;hnemann's collaboration with practitioners, the underpinning       research has also changed aspects of professional practice.
For example,       the transcription and contextualisation of text fragments enabled two       textile restorers from the Klosterkammer Hannover [the Board responsible       for the convents] to gain valuable insights about some small garments.
As       a result, they continue to adopt a more holistic approach in their       analysis and cataloguing, now working with a range of scholars from other       disciplines.
This collaboration also resulted in a shared publication (4)       and provoked lively interest at a public presentation in the convent of       L&#252;ne (IMP10) and when it was featured in the 'Heimatkalender       Uelzen 2012', the calendar distributed by all local firms to their       customers as a Christmas gift (IMP9).
The collaboration also made       the national news when subsequently one of the garments was chosen for the       exhibition 'Rosenkr&#228;nze und Seeleng&#228;rten' to make devotional life in the       convents tangible to the wider public.
This integration of       state-of-the-art research into a popular exhibition was very positively       reviewed in the German newspapers, not least the leading broadsheet FAZ       [Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung].
