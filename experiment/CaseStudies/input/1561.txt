     Thompson's work has wide and deep impact on government policy.
The       Thompson Report, (Ref 1) moved forward the Labour government's Open       Standards agenda; formed the basis for the Conservative Party 2010       Technology Manifesto; was highly influential in reports from HM       Government's Chief Technology Officer at the Cabinet Office, the Public       Accounts Committee and the Public Administration Select Committee.
In       2009, Chancellor George Osborne and the Cabinet Office announced a       contract cap of &#163;100m for all government ICT projects.
This was a direct       recommendation in Ref 1.
Thompson was asked to assist the Cabinet       Office's Efficiency and Reform Group in drafting and trailing the       announcement of this initiative, which had a major impact on the strategic       and commercial context of the government procurement and supply chain (Source         4).
Whilst direct impact can be traced to two core research documents Ref         1 and 2, they are but part of Thompson's credible platform of       closely related activities in research, policy development, advice and       guidance, written critique, and trialling of Open Innovation ideas within       the UK public sector, which together led to a `sea change' in government       ICT thinking, broader impact on the UK technology industry, and on       Intellect, the UK's leading technology trade association.
Thompson was co-author of Better for Less: How to make the government         deliver IT savings, a 2011 white paper published by the Network         for the Post-bureaucratic Age, which builds on recommendations of       Open Source and Open Standards, and forms the `playbook' for Francis       Maude's formation of the Cabinet Office Efficiency &amp; Reform Group (Source         4, Source 8).
Cabinet Office (2011) Government IT Strategy       is based around Open Standards and draws on the Thompson Report       and Better for Less (Source 4, Source 9).
The Chief Technology Officer, Cabinet Office, confirms the impact of       Thompson's work on government IT policy, in generating IT cost savings,       and his substantial contribution to Better for Less as the key       driver in the Open Standards component, to the 2011 government IT strategy       and explanation of Open Standards.
Thompson's work has also influenced       behaviour through assistance in setting up an ICT spend controls       methodology, which has been successful in government and adopted by the       OECD.
As a direct consequence, the government will have saved over &#163;1       billion of spending over the next 5 years, &#163;400 million of this in 2012 (Source         4).
The Chairman of the Public Administration Select Committee (PASC) refers       to Thompson's direct impact on the committee's ability to scrutinise       government policies and their implementation.
Thompson contributed to       their 2012 report, Government and IT &#8212;`a recipe for rip-offs': Time         for a new approach.
The PASC provided Parliamentary approval for the       Open Standards approach recommended by Thompson et al.
(Source 3,         Source 5).
Cabinet Office (2011) Government IT Strategy Strategic Implementation         Plan: Moving from the `what' to the `how' draws directly on Ref         2 for its entire approach, as acknowledged by HM Government Chief       Technology Officer (Source 2, Source 4 ).
Head et al.
(2012) Planting the Flag: Strategic Sourcing, Pocket       Guide Number 4, Society of Information Technology Management (SOCITM: the       national association for local government IT directors/CIOs) is based       directly on (Ref 2) (Source 7) and is used as best practice to       guide ICT procurement.
As a Cabinet Office Advisor (2011- ), Thompson has supported co-authors       Maxwell and Fishenden to gain a platform for their ideas in government,       despite initially very strong cultural resistance.
Two examples are       Thompson's preparation of an Open Desktop Strategy White Paper for       the Cabinet Office (Source 9), and his `Delivery Approach &amp;       Principles' (Fig.
2) fronting up the Cabinet Office ICT Strategic       Implementation Plan (Source 2).
Thompson's work has also impacted the UK technology industry and the       activities of Intellect, the UK's leading technology trade association.
He       presented work on Open Source and Open Standards, as delivered to       George Osborne, to the Intellect Annual Conference, 2009.
He showed that       progressive use of open standards and platform-based re-use by the public       sector would revolutionise the design and delivery of UK public services       and supporting technology, and that this would dramatically impact       business models in the industry, creating a `level playing field' that       would offer SMEs greater access to government business.
The Director       General of Intellect acknowledges Thompson's work, `this was a new         message, and at the time was not accepted by everyone' (Source 6).
Thompson was elected to the board of Intellect.
He advocated the need for       change in order to respond to the fast-changing technological and       commercial landscape.
This led Intellect to make the following strategic       changes now being implemented: i) wholesale adoption of an internet-based       platform to facilitate networking, both internally and to government, ii)       a `market radar', providing real-time visibility of the emergence of new       supply and value chains and partnering clusters, iii) greater focus on       campaign management and social media (Source 6).
There is considerable press interest from broadsheet publications and       national media; Thompson is a frequent plenary speaker at national       conferences, including at the Number 10 `Better Procurement' event       (attended by David Cameron, with Francis Maude as discussant), Govnet Next       Steps for Government ICT Conference (2012); Public Service Reform       Conference, (2012), and has shared platforms with Lord Freud, Paula       Venellis (Chief Executive of the Post Office) and Lord Erroll on public       sector reform.
Thompson has also advised seven local councils on       redesigning services using Open Standards.
