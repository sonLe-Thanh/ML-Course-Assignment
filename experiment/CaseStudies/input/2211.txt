     Research into the characteristics and remediation of mining pollution has       had sustained and significant impacts on policy and practice at regional,       national and international scales.
Examples of impacts within the period       01/08 - 07/13, all with documentary evidence, include:     (A) Regional impact on the economy and environment     On research undertaken by the Newcastle University team on the River Tyne       the Minister for the North East of England at the time of the impact,       commented that (S1):     "... our hopes for the regeneration of industrial Tyneside, and the         thousands of jobs that already rely on that regeneration, are         underpinned by the work you have undertaken"     This impact arose from applying research findings (e.g.
O1) on       metal fluxes under varying hydrological conditions (2010 - 2012), and       demonstrated that metal pollutants in estuarine sediments of the River       Tyne are associated with abandoned mines 60 km upstream, not contemporary       industry located on the banks of the estuary.
This has critically shaped       plans for engineering interventions to address the problems (S1).
(B) National impact on policy makers and the environment     NU research (O2, O3) demonstrated that 8% of all       waterbodies in England and Wales fail to meet EU WFD objectives due to       pollution from abandoned mines (S2).
This directly informed Defra's       decision to release &#163;10.5M of funding to the EA (S3) in 2011,       specifically to monitor pollution effectively and construct new treatment       systems.
NU has had a major impact in both areas of work, as detailed       below.
Abandoned metal mines are explicitly mentioned (page 37) in HM       Government's White Paper on water (December 2011) as a result of the NU       team's quantification of the problems, and data from the team's research       is used in the White paper (S4).
In allocating these funds to       specific activities the Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser at Defra stated (S3):     "..in utilising &#163;1.2 million of this funding (during 2012 - 2013) the         Environment Agency has directly adopted the monitoring practices         recommended by the Newcastle University team.."     and, in relation to the first large-scale passive mine water treatment       system to be built, that     "funded from Defra's &#163;10.5 million investment, via the Coal Authority,         the treatment process and system size were directly determined by the         Newcastle team ..."     These are clear statements of the impact of the team's research from       2009, in influencing government policy and investment in environmental       problems, on the environment regulator's practices in addressing this form       of pollution, and on the engineering solutions adopted for treating mine       water pollution (more details below).
(C) National impact on practitioners and the environment     The UK Coal Authority (CA) engaged the NU team (2011) to lead on the       design of the first ever large-scale passive metal mine water treatment       system in the UK, a &#163;1M system that commenced construction in September       2013.
The Director of Operations at the Coal Authority acknowledges that (S5):     "The overall treatment process, including treatment unit type and         size, was determined by Newcastle University following research and         development by the research team between 2009 and 2012 ..."     This will be the blueprint for schemes in the coming decades (S5).
The treatment system is a directly scaled up version of the       bioreactors developed through research (G6, G7, O4),       thus clearly linking the research and impact.
The EA is undertaking nationwide investigations (from 2012) of       mining-polluted river catchments, at a cost of &#163;1.2M (S3).
The       catchments were selected directly from NU research (G3, O2).
The EA has modified its approach to monitoring based on the NU team's       recommendations in light of its research on diffuse pollution (O1,       S3).
Recognising the importance of the work, both EA and CA engaged       the NU team to deliver training courses (2010 - 2011) on mining pollution       to 75 of their organisations' staff i.e.
virtually all of their staff       involved in mining pollution.
The CA has commented on these training       courses that "... no other organisation has provided more technical         training to our staff ... than the Newcastle University team" (S5).
(D) International impact on practitioners     Internationally, the Global Acid Rock Drainage (GARD) Guide was an       initiative of the world's major mining houses.
The GARD Guide is the first       comprehensive international guidance document on mining pollution       management.
A web-based document (http://www.gardguide.com),       as at 04/2013 the GARD Guide had been accessed by 161,000 users, 176,000       by 06/2013 (S6), 193,000 by 08/2013, and 206,000 by 10/2013.
Two       members of the NU team sat on the committees that shaped both the       structure and content of the Guide (2008 - 2009), and so the team is       indirectly having a continuing impact on the practice of thousands of       professionals worldwide.
That NU was the only organisation in the world to be represented twice on       these committees (http://www.inap.com.au/committees.htm)       is recognition by the international mining community of the impact of the       team's applied research, and a reflection of the team's unique       understanding of both technical and policy issues related to mining       pollution in Europe (S6).
The multinational mining company Rio       Tinto stated that (S6):     "...there is no question that the Newcastle University team has had a         worldwide impact on the practice of professionals in the mining sector         dealing with mine water pollution"     The clear influence of the NU team is further made plain in Section 1,       Chapter 1 of the GARD Guide: "The target audience is adapted from a         model developed by the PIRAMID Consortium (2003)"; a reference to       the major output, authored by the NU team, of an EC project led by NU (http://www.imwa.info/piramid/files/PIRAMIDGuidelinesv10.pdf;       G1).
The GARD Guide also references the team's policy work, such as       G2 (O5).
(E) International impacts on public policy and services     Underpinned by research in Europe and the Americas (G2, G4,       O6), NU's work in the Arequipa region of Peru had impacts on public       policy and services; the team led the formation of an official advisory       group which wrote guidelines on river basin management in mining areas for       the Arequipa region, with involvement from all key stakeholders (S8).
Because of this expertise the NU team has been engaged by the Catholic       Agency for Overseas Development (CAFOD) Andean Programme (2012 - 2013) to       provide policy advice and support to local authorities and civil society       in one of the highest profile mining conflicts in Peru (Tintaya mine,       Espinar), and were officially accepted by the environmental working group       set up by the Prime Minister's Office (S7), with participation of       three Ministries, to resolve these issues (S7).
Consequently the       team has had direct impact on the establishment of long-term monitoring       programmes, definition of regional policies overseas, and the practices of       NGOs, as recognised by CAFOD, that comments (S7):     "Working with Newcastle University has opened a series of different         options and strategies for changing government policy and practice which         had previously been closed to NGOs"
