     The total cost of the Ejyafjallaj&#246;kull eruption has been estimated at &#163;3       billion by Oxford Economics       in 2010 [a], with seven million passengers affected by the       cancellation of 107,000 flights.
The net       impact on UK GDP has been estimated to be &#163;466 million [b].
The       eruption of Grimsv&#246;tn (Iceland)       in 2011, a much larger eruption, only caused the cancellation of 900       flights, with subsequent costs       being on the order of 1% of that caused by Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull cloud.
This       is, in part, due to improved       understanding of ash clouds and their likely impact on UK airspace and       airports by decision       makers, through advice provided by the School's experts [c].
During the Iceland volcanic ash crisis of 2010, Sparks, Aspinall and       Watson were invited to join the       Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) set up by Professor Sir       John Beddington (then       Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK Government) to "report directly to         the Prime Minister and Cabinet         Office Briefing Room (COBR)" meetings [b].
Bristol       University was the only institution on the       committee (made up of 20 academics and senior civil servants) to have more       than one       representative.
This was a direct result of their recognition as leaders       in their fields, specifically       plume dispersion [1], statistical volcanology and risk [3,5],       and satellite and microscopic       observations [2,4,6].
The research experience of the Bristol       academics was used extensively to       drive discussion within SAGE on source terms for models [d],       particularly application of the `Sparks       curve' which relates column height (observable) to mass eruption rate       (critical model source term)       [e].
This curve provides the underlying capability for mass       estimation that is vital during stages of       an eruption where observations are sparse and "forms the basis of the         quantitative concentration         predictions provided by the London VAAC for the ICAP European and North         Atlantic Volcanic Ash         Contingency Plan" [e].
Sparks also emphasised the importance       of near-source fall out of ash       caused by aggregation, which has helped the Met Office to increase their       confidence in the       standard approaches used, and to obtain a better understanding of the       variability that might be       expected for different eruptions [e].
At these meetings, Aspinall       led the discussion over concerns       that Katla (a volcano close to Ejyafjallaj&#246;kull with apparent       near-simultaneous historical eruptions)       could be triggered, and determined a likelihood for (i) a larger future       eruption, (ii) the importance of       including volcanic ash clouds in the national risk register [b,f],       and (iii) the need to better integrate       (and assimilate) satellite observations into Lagrangian dispersion models.
It has been recognised       by the UK's Department for Transport that "the advice given by SAGE         following the eruption played         an important part in the Government's immediate response, with the         expertise of its members         helping establish the evidence base needed to make difficult operational         decisions" [b].
Clear pull-through is demonstrable from the recommendations of SAGE and       the Volcanic Ash       Observations Review Group (VAORG), with "short-, mid- and long-term         goals being set by VAORG         for the London VAAC (based at the Met Office) for improving UK volcanic         ash resilience" [b].
In       particular, the initial report (2011) from the VAORG to the Secretary of       State lists four main       recommendations to which the only three academics on the committee       (Watson, Sparks and       Aspinall) clearly spoke; these are to (i) constrain and reduce uncertainty       (Sparks, Aspinall), (ii)       improve observations and their usage, particularly for satellite       observations (Watson), (iii) develop       a priori source term development (Sparks), and (iv) utilise `expert       elicitation' (Aspinall).
This last       point details the use of a method that pools the opinions of a group of       specialists, using differential       weights based on empirical testing of their abilities to judge accurately       any relevant uncertainties       [3,5].
The goal is to quantify relevant uncertainties for       appropriate inclusion in decision-making.
Consequently, it has been acknowledged that "the specific sector         knowledge of Bristol University         staff...has been a key factor in their [sic (SAGE and VAORG's)]         effectiveness" [b], and "the input         of Prof. Sparks, Dr Watson and Dr Aspinall played an important role in         this forum through         enhancing understanding, quantifying risks and uncertainties, and         enabling sound decision-making"       [e].
As a result, "a number of these recommendations have been         carried out, resulting in         improved modelling and forecasting capabilities, leading to a more         resilient aviation sector" [b].
The Icelandic crisis was international news for weeks.
During this       period, whilst also interacting       with Government and the London VAAC, Watson, Sparks and Dr Jeremy Phillips       (also School of       Earth Sciences) made dozens of media appearances over various media       formats.
These include,       for TV: Sky News, CNN, Channel 4 News, France24, BBC News 24; radio: BBC       Radio 4's Today       Programme and World at One, CBS, NPR (which operates a 38-station regional       radio network in       the US serving a regional population of 5 million people), BBC Radio       Bristol, LBC, ABC Australia,       and print: New York Times, Daily Express, El Pais, LA Times, Reuters, and       Veja (a weekly news       magazine in Brazil, the fourth most circulated in the world).
As a result,       millions of the public were       informed about the crisis and were able to make better informed decisions.
"The Met Office and London VAAC have benefited directly from the work         of and our interactions         with...the School of Earth Sciences" [e].
Whilst the Met       Office already uses the `Sparks curve' to       estimate mass eruption rate, Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull and Grimsv&#246;tn presented very       different challenges in       terms of determining both an accurate mass eruption rate and particle size       distribution.
"During         both eruptions Sparks directed discussion on accurately estimating,         based on his knowledge of         how weak plumes are influenced by wind and how fragmentation processes         control downwind         particle size" [e].
The School's interactions with the       London VAAC have been communicated to       other VAACs around the globe [g], particularly around using the       `Sparks curve' adroitly.
For       instance, throughout the 2011 Grimsv&#246;tn eruption, Sparks "was a key         member of a new source         refinement science group arranged by the Met Office to elicit expert         advice and input on this         complex issue as part of the London VAAC operational response" [e].
Interactions between the       Met Office and Bristol is illuminating fundamental near source volcanic       processes and has resulted       in the generation of a real world web based tool to improve VAAC       assessment and evaluations [g].
These interactions typify best practice in terms of academic-operational       relationships [e].
The       underpinning research conducted by Bristol researchers has "made an         ongoing contribution to the         research base and directly to decisions regarding operational         developments associated with         volcanic ash monitoring and forecasting...which is a major step forward         in national capability" [e].
Socio-economic impact born of Bristol's research extends beyond       interaction with politicians,       decision makers and the public.
Immediately after the Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull       crisis, Dr Kearns was asked       by British Airways to investigate potential volcanic ash using microscopic       techniques.
Results of       energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis on particulate material adhering to       various external surfaces       of several British Airways aircraft (leading edges of wings, jet cowlings,       windscreens), suggest that       amongst a range of materials found, many particles &lt;3 microns had a       composition similar to that       known to have erupted at Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull.
Engine manufactures also have a       critical position in       hazard mitigation.
Whilst improvements in detection and prediction       (developed in part through       Bristol's research) are demonstrable, if the amount of ash that causes       engine failure is highly       uncertain, hazard mitigation remains significantly more challenging.
Bristol researchers have built       an excellent partnership with Rolls-Royce through interaction with the       engineering team       responsible for environmental engine protection which "has been         invaluable in our understanding         of ash cloud detection and modelling.
The interaction has also         contributed substantially to our         understanding of the engineering effects ash has on engines, improved         the guidance we give to         our customers (i.e.
airlines and the defence sector) on operating our         engines in volcanic ash         environments and influenced our volcanic ash research strategy.
It also         meant that Rolls-Royce is         seen as a global centre of expertise on the effects volcanic ash has on         aircraft engines" [h].
Immediately after the Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull eruption, the European Space       Agency (ESA) convened a       workshop in order to quickly draft a position paper [g,i].
The       document contains a series of       recommendations that carefully detail observational strategies, missions       and data protocols that       are now being applied across Europe; "Research from Dr Watson underpins         the report and         contributes, with others, to European (ESA, EUMETSAT, EU etc) efforts         towards making European         airspace safer and better managed with respect to volcanic ash" [g].
This report has since been       used to raise finances for 3 internal projects (totalling &#8364;2.5 million) to       improve satellite data       retrievals, provide web-based notification services about volcanic       eruptions, and to improve ash       dispersion modelling by the inclusion of satellite data [g].
At the time of the Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull eruption, aviation authorities were "collectively         ill prepared", and       had a limited understanding of the science behind the eruption, the       formation of the plume and ash       dispersal [c].
However, "independent, impartial and robust         scientific advice and information, from a         trusted body like Bristol University, enabled us to determine an         appropriate course of action in the         face of various sources of conflicting information from other parts of         the science community, often         in the face of intense media and political pressure to resolve the         crisis" [c].
Research conducted at       Bristol has "made a very significant overall contribution that has         improved our collective ability to         react to a major volcanic event that threatens UK airspace" [c].
The CAA acknowledged that       research and advice provided by Bristol's Earth Sciences enabled them to "pursue         the right         strategic outcomes to the benefit of the UK as a whole without         compromising public safety" [c].
Research conducted at Bristol has had broad-reaching and deep impact upon       a broad range of       beneficiaries (for example, politicians and civil servants, decision       makers and risk managers, large       multinational companies and the public).
All are better informed thanks to       the interaction with       Bristol's internationally recognised academics, and will "ensure that         for any future event the UK is         even better prepared to deal with volcanic ash events and serve to         further limit the impact on the         UK economy and transport infrastructure" [c].
Volcanic       hazards are now explicit in the National       Risk Register [f], and risk to aviation has been significantly       reduced [c,e,g,h].
Volcanic ash clouds       are better understood, monitored and predicted due to use of Bristol's       extensive research efforts.
