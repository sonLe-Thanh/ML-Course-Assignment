     Our work has impacted on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of AK.
Guidelines for the prevention of AK now incorporate our findings.
For       example, the British Contact Lens Association's Guide for         practitioners and support staff on reducing infection risk in contact         lens patients makes several references to our work on risk factors       in relation to swimming, extended-wear contact lenses, and hygiene related       to contact lens cases [a].
Guidance from the College of       Optometrists on the treatment of AK cites a study conducted at Moorfields       (Lim et al 2008) which built on the underpinning research described above       [b].
We have also worked to raise practitioner and public awareness       of the risks for AK &#8212; for example our research was widely reported in 2008       [c], and the topic featured in a 2011 article, Contact Lens         Problems on patient.co.uk (citing our work), and in a 2013 case       study article in The Optician [d].
Our work on risk factors for AK has been incorporated into contact lens       packaging.
Furthermore, our work led to a new disposable contact lens case       being supplied with each bottle of contact lens solution sold.
Our       research has stimulated further work to develop new and improved cleaning       solutions and cases, and has been cited in many patents for such products       [e].
Our demonstration that chlorine-based solutions are not       effective against AK has led to this type of solution being removed from       the market &#8212; for example Softab in 1995.
In 2007, a similar occurrence of       an outbreak of AK infection was identified in the USA using our methods,       and was associated with the use of Complete Moisture Plus.
This solution       was withdrawn and accordingly no such solutions were available in the       period 2008-13.
Our research is used by manufacturers in the development       of more appropriate solutions, for example, Menicon cite our research in       their evaluation of the efficacy of a new multipurpose solution, MeniCare       Soft, against Acanthamoeba [f].
PCR for diagnosis of AK is becoming widely used in routine diagnostic       laboratories [g].
The sensitivity of this technique is between       85-95% (compared to culture, at up to 60%), and with 100% specificity.
Our       clinical studies have identified the importance of early diagnosis and       introduction appropriate therapy (within three weeks of onset) as the       major predictor of disease outcomes, since corroborated by independent       studies [h].
Biguanides (PHMB and chlorhexidine) with or without a diamidine       (propamidine or hexamidine) have become the standard of care for this       condition around the world [i].
A survey of US ophthalmologists       and vision scientists conducted in 2011 revealed that "most respondents         (97.6%) had used combination therapy with multiple agents to treat         acanthamoeba keratitis at some point in the past, whereas a smaller         proportion (47.6%) had ever used monotherapy.
Respondents most commonly         chose polyhexamethylene biguanide as the ideal choice for monotherapy         (51.4%), and dual therapy with a biguanide and diamidine as the ideal         choice for combination therapy (37.5%)" [j].
We have also formulated the only available guidelines both for the       management of persistently culture positive cases (about 5% of our       series), and for the management of the severe scleral inflammation that is       associated with the disease but which is unrelated to direct invasion of       organisms, and which has been the major reason for enucleation at our       centre; this treatment involves the use of systemic immunosuppressive       therapy and effective topical anti-amoebic therapy [k].
