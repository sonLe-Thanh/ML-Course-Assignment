     Commercial Impact Of New Business Creation With Established Viability:     Background: The invention of DRAQ5&#8482; led to the creation in       2001 of BioStatus Ltd (by Smith, Patterson and CEO Stefan Ogrodzinski; http://www.biostatus.com/aboutus.asp)       to co-develop the dye technology, gain world-wide patent protection and       develop a route for sustainable commercial impact.
A significant outcome       was the creation of a new market for far-red molecular probes (primary and       commercially-sensitive corroboration information from BioStatus Ltd CEO;       Factual Statement)5.1,5.2.
Between 2002 and 2008, BioStatus Ltd       engaged academic opinion leaders and commercial organisations with a focus       on flow cytometry - winning two New Technologies Initiative Awards       in 2005 and funding research at 4 UK universities (Cardiff, Swansea,       Nottingham and Bradford).
By 2009 BioStatus Ltd had secured granted DRAQ       patents5.3.
Biostatus Ltd remains privately owned and in 2009       moved its direct sales and product development operations into its own       2,500 sq ft office &amp; laboratory facility in Shepshed, Leicestershire5.1.
New product commercialized with revenue generation: In the       impact period, DRAQ5&#8482; alone has an accumulated earnings of $3.2m, &gt;95%       arising from export income, returning royalties of &gt;$180K5.1,5.2       with a conservative estimate of ~5 million sample assays performed       to-date.
New linked start-ups funded by revenue from the core dye technology:       In 2008 Biostatus Ltd created Biosuspensions Ltd (www.biosuspensions.com       Register No.06780280) to progress its new drug and probe delivery       technology and in 2009 created the award-winning Oncotherics Ltd (www.oncotherics.com;       Register No.06940617) to progress a new anticancer drug based on its       accumulated company expertise in molecular probe chemistry.
Global reach of the innovation: To extend commercial global       reach, from 2008 BioStatus established a widening network of key       distributors including: ThermoFisher (2009-), e-Bio (now Affymetrix;       2009-) and AbCam (2010-).
By 2013, the reach of the technology to its       research constituency was evidenced by its incorporation into research       practice world-wide in over 500 academic centres (source: client       management database Biostatus Ltd)5.1,5.2.
By March 2013 the       widening significance and intensity of the influence of DRAQ5&#8482; was       evidenced by its application featuring in 158 peer-reviewed articles (101       post-2008; source: SCOPUS) and a wider referencing of the use of DRAQ5&#8482; as       a standard reagent in 3,060 text articles (2,340 post-2008; source: Google       Scholar).
More recently, by October 2013 SCOPUS reported 925 Journal       references for DRAQ5&#8482; and 338 patent applications exploiting DRAQ       technology published world-wide.
Recognition of impact: Successful translation of research       through to product impact was recognised by the award of the 2012         Royal Society of Chemistry Teamwork in Innovation Award to Smith,       Patterson, Errington and Biostatus Ltd, "For worldwide exploitation and       impact of novel fluorescent molecular probes and cell detection       technologies in drug discovery, clinical diagnostics &amp; the life       sciences"  5.4.
Job creation: BioStatus Ltd is an ISO 9001 company,       currently employs 8 people and supports employment indirectly though       contracted activities for legal, synthesis and business support services5.1,5.2.
Impact On Business And New Medicines Discovery Sector Through Adoption         Of A New Technology:     Early partnerships with antibody suppliers (Cell Signalling Technologies       Inc, USA;www.cellsignal.com), major instrument developers (Amnis       Corporation; now EMD Millipore) and high-throughput assay developers       (Norak Biosciences, USA) led to validation for multi-colour microscopy and       imaging cytometry with product adoption by March 20085.1,5.2.
DRAQ5&#8482; (product overview video: http://www.biostatus.com/SearchResults.asp?Cat=1889)       is now used extensively on discovery imaging platforms with beneficiaries       being: GlaxoSmithKline, the world's leading pharmaceutical company (GSK       ranks #1, in the 2012 Access to Medicine Index), other major drug       companies (Roche, Bayer Schering &amp; Takeda/Nycomed) and contract       high-throughput screening organisations (eg Odyssey Thera) involved in new       medicine development for pharmaceutical clients.
Here the commercial       impact has been a simplification of cell identification routines in       imaging-based screens, cost-reduction/well, verified compatibility with       multiple green fluorescent protein reporter-based assays3.6 and       reduced attrition of naturally fluorescent drug candidates in screens5.1.
Impact On Health Through Delivering Improvements To The Analysis Of         Cells     New reagents for clinical diagnostics: DRAQ technology has       had the impact of delivering improvements to the accuracy of diagnostic       assays in a wide range of flow cytometry applications while providing       previously unattainable information or cost-savings in work flows.
An       early trial in 2004 showed that DRAQ&#8482; technology was readily adoptable by       regional flow cytometry clinical laboratory services employing cost-saving       and automated cytometers5.5.
DRAQ5 is a validated reagent in       multiple applications, typical examples are: improved rare cell detection       in clinical diagnosis5.6, 5.7, more accurate myeloid to       erythroid precursors ratio determinations and a simplified workflow in       bone marrow analysis for haemato-oncology5.8, and improved       detection of nucleated erythroblasts5.9.
Evidence of widespread adoption in clinical assays: DRAQ5&#8482;       is featured directly in 29 independent medical publications (source:       SCOPUS search &lt; DRAQ5&gt;) providing evidence of the role of DRAQ5&#8482; in       improving different clinical assays as a generic probe but for multiple       cell types - typical examples being: DRAQ5&#8482; permitting the optimization of       multi-colour approaches for the clinical analysis of cancer cells, DRAQ5&#8482;       increasing the speed of assays by allowing single-step processing of       clinical samples such as bone marrow aspirates, DRAQ5&#8482; simplifying assays       by allowing nucleated cells to be identified in blood and bone marrow       samples.
Further DRAQ5&#8482; introduces a new cell descriptor to enhance       accuracy of diagnosis in lymphoproliferative disorders and plasma cell       neoplasias.
DRAQ5&#8482; enables for the first time the simple extraction of       proliferation index of specific bone marrow cell compartments - an       important feature linked to patient outcomes.
The core technology also       encompasses new derivatives.
For example DRAQ7 detects cell viability and       is to be supplied in 2013 as a validated probe5.10 by Beckman       Coulter Inc - a leading in vitro diagnostics flow cytometry company.
DRAQ7       is being evaluated further for an improved version of the ISHAGE protocol       for Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria diagnostics and for the       standardization of flow cytometry for myelodysplastic syndromes.
