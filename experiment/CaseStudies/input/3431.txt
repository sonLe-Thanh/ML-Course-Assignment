     Media professionals     Media professionals, authors, museum professionals, scholars and       educationists were involved in       the research from the outset, and were active members of the project       advisory board.
The CEOs of       three independent television production companies, Flashback Productions,       Testimony Films and       Wall to Wall, who specialise in making Military and Archive, Oral History       and `Reality' and       Genealogy historical programmes, were all active participants in the       project's Advisory Board.
They also contributed to the two main conferences associated with the       project (2008 and 2009).
These conferences brought media professionals and academics (media       scholars and historians)       together to debate key issues in the mediation of the past on television       and gave them a valued       opportunity to reflect on their practice.
For example, an independent       producer wrote that:       `I found the conference, and the advisory panel discussions, hugely         stimulating.
Turning out         programmes to meet the demands of micro-managing commissioning editors         doesn't give one         much opportunity to reflect on historiography but Lincoln and the         preparation for it did.

(CT.2013);       another added, `In the hectic, often full-on         schedule of television production there is rarely enough time to stop         and think about what one is         doing.
The advisory panel meetings were an excellent opportunity to do         just that....There were         excellent discussions about different aspects of television history that         were new to me'       (TD.10.7.13).
Another media professional emphasised the value of the research and in       particular, its       engagement with members of the industry and observed that academic       researchers rarely did this:       `[this research] has helped me understand how our work fitted more         widely into the spectrum of         public history narratives available on television' (AG.21.10.13).
The research also produced tools that enabled producers to analyse their       products and consider       their content.
A number of producers acknowledged the value of the       concepts explored in the       research and the insights it provided (AG 21.10.13).
One producer observed       that the research had       `forced us to continue to interrogate our methodology and our purposes,         ensuring not only that our         programmes continue to entertain large numbers of people but that they         also seek to properly and         responsibly inform and educate our audiences about their history and         those of the people around         them; working with Ann and Erin it soon became obvious that what we were         doing was a form of         public history (AG 21.10.13).
Following publication of History         on Television, Taylor Downing,       (Flashback) noted that: `Television producers are notoriously bad at         reading academic critiques of         what they do.
But they would be well advised to read the Gray-Bell book'       (TD 10.7.13); Steve       Humphries (Testimony Films) added: `For me it is the best analysis of         history programme making         in Britain that has ever been produced.
On this basis I have recommended         it to friends and         colleagues'.
(SH 17.6.13).
This reception shows that our research       has permeated the professional       community causing them to reflect on their practices, and that the impact       of the research is       continuing to grow amongst the professional community.
European Context     Whilst the project focused on UK television productions, our preliminary       research attracted interest       from scholars in other parts of Europe who were pursuing similar but       isolated forms of research.
This was reflected in participants in a symposium organized at Lincoln,       `Televising the History: the       past(s) on the small screen' (Lincoln 2005), which resulted in a journal       special issue and an edited       collection.
Our research was picked up by Professor Pierre Sorlin's project for       Assemblea Legislativa della       Regione Emilia-Romagna `For a European TV History'.
We produced two       reports on UK television       history programmes for their symposia `Audio Visual Media and European       Community Culture' and       `For a European TV History', Bologna, 2008 and 2009.
We challenged the       conservative tendency       of their project to emphasise traditional forms of documentary.
Our final       research report, which       argued for the value and importance of popular forms of history       programming, was included in the       Tanti passati per un futuro comune?
La storia in televisione nei paesi         dell'Unione europea 2011       report by Pierre Sorlin (Sorbonne).
Sorlin and the other contributors,       including Gray and Bell, were       invited to present to the European Parliament in Brussels in December 2011       by Salvatore       Caronna, a leading Italian MEP.
Attendees included politicians and media       professionals: Caronna,       an MEP and representative of the Partito Democratico; Dario Carella,       vice-director of the regional       news section of the Italian broadcaster RAI; Juan Fernando Lopez Aguilar,       MEP and president of       the commission on civil liberties, justice and internal affairs; Marc       Tarabella, MEP; Anna Colombo       General Secretary of the Social Democratic Group of the European       Parliament; and Sorlin.
Such       interest in this research points to its potential wider impact upon       politicians as well as scholars and       media professionals.
One of the MEPs and an Italian news site reported on       the event on-line.
