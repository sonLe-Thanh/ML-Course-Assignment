     CENTRIM's research expertise in the area of peer-to-peer learning       networks has been mobilised to develop the following programmes of the       Profitnet learning network:            The `standard' Profitnet programme focuses mainly on the peer-to-peer         support facilitated by specially trained facilitators and complemented         by input from experts on topics of interest to the involved small         businesses (860 participating small firms in UK, Ireland and South         Africa)       The Profitnet Plus programme, which combines the peer-to-peer support         with the intervention of a specially trained `coach' to support         innovation (222 SMEs in UK and Ireland)       The Profitnet Buddy programme of one-to-one mentoring from one small         business to another in parallel with the group sessions (38 SMEs in UK)       The Profitnet New Product Development programme, which combines the         peer-to-peer support with training and structured support for the         development of new products (piloted with six SMEs).
The programme has also required the training and support of facilitators       and project managers to operate 60 groups with 741 small businesses in       Sussex (2004-13), ten groups with 202 small businesses in Ireland       (2004-13) and 14 groups with 173 small businesses in South Africa       (2007-10).
More than 250 people around the world have been trained to       enable the delivery of the programme, including 200 facilitators, 15       project managers and 40 innovation consultants.
The Profitnet programme has grown through three phases.
In the Pilot         phase, between 2003 and 2005, the University, at the bequest of the       Regional Development Agency (SEEDA), converted academic knowledge around       peer-to-peer learning into specific operations and processes of learning       networks in Hastings.
The Validation phase, 2006 and 2009, in which the tools,       methodologies and training programmes from the pilot phase were improved       to support the active engagement of 370 small Sussex-based companies in 31       learning networks in sectors including manufacturing, creative industries,       construction, tourism, professional services and social enterprises.
At       the same time, a pilot programme was set up in Ireland (63 SMEs in 5       networks) and South Africa (55 SMEs in 5 networks).
An internal survey of       195 companies in the Sussex programme (53% of all members at this stage)       confirmed the influence of the programme after 2009: in some cases the       fortune of products was turned around from 10% decline per annum to 20%       increase year-on-year for three years (source 5.1).
The survey also showed       large increases in the level of interactions with external parties: 58% of       Profitnet members increased interactions with customers, 44% with       suppliers and 38% with support organisations and 42% with higher education       (HE).
The financial results of members were compared with the financial       data of small firms in Sussex received from The Chamber of Commerce for       Sussex.
Between April 2007 and April 2008, the Profitnet companies       exhibited 9% increase of profit before tax against a drop of 15.2% for the       local SMEs; they also had an 18.7% increase of turnover compared with 3.2%       increase for local SMEs.
The Professionalisation phase, from 2009 to 2013, in which fees       were introduced for the participants and the programme activities were       fully codified (activities converted into manuals, tools and operational       guidelines).
A total of 552 SMEs participated in 38 networks during this       phase: 295 SMEs (22 networks) from Sussex, 139 SMEs (7 networks) from       Donegal in Ireland and 118 SMEs (9 networks) from Durban in South Africa.
A series of evaluation studies (an internal survey of 96 participants)       (5.2, 5.3) showed a clear impact for the Sussex-based SMEs on a number of       areas:            93% of the surveyed members acknowledged improvements to their         strategy skills while Cormode (5.2) demonstrated participants learning         the value of planning in contrast to dealing with issues in a         `fire-fighting' mode and showed how members gained the confidence to         move to the exploration of new development avenues (5.3).
85% of the surveyed members improved their problem-solving skills;         typical examples are learning to delegate problem-solving power to         employees (5.4, 5.5) and learning how to develop key performance         indicators to monitor operations (5.4).
78% of the surveyed members acknowledged impact on marketing, such as         learning new ways to exploit existing business offerings (5.3) and         acquiring the skills to differentiate between strong lead customers and         customers with weak interest (5.5).
Firms learned about e-commerce systems; in some cases this resulted in         expanding e-sales from 20% of turnover to over 40% (5.1).
The Profitnet programme has made unique contributions towards the smaller       businesses helping them to `weather the recession' (5.6).
These       contributions were corroborated by a number of statements received from       participating small businesses.
These corroborating statements came from a       variety of small businesses that include a high-growth start-up (5.5), a       high-tech/high-growth small firm (5.7), a micro business (5.8), a small       business (5.1) and a medium-sized social enterprise (5.4).
Profitnet has introduced peer-to-peer learning in a variety of economic       environments and a number of the participating companies have adopted the       practice of peer-to-peer learning to such an extent that they have set up       their own independent peer-to-peer learning schemes.
The participants (especially the micros and small businesses) indicated       that the programme has enabled them to become familiar with innovation       management strategies and techniques.
Participation has allowed them to       understand the managerial requirements necessary for the development of a       new product (5.4) and ways of addressing different kinds of customer value       (5.7).
Furthermore, the peer support acted for some participants as a       unique way of confidence building in order to practise innovation,       providing the checks and balances for new or risky ventures (5.7, 5.8).
The high reputation of the programme has led to a number of references in       the local and the national press.
In January 2009, the UK Secretary of       State for Innovation, Universities and Skills mentioned the Profitnet       programme in the House of Commons as an exemplar programme for supporting       small businesses.
It was also featured in the government-commissioned       `Wilson Report' (2012) in which it is held up as an exemplar in the field       of `structured networking' that `connect businesses to universities'       (5.9).
Profitnet has also successfully introduced the concept of       innovation and innovation management process to mainstream SMEs that       initially viewed Innovation Management as something only for businesses       with advanced technology or for large enterprises.'
