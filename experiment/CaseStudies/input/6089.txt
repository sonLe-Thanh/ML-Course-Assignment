     Reliability of high voltage electrical insulators is of paramount concern       to the electricity generation, transmission and distribution industries as       failure of electrical equipment due to breakdown of the HV insulation       leads to power outages (blackouts).
The electricity industry needs to       satisfy the demands of the Regulator (Ofgem) in terms of security of       supply.
Failure of HV power equipment, such as high voltage power cables       capable of transporting all the power from a large power station (cost       &#163;0.3M per km), high voltage power transformers (cost &#163;2-5M each), bushings       and switchgear insulation, has significant financial penalties for the       industry in terms of repair costs and fines imposed by the Regulator.
These costs will ultimately have to be borne by UK business and domestic       consumers in the form of increased energy costs [A].
The stakes are       high: the typical cost of a 2GW HVDC link is of the order of &#163;1         Billion and the cost of failure can result in loss of ~&#163;1M revenue per         day due to lost electricity transmission alone.
2GW also represents       a significant fraction of the UK's generation capacity (~70GW) and could       potentially cause power to be redirected through an already congested AC       transmission network reducing network security.
Reliability of electrical       insulation is of major concern not only to electricity suppliers but also       to HV equipment manufacturers whose products must be warranted against       defects and failure over a 40-year operating time.
The R&amp;D Specialist,       National Grid, states "This research has provided the fundamental         basis for many asset management decisions related to electricity         transmission assets.
The typical failure mechanism for high voltage         assets is failure of the insulation and although not a frequent event,         when it does happen is catastrophic leading to potential loss of supply,         replacement of major assets and therefore increased costs (a single         transformer for instance costs &#163;2M-&#163;5M).
This research has provided         knowledge on both the mechanisms but also on the potential for         monitoring the health of the assets" [A].
The research at Leicester on nanocomposites has informed industry in       terms of new and improved electrical power products, research and       development as evidenced by Leicester's contribution to "Polymer         Nanocomposites: Fundamentals and Possible Applications to Power Sectors"       published by CIGR&#201;.
(International Council on Large Electric Systems).
CIGR&#201; is one of the leading worldwide organizations on electric power       systems, covering their technical, economic, environmental, organisational       and regulatory aspects with aims to "facilitate the exchange of       information between engineering personnel and specialists in all       countries, to develop knowledge in power systems and to add value to the       knowledge and information exchanged by synthesizing state-of-the-art world       practices".
The Senior Scientist at Hydro-Qu&#233;bec Research Institute,       states "The work of Fothergill and Nelson carried out in Leicester         2002-2004, on the electrical properties of nanodielectrics was the first         experimental work designed to relate the presence of nano-sized         additives in a polymer with its impact on dielectric properties.
This         work showed improved electrical performance of nanodielectrics over         conventional microcomposite polymeric systems.
These results have had a         significant technical contribution to the CIGRE report on `Polymer         Nanocomposites: Fundamentals and Possible Applications to Power Sectors'         which was first published in 2011, particularly the chapters in the         report relating to electrical and space charge properties" [B].
This document has substantial reach by demonstrating how nanocomposites       could and are being usefully used by manufacturers and end users in the       following HV systems: switchgear, DC power cables, enamelled wires,       rotating machines, capacitors, all solid insulated substations, outdoor       insulation and power electronics.
Polymers are the preferred choice for electrical insulation in electrical       power cables and other HV power applications such as transformer bushings,       cable terminations etc., as used on the electrical power transmission       grid.
The promise of improved electrical properties of polymeric based       nanocomposites, as first shown experimentally at Leicester, has       been embraced by a number of polymer manufacturers who supply the raw       materials for insulation components.
Borealis is probably the largest       materials producer for polymers for the high voltage insulation industry       in the world.
They have been supporting many projects in the development       of the incorporation of nanoparticles into their materials "both in       internal projects and in external networks" [C].
Similarly, ABB       have also invested in nanocomposite technology for their electrical       insulation components [D].
Evonik Industries manufacture a range of       epoxy based nanocomposite materials as master batches that are especially       designed for electrical and electronic applications [E].
Similar       products have been introduced for improved performance from manufacturers       such as PMT Prepreg Resin systems and 3M.
"The Liu work project         [G.4][6] had a clear impact as it demonstrated the use of dielectric         spectroscopy as a tool for characterisation of insulating material.
We         (Borealis) have then proceeded to use Novocontrol equipment at Chalmers         University in Gothenburg in order to solve various problems.
The project         gave also valuable knowledge in measurement techniques, knowledge that         was utilised when setting up our system for tan delta measurement of         medium voltage cables", Technical Manager, Borealis [C].
Leicester's recent involvement in a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP),       2011-12, led to the creation of a new &#163;1M HVDC cable test facility at       Alstom Grid in the UK [F].
Alstom are a well-established       engineering company who manufacture state-of-the-art HVDC converters for       HVDC transmission systems.
A DC transmission system offers a flexible and       efficient means of electrical power transmission and represents a new       international market for their products.
This world-leading and unique       long-term HVDC cable ageing evaluation centre, opened in 2012, combines       three online measurement probes to characterise the electrical properties       of commercial size 200kV cables whilst undergoing an industry standard       programme of thermo-electrical ageing.
This has raised Alstom's       international profile as suppliers of HVDC systems and attracted       considerable international interest from manufacturers and end users, such       as National Grid, leveraged the establishment of industrial partnerships       with international cable manufacturers such as Nexans (France) and Viscas       (Japan) who have provided in-kind investment of &#163;0.5M and each company has       installed cables for long term ageing tests.
The innivation has enhanced       Alstom's profile as a world leader in HVDC technology and has enabled it       to compete on the international stage with other HVDC technology       suppliers, such as ABB and Siemens, who offer established turnkey       solutions.
"We are very keen for your research group to continue to       support this key project to back-up the on-going work in Stafford to help       us analyse and understand key ground breaking work associated with       space-charge measurements in HVDC cables systems under VSC type converter       stresses in years to come.
The expertise that your research group is         able to provide our company with is very unique within the industry and         has proven to produce real impacts".
Managing Director, ALSTOM Grid       Research &amp; Technology Centre [F].
