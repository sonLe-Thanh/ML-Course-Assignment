     The new research has had impacts in the detection of food contaminants.
As ready meals       containing meat have become more popular (now estimated at 5% of the UK       food budget), the       potential for fraudulent food labelling has increased.
The potential for       mislabelling came to the fore       in 2009 and again in 2013.
The Food and Environment Research Agency       (Fera), part of DEFRA,       guides the science evidence base in the food and environment sectors to       ensure that UK policy-makers  	  are well informed, undertaking both surveillance and research and       development activities.
Its services underpin regulatory frameworks as well as supporting       religious and cultural factors       such as food provenance (e.g.
halal or kosher).
Fera was member of the European SAfe FEED-Processed Animal Proteins       (SAFEED-PAP),       alongside our NERC CONNECT B partner, Stephen Woodgate, then of Prosper De       Mulder Ltd       (PDM) and Technical Director of the European Fat Processing and Renderers       Association.
Our       findings that collagen was thermally stable and that animal origin could       be identified by a peptide       fingerprint were reported by Woodgate to the SAFEED-PAP team and Collins       was invited to       become an advisor to the project.
Working with Fera scientists we       demonstrated that ZooMS was       able to discriminate (thermally treated) meat and bone meal particles.
Dr       Vincent Baeten,       coordinator of SAFEED-PAP and Head of the Food and Feed Unit for the EU       Reference       Laboratory, applauded "...the innovative analytical solution that the         Department has proposed for         detection of animal bone, using protein mass-spectrometry...[and] the         effort made...to adapt this         method coming from archaeology to feed safety..."b.     Collins was subsequently invited by Fera to apply the technique within a       Food Standards Agency       (FSA) investigation into the suspected use of pig and cow-derived gelatin       (so-called plumping       agents) used to re-hydrate air-freighted chicken meat.
ZooMS confirmed       that the FSA's suspicions       were correct.
The results of the investigation were broadcast on 14 July 2009 to an       estimated audience of 5       million (What's really in our food?)c.
Dr Shuja Shafi of       the Muslim Council of Britain stated that       Muslims would be extremely annoyed and extremely distressed to learn that       chicken sold as halal       contains protein from prohibited species and they would be extremely angry       if this turned out to be       a deliberate deception as Muslims rely heavily on accurate food labelling       (minutes 53 - 55 of       programmec).
The discovery of the fraud was widely publicised       in the UK press and reported in the       Annual Report of the Chief Scientist of the FSAd.
Secretary       general of the Hindu Forum of Britain,       Bharti Tailor, was quoted on 04/06/2009 as saying "Eating beef is         expressly forbidden because         cows are considered to be sacred as they are a representation of the         bounty of the gods, even         unknowingly.
The fact that the protein powders injected into chickens         served in restaurants and         cafes contain even traces of beef or pork is horrific"c.     As a direct consequence of the investigation, food industry suppliers in       Spain, Germany and the       Netherlands were inspected and the largest supplier of poultry to the       Asian market in the UK (Euro       Foods Group) changed their practices.
An announcement on their website       (consulted July 2009)       stated that in order to 'eradicate any future question marks and/or         confusion over non-chicken         protein detection levels in our product range, Euro Foods Group has         decided to switch to a         vegetable derived protein instead, a move which was completed by 29th         June 2009', (see also       minutes 51-52 of programme in reference 2).
Due to the sensitive nature of       the issue we do not       know the full impact of our work.
We signed a license agreement with Fera in 2011 giving them commercial       access to our collagen       databases for use in the future forensic work for a fee of 5% of income       generation.
In a DEFRA-       funded study (&#163;91k contract, 01/03/11 to 31/03/12), they validated the       technique and found it to be       superior to commercially-available immunochemical and DNA based assays       (Grundy et al.
submitted).
The impact of this research extends internationally through the Fera       contract, which included an       inter-laboratory trial, during which the analytical method was       successfully transferred to alternative       food enforcement laboratories in Europe and North America (including the       US FDA).
York provided       training in the methodology, species-specific marker peptide sequences and       data assessment from       these trials, our choice of mammoth gelatin as the positive control (CBC       News: Jan 03, 2011), was       in recognition of the archaeological origins of the method.
A further       DEFRA-funded project       (FA0126) is transferring the method to other food matrices for Fera       customers to screen foods       destined for the Halal markets, products such as gelatin capsules (for       therapeutic/supplement       formulations) aimed at vegetarian customers and in the wake of the 2013       controversy, horse.
This       research therefore has impact on public and commercial servicese       as well as public debate.
Writing about the impact of the team's relationship with       FERA, Adrian Charlton, Head of Chemical       and Biochemical Profiling at FERA, wrote: "...FERA's close         collaboration with Professors Thomas-Oates         and Collins has led to a number of technologies that we routinely         exploit to deliver ongoing         project work and to underpin project proposals, papers and publicity         material.
In particular, we         have undertaken a number of studies to determine peptide sequences that         can be used for the         species origin determination in collaboration with you and your         colleagues.
These projects have led         to Fera offering an international service for the         species identification of gelatin and Meat and         Bone Meal in food and feed, respectively...".
