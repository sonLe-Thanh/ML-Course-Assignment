     The research described above has impacted the development of UK       Government oral health policy including workforce and dental service       planning, oral health promotion and dental education.
Understanding how       the oral health of the population has changed and will change in the       future through the UK Dental Health Surveys is "pivotal to the           planning of oral health services" (e1).
1.
Informing Government policy on dental health: 2005 onwards     Access to dentists is an area that motivates public opinion and the ADHS       findings have led directly to strategic policy decisions by the UK       Government on the distribution of dentists in order to match oral health       needs.
Published by the Department of Health in 2005, the last National         Oral Health Strategy (still current) drew upon evidence from the UK       Dental Health Surveys to outline measures by which improvements needed to       be made to dental services to enable good oral health and reduce oral       health inequalities across all age groups in England (e2).
While       many of the key action points have been implemented, an independent review       of dentistry published in 2009 (e3), drawing upon evidence from       the recent UK Dental Health Surveys, indicated that "The trends in           disease prevalence and the way it has been managed are visible in the           oral health of different generations.
We still need to deal with this           burden of the past...".
Various recommendations for the improvement of NHS dental services are       now being acted upon and are reflected in the Coalition Government's 2010       white paper `Healthy Lives, Healthy People: Our strategy for public health       in England' (e4): "The dental public health workforce will           increase its focus on effective health promotion and prevention of           oral disease...[ ].
It will also make a vital contribution to           implementation of a new contract for primary care dentistry, which the           Government is to introduce to increase emphasis on prevention while           meeting patients' treatment needs more effectively".

Improvements to provision of dental services: 2006 onwards     Alterations to dental services and the dental contract models adopted       within the NHS are influenced, and monitored over time, by the results of       the Dental Health Surveys, with the Department of Health outlining in       2010: "The latest surveys of the oral health of adults and children           show that about two-thirds are free of visible tooth decay.
People           want a dental service that helps them to prevent oral health problems           and maintain good oral health.
[ ] Until now, the NHS dentistry           contract has remained focused on treatment; there has been little or           no incentive for dentists to practise the sort of preventative           dentistry that most people today want and need.
It is time for this to           change."
(e5).
The new dental contracts piloted (2011-3) aim to deliver the Government's       commitment of increasing access to dental services and improving oral       health and represents a fundamental reform of NHS dentistry.
"In           moving to a capitation and quality model, we are therefore proposing a           completely new way of remunerating dentists for the clinical care they           deliver.
We are building on the lessons of the past" (e5).
The new pilot contracts are working under a full capitation scheme with       payments for quality and clinical outcomes using quality measures first       suggested by the Birmingham team's PDS evaluation findings.
The General       Dental Services contract was first introduced in 1948, changed in 1990 and       again in 2006.
The new dental contracts would only be the 3rd       change since the inception of the NHS.

Government Workforce Planning: 2004 onwards     The impact of the Birmingham research in monitoring and identifying       trends in population oral health is continuing to inform government       workforce planning.
Higher Education undergraduate dental training numbers       are set by government on the basis of workforce needs and the Office of       Fair Trading wishes to see open and fair competition for dental services.
In the last decade, the UK dental health surveys highlighted the       difficulties people experienced identifying an NHS dentist and it was       generally assumed that this was due to a shortage of dentists.
To address       this, and specific geographical needs, in 2004 the Government agreed to a       25% expansion in dental training in England and approved the establishment       of two new dental schools in the SW Peninsula and Central Lancashire.
Due       to the long lead time (5 years to train a dentist), this expansion       programme of the NHS workforce, aimed at improving access to local dental       services and oral health, began to have an impact only in 2010 (Review of       Medical and Dental School Intakes in England, 2012).
More recently, the 2009 ADHS demonstrated that there had been a       considerable shift in demographics and the way in which people access       dental services, with access to services and standards of general oral       health in lower socioeconomic groups still remaining a challenge.
Reflecting these findings, the 2010 Government policy on workforce       planning (e6) outlined a vision: "The NHS commissions to           improve the oral health and well-being of the population, to reduce           oral health inequalities and to make oral health services available           for all and tailored to meet the needs of each individual".
Subsequently, in 2013, Medical Education in England reviewed the dental       skill mix, which includes Dental Care Professionals (DCPs) such as nurses,       therapists and dental technicians, and recommended "that the           Government consider how DCPs can make a greater contribution to           outreach services to adults and children in the lowest socio-economic           groups."

Oral Health Strategy across the UK: addressing oral health           inequalities     One of the most significant findings to emerge from the recent UK Dental       Health Surveys was the issue of inequalities of oral health.
Oral health       inequalities are recognised as a major public health challenge because       lower income and socially disadvantaged groups experience       disproportionately higher levels of oral disease.
In response to these       findings, oral health policy has shifted to targeting vulnerable groups.
For example, in Scotland, the government is implementing a strategy which       targets oral health for frail older individuals, people with special care       needs and those who are homeless (e8).
Also, at the BDA conference       in April 2013, the Department of Health Minister, Earl Howe quoted       findings from the ADHS 2009 and announced the formation of a dental task       group to determine how to improve dental services for vulnerable patients       and individuals who are not accessing care.
At a local level, implementation of the Government's strategy for oral       health is the responsibility of local NHS Trusts, which publish their       local oral health strategy on a 5-year cycle.
These local strategies (for         example e9) are written against a backdrop of the 2009 ADHS findings       of oral health inequalities and a need to ensure equitable access to       dental services for all.
For example, the Isle of Man dental services are       considering adopting the protocol of the 2009 Adult Dental Health Survey       to improve and inform a health needs assessment of adult residents (e10).
The UK Dental Health Surveys have started to provide the international       dental community with robust and rich epidemiological data resulting in an       evidence-base for influencing international oral health policies (as       reported at leading global conferences, eg e11).
