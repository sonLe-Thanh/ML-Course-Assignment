     The original research (Output One) was published by the Nuffield       Foundation in November 2006 and was widely disseminated among       practitioners, policy-makers and interest groups.
It was also made freely       available on the internet (Corroborating Source 3).
The findings       were presented to user audiences via events including a one-day conference       held at the Nuffield Foundation at which key stakeholders, such as the Law       Commission and the Law Society, were in attendance.
The research has impacted upon public policy in two main ways.
Firstly,       because the project fitted directly into an ongoing process of review of       the law relating to cohabitation breakdown, it proved immediately       influential, being repeatedly cited by the Law Commission in its 2007       Report on Cohabitation, and informing its decision to recommend reform of       the law (Corroborating Source 4: pp.
11, 70, 71, 193 and 198).
The       endorsement of the researchers' work within those proposals meant that the       research evidence generated was able to stimulate and inform policy debate       around the issue of cohabitation and matrimonial property.
Furthermore,       the need for reform, and the Law Commission's 2007 recommendations, were       also cited by the Supreme Court in the cases of Kernott v Jones       [2011] UKSC 53, and Gow v Grant [2012] UKSC 29.
Despite this       judicial support, the Government announced in September 2011 that no       reform would be forthcoming in this Parliament.
In addition, the Court of Appeal in the 2009 decision of Radmacher v         Granatino utilised the research findings to evaluate arguments about       the basis on which decisions about the redistribution of property after       the breakdown of marriage should be made and the relevance of prenuptial       agreements (Corroborating Source 5, paragraph 8).
Moreover, when       dealing with the existence of a European matrimonial regime in English       financial provision proceedings, Mr Justice Mostyn, the judge in B v S         (Financial Remedy: Marital Property Regime) [2012] EWHC 265 (Fam),       drew extensively upon the findings from the research concerning the       application of the regime in its home jurisdiction (Corroborating         Source 6, paragraphs 5-11).
Together, this evidence demonstrates the       considerable scope of the impact of the research in informing judicial       decisions which not only rule upon the individual case being heard, but       also provide direction for subsequent exercise of judicial discretion in       deciding how financial provision orders should be made.
The relevance of       the research is particularly acute where English judges are faced with       agreements drawn up in other jurisdictions.
The second principal impact of this research occurred subsequent to       Professor Cooke's appointment to the Law Commission, in May 2008, when its       findings proved to be instrumental in the development of the Commission's       Consultation Paper on Matrimonial Property Regimes (Corroborating         Source 2).
This used the research to inform a discussion of the       potential for a qualifying prenuptial agreement, and to analyse reform in       England and Wales in the light of the law in neighbouring European       countries.
Although uncited (due to Law Commission convention), Chapter 4       of the Law Commission document clearly draws heavily upon the comparative       basis of the research (the only relevant study), and the issues raised by       qualifying prenuptial agreements in Chapters 5 and 6 are evidently       informed by the findings from the empirical work carried out in the       comparator jurisdictions.
As the responsible Law Commissioner, Cooke is directly responsible for       the reform recommendations that will follow the Consultation (discussed in       Corroborating Source 7) and is well-positioned to implement policy       change based on the research findings; the intimacy of this connection       between research and policymaking illustrates the considerable       significance and depth of the project's impact.
Callus served as a member       of the Law Commission's Advisory Board for the project and also submitted       a response to the consultation process (drawing on the earlier research).
This particularly focused on public support for the notion that the family       home should always be shared equally, irrespective of legal title or       contributions, thereby providing an additional pathway for the research       into the policy field (Corroborating Source 8).
The Law Commission Report that follows the 2011 Consultation Paper will,       in due course, propose draft legislation to implement any recommended       reforms.
This is an ongoing process; the Law Commission published a       Supplementary Consultation Paper in September 2012 (Corroborating         Source 9), and is set to report on all aspects of matrimonial       property in late 2013/early 2014.
Both researchers remain heavily involved       in this process; Cooke as Law Commissioner and Callus via a working paper       submitted to the consultation process (Corroborating Source 10),       which the Law Commission expressly relied upon to inform discussion on how       English law on financial provision can be reformed (Corroborating         Source 9, p51).
This constitutes a very significant influence on       policy made by government and quasi-government bodies, and it is unlikely       that the reform process or the direction of policy travel in this area       would be as it is but for the influence of Cooke and Callus' work.
