     Our research has underpinned recommendations for the development of       services for the clinical management of patients with gastrointestinal       disorders in the UK and Europe; and the greater use of nurses rather than       doctors to perform endoscopy in the UK and the USA.
Publication in 2000 of       the results of our trial comparing appointment-based follow-up with open       access to clinical advice prompted the national development of nurse-led       open-access services for IBD and other diseases [C1].
The BSG used our       evidence: in guidelines for the management of IBD published in 2004; in a       national strategy for gastrointestinal services published in 2007 [C2];       and in National Service Standards for IBD, first published in 2009 [C3],       which recommend the appointment of specialist nurses, development of open       access services, and closer monitoring of patient outcomes.
National audits of the management of patients with IBD have shown the       impact of our underpinning research on the delivery of patient care.
Under       a multi-professional steering group, the Clinical Effectiveness and       Evaluation unit (CEEu) of the Royal College of Physicians conducted three       UK-wide audits of the development of services for patients with       gastroenterological disorders and the quality of patient care between 2006       and 2010.
The successive response rates to these audits were 75%, 93% and       90% of hospitals in the UK.
By 2010 most hospitals were employing       specialist nurses and offering open access to patients with IBD.
The Table       compares the findings of the three audits [C4] and shows substantial       improvements in services offered to patients, both in the community and       when admitted to hospital:     Table: Results from         sequential UK national audits of IBD care                                Measure           2006           2008           2010                             Percentage of UK hospital sites offering open access             &#8211; using data from 128 hospital sites participating in all 3 audits           63%           67%           94%                             Percentage of UK hospital sites supporting telephone             helpline &#8211; using data from 128 hospital sites in all 3 audits           76%           85%           95%                             Percentage of admitted IBD patients reviewed by             specialist nurse on ward (number of patients audited in each round)           21% (697)           27% (890)           42% (1375)                          Our evidence that nurse endoscopists are more thorough than doctors and       generate more patient satisfaction, but achieve similar clinical outcomes       at similar costs, underpins recommendations for nurse endoscopy in both       the UK [C5] (analysis based almost exclusively on our study) and the USA       [C6] (by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, who found no       similar study in the USA).
To quote the NHS Centre for Reviews and       Dissemination [C5]:     "This trial was funded and designed to provide evidence to support         decision-making in the NHS.
The participants and procedures reflect         those of a range of NHS hospitals at the time of the trial (2002-3).
Hence the findings are likely to be generalisable ...
The trial was well         conducted and the authors' conclusions are likely to be reliable."
In the UK, recruitment of nurse endoscopists has steadily expanded: fewer       than 20% of hospitals employed nurse endoscopists when we started the       MINuET study in 2002; by 2011 this had risen to 85% [C5].
In 2011 a Royal       College of Nursing audit [C7] showed that the number of specialist nurses       was rising, with 54% in post less than 5 years.
99% of specialist nurses       ran a telephone help-line for patients; 72% ran open access clinics; and       21% regularly undertook endoscopy.
A UK-wide audit of colonoscopy reported       that nurses performed 11% of colonoscopies in 2011, whereas doctors       performed 100% in 2001 [C8].
The findings from our analyses of routine data contributed to UK       recommendations from the BSG and Royal College of Physicians for services       out of hours for patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and wider       thinking on the provision of hospital services out of hours.
The director       of medical workforce at the Royal College of Physicians observed [C9]:     "This study provides yet more evidence that patients in hospital are         not cared for well at weekends, and reinforces the call from the RCP for         consultant physicians caring for very sick patients to be in the         hospital for 12 hours a day, every day, including weekends."
Our exploration of outcomes following emergency and elective admission to       hospital with inflammatory bowel disease stimulated a Europe-wide debate       on the timing of surgery for severe colitis, particularly with the       emergence of new medical treatments that may influence the need for this.
In 2012 the European Crohns &amp; Colitis Organisation cited our study of       emergency admissions for ulcerative colitis when recommending a       consensus-based therapeutic approach to optimise the timing of surgery       [C10].
We conclude that our distinctive research programme has achieved       significant impact, engendering modernisation of services through policy       initiatives from professional societies; development of extended nursing       roles, now contributing significantly to endoscopy services and the care       of patients with inflammatory bowel disease; increasing patient-focused       care in IBD, as documented in three successive national audits from 2006       to 2010; and recommendations to improve hospital services out of hours,       especially in endoscopy.
This impact has been wide in reach, stimulating       the development of open-access services for patients with IBD and       out-of-hours endoscopy across the UK; increasing numbers of nurse       endoscopists across the UK; recommendations for non-physician endoscopists       in the USA; and more aggressive treatment of acute severe colitis in       Europe.
