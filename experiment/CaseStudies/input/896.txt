     Nestl&#233;'s research programme into the bioavailability and metabolism of       coffee-derived phenolic compounds was established to back up the       `functional' claims of new and existing functional foods, specifically its       Green Blend coffee.
This has led to impact on the industry in terms of: investment       in research and development; adoption of new technology and         processes to produce this new coffee; commercialisation of the         new product.
Scientific support for marketing claims     The research to elucidate the bioavailability of phenolic conjugates from       coffee has provided a strong scientific basis from which Nestl&#233; has been       able to submit marketing authorisations for its Green Blend `functional'       coffee brand, in many jurisdictions and countries worldwide.
Although each       country has its own rules about the evidence required to support       functional claims, the UoL research has underpinned marketing       applications, allowing Nestl&#233; to sell Green Blend as a functional product       or one high in antioxidants, and this was patented in 2010 [A].
In Australia, for example, the Green Blend label claims that the product       "delivers 70% more antioxidants than green tea" [B].
This claim is backed       up by Williamson's review (Section 3, Ref 4) of the       bioavailability of different antioxidants in coffee and tea.
Williamson also played a key role during the UK launch of Green       Blend and he is quoted in the launch press release [C].
The launch       emphasised the scientific evidence on the antioxidant benefits from the       product.
Williamson provided a scientific expert's perspective on       the brand's health claims; he was also able to explain the issues of       bioavailability and present key research findings on Green Blend (and its       comparison with green tea and other foods) to journalists at the Green       Blend launch event in London in 2009.
He was quoted widely in articles       about the product and he participated in radio interviews and discussions       [D].
Further impact within Nestl&#233;     A statement from Nestl&#233; notes that "the contribution... has greatly       underpinned and strengthened Nestl&#233;'s post-launch position of a successful       new coffee product (Nescaf&#233; Green Blend) currently with global sales of       hundreds of millions of pounds per year" [E].
Among the benefits to the       company, Nestl&#233; says the research has:            re-enforced positive messages on coffee and health in the coffee         market       contributed to the claims for the antioxidant and polyphenol content         of the products being sold being widely accepted       helped Nestl&#233;'s marketing teams to use this to their advantage and         "..had a very clear and positive impact on this business"       allowed the company to run workshops and meetings on Green Blend with         key opinion leaders to present and explain the positive effects on         health.
In 2011 Williamson's work was compiled along with output from       other research groups into a confidential dossier that catalogued all the       research carried out by the Nestl&#233; Research Center, Williamson's       group in UoA6 at the UoL and other institutions into the absorption,       metabolism and bioavailability of antioxidant compounds in coffee,       specifically Green Blend [F].
This dossier provides Nestl&#233; with a       comprehensive evidence base for existing and potential claims about the       health benefits of its Green Blend coffee, specifically the delivery of       antioxidants to the body from the drink, as highlighted in the Australian       market.
The high antioxidant levels and bioavailability claims derived from the       UoA6 research are at the core of Green Blend's positioning in the market.
Nestl&#233; has even patent protected the marketing and sales processes which       emphasise bioavailability [A].
The UoA6 research is central to the patent       and Williamson is one of the named inventors.
This patent       demonstrates the extent to which the UoA6 research is driving Green Blend       marketing, its competitive positioning and its differentiation in the       market.
Sales growth     Nestl&#233; will not publically release sales figures from individual       products.
However, Green Blend is currently sold in many countries       worldwide and has global sales estimated at hundreds of millions of pounds       per year.
Analysis by a finance journalist for Reuters noted that Nestl&#233;'s       2009 performance [G] "was boosted by strong growth from its coffees like       Dolce Gusto and Green Blend."
The successful performance of Green Blend       was confirmed by the Head of Investor Relations at Nestl&#233; S.A. in a first       quarter sales conference call in 2010 [H].
