     Linking the research to impact       Raman thermography technology developed at Bristol was made available to       UK, European, US and Asian companies to characterize their semiconductor       electronic devices, from 2007 onwards.
The companies were made aware of       the new technique developed at Bristol at European Space Agency (ESA) &#8212;       Ministry of Defense (MoD) workshops in Europe, CS-Mantech in the USA and       other industry meetings.
As result of this, measurements were performed in       Bristol on 100s of industry supplied devices, paid by industry (total in       excess of &#163;200k), to thermally optimize device structures, determine       device lifetime, and ultimately for the qualification of new technology to       fulfil industry and/or military standards to generate industrial impact.
This work also resulted in a patent [A].
Nature, extent and beneficiaries of the impact       The research enabled companies to develop more robust, reliable, higher       performing devices and circuits for high-end space, radar and       communication applications, in particular using GaN and GaAs technology.
Channel temperatures determined on the devices were correlated against       device failure rates, to predict device lifetime.
The results were used by       the companies to optimize processing and device design for enabling better       and more reliable devices.
Typically lifetimes of these devices in the       early stage of our interaction with the companies were in the 1000s of       hours, however, at least 106 hours in many cases 109       hours are needed for most commercial applications which most companies we       work with now achieve.
A typical example of how this technology has been implemented by industry       is United Monolithic Semiconductor (UMS), a joint venture between THALES       (France) and EADS GmbH (Germany) [B].
UMS is seen by European defence and       Space agencies and companies as the European supplier of US International       Traffics and Arms Regulation (ITAR) free GaN technology, as the export of       GaN technology from the US is heavily restricted.
Dr. H. Blanck from UMS states [B]: "As a result of these channel         temperature measurements we were able to freeze and qualify our GaN         technology, in addition support the further development of our current         commercial GaAs products, also providing customers with device         implementation critical technology information", ie UMS was able to       implement defined new production processes (`freeze') that are now used       for providing commercial GaN devices and circuits, which meet the needed       reliability criteria, and to support GaAs customer needs.
There is no       other experimental technique other than Raman thermography available that       can achieve the required accuracy in channel temperature information for       the qualification of GaN and GaAs technology [C].
Similar work to characterize channel temperature in semiconductor devices       was carried out for TriQuint (USA) [D], Selex Galileo (UK &amp; Italy)       [E], furthermore for Thales Alenia Spaciale (France), NXP (UK &amp;       Netherlands), QinetiQ (UK), Northrop Grumman (USA), Sharp (Japan) and       Hitachi Cable (Japan).
Raman thermography was for example used by TriQuint       USA in 2010 [D] to validate its thermal simulation models to enable       accurate channel temperature quantification for its GaN technology, to       enable its commercial GaN technology development.
It also was used to       enable the development of the TriQuint GaN-diamond integrated transistor       in 2012/2013 which featured in recent TriQuint and DARPA press releases       [F] developed for high end US defense applications.
Due to the uniqueness of the Bristol developed equipment, the       measurements were performed in the laboratories of the University of       Bristol, with devices sent by the companies or in cases Research &amp;       Development engineers of the companies travelled with the devices to       Bristol due to their sensitive nature (including from the USA).
The       University of Bristol is in process of licensing the IP of Raman       thermography to the semiconductor equipment manufacturer Quantum Focus       Instruments (QFI), San Diego, USA, also to develop a low cost version of       the Raman thermography system.
Evidence to corroborate the impact       UMS states [B] "For reasons of commercial confidentiality it is not         possible to give sales figures or any equivalent.
However, I can confirm         that UMS have invested significantly in commercialising the GaN         technology, and that it now forms a strategic part of our business         generating significant revenue.
In addition, GaAs RF technology already         is a large part of our sales figures.
The technology developed at the         University of Bristol and its use on our technology significantly         benefited us financially.
In 2009, the headcount at UMS was 255 people,         for sales of 47M&#8364;."
It is clear that the work done at Bristol has enabled the company to       enter the GaN market earlier than would otherwise have been possible,       giving it a competitive advantage over its rivals.
As due to confidential reasons sales figures can not be disclosed by UMS,       the large commercial impact of the Bristol development for UMS is       demonstrated by its willingness to directly pay for contract measurements       on their devices in Bristol.
These measurements were performed on a daily       rate charge basis of &#163;1200 + VAT, typically within 3-5 measurement days in       each measurement campaign.
UMS states [B] "our direct financial         contribution to the University of Bristol for contract measurements well         exceeded &#163;50,000, in addition to the direct benefits to us from         measurements performed by Bristol on our technology paid to Bristol by         ESA under the GREAT2 contracts, and by the         European Defence Agency (EDA) under the MANGA (manufacturable GaN)         contract."
Direct UMS contract measurements were performed 2007 -       present.
Financial contributions to Bristol for contract measurements from       ESA (`High power GaN HFET for ESA applications &#8212; GREAT2 [G])       amounted to Euro 150k (2008-2014), and by the European Defense Agency       (MANGA [H]) to &#163;300k (2010-2014).
