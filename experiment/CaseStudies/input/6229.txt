     Hussey's research into the interrelations between French literature of       `Extremism' and Anglo-American culture has been disseminated through       books, newspapers, radio and magazines, leading to enhanced public       awareness of and engagement with issues of historical and political       context.
Throughout his academic career, Hussey has been committed to       communicating his work beyond an academic audience, not just in the UK but       internationally.
During the period, Hussey has given 48 invited lectures to non-academic       audiences.
These include the Cheltenham Literary Festival, The South Bank,       The ICA, Free University of Berlin, and The British Council Algeria.
His       books appear on university syllabuses across the world, not only in       Departments of French but also history, urbanism, and cultural studies.
In       2011 Hussey was awarded an OBE for `Services to Anglo-French Cultural       Relations'.
The reach of Hussey's research`s impact is evidenced by       sales figures: c.25,000 copies of his Game of War (2001) in the       UK; c.500,000 copies of Paris &#8212; The Secret History (2006)       worldwide.
The Game of War was also chosen by Kevin Jackson as book of the       week on Radio 4's Open Book (October 10, 2001).
Paris &#8212; The         Secret History was well reviewed in Le Monde 21.4.07 and L'Humanit&#233;       21.11.07 and Jacques Munier's Book of the Week on France-Culture 4.10.07.
It was shortlisted for the Prix Grandgousier 2007.
The impact of Hussey's       research goes far beyond the area of traditional French Studies to readers       from a wide range of backgrounds.
As the sales figures indicate, the range       is much broader than academic.
Hussey has written and presented a series of BBC Radio 4 documentaries       based on this research.
They are:     Liberty, Fraternity, Anarchy (Broadcast April 14 2011), about the       links between French avant-gardists and the British punk movement.
This       was praised in the press (The Observer, 6 March 2011).
The Beat Hotel (Broadcast May 20th, 2012) &#8212; a       documentary on the history of the so-called `Beat Hotel' in Paris;     The Art of Heroin (2013) &#8212; a documentary on the influence of       heroin on the Situationists and the Beat Generation.
The BBC estimates an audience of c.1.5 million for each of these       programmes.
The significance of Hussey's impact is witnessed by public       recognition of his work.
The 2001 book Game of War was named as       `International Book of the Year' in the TLS by Julian Barnes.
Paris         &#8212; The Secret History has now been translated into 12 languages.
The       French version was shortlisted for the Prix Grandgousier (2008), well       reviewed in Le Monde, L'Humanit&#233; and made Jacques Munier's       book of the week on France-Culture.
Two BBC4 90-minute documentaries, Treasures         of the Louvre (2013) and France on a Plate (2009), written       and presented by Hussey, were directly influenced by work in this book.
Both films were well reviewed and France on a Plate has been used       as teaching material in Sheffield schools.
