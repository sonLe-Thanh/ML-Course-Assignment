     The main focus for this case study is the Abertoir Festival based in       Aberystwyth, Wales, an annual festival that commenced in 2007.
It is an       increasingly significant cult and fantasy festival on the international       circuit and is currently the only festival of its kind in Wales and one of       only three UK festivals (along with Leeds and Frightfest) to be members of       the European Fantastic Film Festivals Federation.
There has also been       impact in relation to the annual Offscreen Festival based in Brussels, a       similarly themed cult and fantasy festival that commenced in 2008.
European cult film festivals of this kind tend to operate in a similar       manner, offering screening of new films and revivals alongside       opportunities for fans to meet directors and actors associated with this       area of culture.
The appearance of academics in these festivals is not       unheard of and occasionally separate symposia or conferences will be run       alongside the festivals proper (with the London-based Cine-Excess, in       which all the researchers associated with this case study are involved, a       key example).
However, the integration of research-based input from a       group of researchers into the main festival programme, such as was the       case especially with Abertoir in 2012 but also at Offscreen in 2012, is       unusual and innovative.
In both cases, the aim of the engagement between Northumbria researchers       and festival organisers has been to enhance the educational context of the       festivals.
This has been most evident for Abertoir, where the organisers       have bid for additional funding as a result of input from Northumbria       staff based on their research.
The most obvious product of the developing       relationship with Offscreen during the census period has been an       AHRC-funded international research network (awarded in December 2012),       which includes Offscreen as a participant and which has fostered       research-led engagement led by PI Sexton along with Hunter and Hutchings       with non-academic users of research, including festival programmers and       other producers and distributors of cult material.
Staff involved in the case study were initially approached by the       festival directors of Abertoir and Offscreen respectively.
A series of       meetings and communications commenced early in 2012 and built on       pre-existing informal contacts.
As a result of these, Hunter, Hutchings       and Sexton were all involved in providing research-derived material for       the week-long Abertoir event that took place in November 2012; this       included written material for festival brochures, public lectures and       presentations to the festival audiences.
This material connected directly       with published research outputs thus:             Hunter: hour-long public lecture `The Horrible History of Italian         horror' and brochure entry `Italian Horror Cinema' &#8212; which placed         Italian horror in a broader European context and which in this drew upon         research into Italian and Belgian horror in Hunter 2012 and 2013.
Hutchings: 20-minute introduction to British Science Fiction and         short brochure entry on Italian horror.
The first drew upon Hutchings'         1999 research into the British SF invasion film, and especially his work         there on the historical context of the Quatermass stories.
The second         drew on the exploration of Italianate cinematic excess in Hutchings 2003         and 2012.
Sexton: 20-minute introductory talk on 3D cult movies and brochure         entry on `Rocky Horror Picture Show' &#8212; all drawing directly upon         explorations of cult cultures in Sexton 2011.
The 2012 festival had its highest ever attendance figures, with 3,300       admissions.
As a result of Northumbria-led input, the festival organisers       were able to report to the principal funder a significant enhancement in       the educational content of the festival in comparison with previous years:       "This year, we made a strong push to provide a much wider educational         aspect than in previous years and teamed up with the University of         Northumbria in a series of activities and elements that have taken our         engagement with education to new levels" (Source: Evaluation Report       for Film Agency of Wales).
Consequently they were able to bid for       additional funding from the Film Agency for Wales for the 2013 festival.
Input into Offscreen included a presentation by Sexton on cult cinema and       a presentation by Hunter on Italian cult cinema.
Both of these served to       demonstrate to festival funding agencies an educational profile for the       event, and supported the festival director's aspiration that Offscreen be       "more than just a festival".
Key to this relationship has been Sexton's       Cult Cinema network.
The Offscreen Director confirms that the contribution       of Sexton and Hunter has enhanced: "the internationalisation of the         festival and the reinforcement of its educational part.
Collaborating         with your Cult Network has also helped in profiling the festival even         more deliberately and consciously into the cult territory and brought         the ambition of mixing an academic with a festival approach and audience         a step closer."

Impact activity for both festivals will continue to evolve after the       census period, with staff invited to contribute to Abertoir in 2013 and       Offscreen in 2014.
