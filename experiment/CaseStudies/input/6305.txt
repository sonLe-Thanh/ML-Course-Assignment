     The systematic review set out in this case study has underpinned the       development of interventions by the Irish Institute of Sport and       sportscotland for athletes experiencing a career transition.
Following the       publication of the research findings in the International Review of Sport       and Exercise Psychology in May 2012 the research has been used by the       Irish Institute of Sport and sportscotland Institute of Sport to formulate       their career transition programmes for athletes.
Both organisations       indicated that central to their capacity to design a best practice       intervention was their ability to draw upon the systematic review       findings.
The research helped them understand, and immediately provide,       better services to athletes who were demonstrating a diverse set of career       transition support needs.
"The research as published by you and your colleagues has allowed us         to get a macro view of the factors that affect the athlete career         transition adjustment process.
The findings have allowed us to design a         multi-dimensional support programme that contains a series of proactive         and reactive support processes....All of these supports have been         designed to effectively transition athletes out of the London 2012 games         experience and correlate to the suggested support measures as indicated         by your review."
(Head of Performance Skills, Irish Institute of Sport)     The research team provided training in the research findings to staff at       the Irish Institute of Sport.
As stated above, this has specifically       allowed that organisation to create an athlete transition profiling       process that aims to predict the onset of transition related difficulties.
The Irish Institute of Sport can now proactively identify those athletes       who are at risk of adjustment related difficulties in order to initiate       proactive support measures well in advance.
As a result the Irish       Institute of Sport are intervening with athletes and providing proactive       support measures before the onset of a difficult career transition.
The       findings of the systematic review has also shaped the professional       development of the career transition support teams, consisting of       psychologists and advisors through a series of workshops run by the       research team that were based on the research findings.
In the Republic of Ireland, the research has had impact on the       development of the Irish Institute of Sport athlete support strategy       leading into and after the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
The       research has informed the development of a proactive athlete career       transition support programme for 219 athletes across 24 sports, which was       developed in 2012.
As stated above by the Head of Performance Skills the       research has also led to the design of a "multi-dimensional support       intervention" The research has also informed the establishment, in 2012,       of the "first ever defined post-game athlete support programme         involving a series of diverse supports" (Head of Performance Skills,       Irish Institute of Sport), including post-event debriefing led by a       dedicated team of psychologists, in order to effectively support athletes       retiring from sport.
The impacts at the Irish Institute of Sport are significant, and have       been on-going since 2012.
The Institute has listed the following five       points as impacts emerging from the research:            A more systematic approach to managing athlete career transitions       Alignment of NGBs with the Institute's Performance Transition         Programme       Proactive monitoring and evaluation of athletes career adjustment         difficulties       More informed government funding of athlete development       Better informed Institute staff.
The impact at the sportscotland Institute of Sport is on-going and has       primarily affected the training and development of sportscotland staff.
"We ran two very successful continual development workshops, The focus         of these workshops stemmed in content from [the] review paper..."     (Head of Science and Innovation, sportscotland Institute of Sport)     The beneficiaries, in Scotland, are the athletes being supported by the       programmes, as well as the psychologists and advisors who have benefitted       through professional development training.
