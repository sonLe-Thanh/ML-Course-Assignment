     The AAA project, run in collaboration with SKOR, had a long-lasting       impact on how SKOR now approaches commissioning new works itself, and on       the recommendations it provides for commissioning practices by       organisations in the Netherlands and internationally in it new       institutional forms (see below).
The full team of 20 SKOR curators and       coordinators attended both the key symposia,[1][2] which       were widely publicised; they attracted over 400 professionals from the       arts funding sector, social services sector as well as artists, curators,       architects, urban planners, health and housing professionals, journalists       and critics (visitors came from Germany, France, Scandinavia, the UK, the       USA, Spain, Albania, Mexico as well as from all over the Netherlands: 50%       of the audience were members of the general public).
SKOR conducted an       Impact Assessment at the end of the project, and considers it to have been       extremely valuable and effective in stimulating new approaches.
Comments       in the report[3] include the following:     - `This project is a great example of the impact and contribution of         AAA-symposium series to new forms of commissioning ...
Traditionally a         commissioner approaches SKOR to commission a work of art, and after         initial discussions a short-list of artists is being prepared.
However         in this case AAA served as a catalyst, and the artist laid out the         blueprint for a future commissioning project.
As part of the symposium         programme, SKOR invited a selection of artists to reflect on recent         precarious developments in healthcare.
Martijn Engelbregt came up with         the proposal to set up a broad research exhibition on the impact of         health, in close collaboration with the commissioner of Haaglanden         Medical Centre.
This byproduct of the symposium is now being developed         into an exciting new commission examining the potential beneficial         effect of art, if measurable.
On 9 November 2012 a publicly accessible         research exhibition has opened in Haaglanden Medical Centre.
For the         first time a scientific answer is sought to the question: What is the         effect of art on our health?
[SKOR Business Director][3]     - `SKOR has directly changed its traditional way of thinking about         audiences and audience participation, because of the AAA symposium         series'     - `Because the topics are directly addressing socio-political issues,         such as healthcare and social housing, we were able to appeal to a much         broader audience than a merely art-related one, allowing health workers,         professionals, policy makers, opinion leaders to engage with         contemporary art from another perspective.'
Facing cuts to its budget due to changes in government policy, SKOR       reshaped its activities in 2012 into four separate organisations of which       two were directly influenced by the AAA project:     (a) TAAK:[4] SKOR's international cultural       platform to develop and present art that relates to societal issues such       as ecology, civic awareness, social design and human rights.
It pioneers       placing topics of public interest on the agenda of arts institutions in       the Netherlands, and using art to investigate how new types of social       initiatives and citizenship can be developed.
Working with its partners       Haaglanden Medical Centre, TU Delft, EGBG, GEMAK and Hersencentrum, it set       out to investigate the effects of art on (public) health, a question that       was initially posed through AAA, via a project called Better: the Art         of Health &#8212; a research exhibition and symposium open to the public       from 09/11/12 to 08/02/13.
About 50 artworks were displayed in the       Haaglanden Medical Centre and Convenience, both in The Hague, and their       possible health benefits explored through investigations which took place       in waiting rooms, meetings rooms, corridors and operating rooms.
Some       patients were asked to take artworks home as part of the investigation.
The findings, published as a report,[5] and an       end-of-project symposium in June 2013 attended by the public and       politicians, scientists, doctors, and artists set out policy       recommendations.
(b) SKOR International: This is now linked to the European Network       of Public Art Producers, which SKOR helped to found in 2010; Phillips and       Erdemci are advisors to it.
[6] Its activities, which       have been influenced by findings from the AAA project, include large-scale       presentations of permanent and temporary art projects, symposia, and the       development of institutional alliances.
Phillips and Erdemci are currently       working on the third edition of Actors Agents and Attendants under SKOR       International's aegis, and in 2016 will assist it to co-produce the next       Sonsbeek festival in Arnheim, with a specific focus on artistic and       political futures of the public.
Istanbul Biennial 2013     The expertise Phillips demonstrated through her leadership of the AAA       project led to her being invited by Erdemci (overall curator of the       Istanbul Biennial) to co-curate a public programme at the Biennial       focusing on transformations of the public realm, particularly in Istanbul       itself.
[7] This involved organising three large events       (each with discussions, lectures and performances) between February and       May.
The themes related directly to Erdemci and Phillips' research: Art's       role in the production of cultural capital in the city; the connections       between this and gentrification; and the privatisation of public space and       the ways in which this impacts on citizens' experience of and right to the       city.
Asking these questions and organising these events in Istanbul at a time       in which major urban clearances were being sanctioned by the Turkish       government in order to develop new private housing, retail, and tourist       facilities proved explosive.
Turkey has no public institutions in the       Northern European sense, and the concept of public space is itself       contested and differentiated through Ottoman and Islamic tradition;       protestors therefore singled out the Biennial for its participation in the       very forms Phillips and Erdemci were attempting to question.
The Biennial       was attended by over 350,000 people, and the public programme (to be       published in book from in 2014, with a long article by Phillips) proved to       be a major locus of protest for local people, preceding by a few months       the events in Taksim Square and Gezi Park that captured world headlines.
