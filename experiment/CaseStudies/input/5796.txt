     Building on scientific studies published from 2002 onwards, the direct       impact of arsenic and rice       investigations within the assessment period (2008-2013) were based on       human health impacts,       resulting in action by regulators, legislators, consumers and the food       industry.
The first assessment period impact was when focus turned to rice products       and it was       hypothesised that baby rice and rice milk might be problematic, resulting       in the first papers in this       area [5 &amp; 6 above], which were critical of the lack of legislation       regarding arsenic in foods.
As a       result of these studies, and those that the FSA had commissioned itself,       the FSA advised in May       2009 the following: `As a precaution, toddlers and young children         between 1 and 4.5 years old         should not have rice drinks as a replacement for cows' milk, breast         milk, or infant formula.
This is         because they will then drink a relatively large amount of it, and their         intake of arsenic will be         greater than that of older children and adults relative to their         bodyweight.
This is both on nutritional         grounds and because such substitution can increase their intake of         inorganic arsenic, which should         be kept as low as possible.
A daily half pint or 280 millilitres of rice         drink could double the amount         of the more harmful form of arsenic they consume each day" [a].
Thus       the FSA directly acted on       the findings and advice of the Aberdeen University rice milk paper.
The Aberdeen studies on arsenic in rice culminating in the baby rice and       baby milk surveys also       prompted a major reassessment in 2009 of inorganic arsenic exposure of the       EU populace by the       EFSA [c].
This review by an assembled expert panel reached the same       conclusion as had the       Aberdeen studies on both rice milk and baby rice.
Another major conclusion       from this EFSA       review was that the World Health Organization's inorganic arsenic       Provisional Maximum Tolerable       Daily Intake (PMTDI) was based on flawed calculations, was thus too high,       and was not       scientifically sustainable.
The Aberdeen group had initiated this debate       through its series of       papers on rice, and indeed was the first and most vocal critic of this       PMTDI with respect to food       intakes.
As the WHO PMTDI represented the only international benchmark of       inorganic arsenic       intake in any ingested item, it had been widely used to justify that       inorganic arsenic intakes from       rice were `safe'.
This was a highly flawed argument that did not stand       scientific scrutiny, as rice is       the dominant source of inorganic arsenic globally, not water.
While both       the WHO and EU have       set strict and low levels of what is the maximum allowed inorganic arsenic       in drinking water, given       that there are regions of the world that suffer from naturally elevated       arsenic in drinking waters,       they have not set food standards for inorganic arsenic.
The EFSA review       and criticism of the       PMTDI led directly to rapid withdrawal of this WHO standard.
The Aberdeen       group published a       critique of the current state of arsenic standards globally (Meharg AA       &amp; Raab A (2010) Getting to       the bottom of arsenic standards and guidelines.
Environmental Science         &amp; Technology 44, 4395-4399)       which was published before the WHO withdrew their arsenic PMTDI.
A Dartmouth College PNAS study on baby rice in 2011 which followed up in       a US context the       Aberdeen group's earlier work on elevated arsenic concentrations in rice       and the need to regulate       arsenic in food, received considerable global media coverage and has led       to the US congress       asking the US FDA to consider setting arsenic standards in food,       (http://www.pnas.org/content/108/51/20656.full).
The EU, WHO and USA are all currently considering setting arsenic       standards in food as illustrated       by the EFSA (2009) review and FDAs published concerns and timelines       (http://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/consumerupdates/ucm319827.htm)       and specific calls by the US       congress to set standards for arsenic in rice       (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/21/rice-act-       arsenic-delauro-pallone-lowey_n_1904490.html).
The BBSRC have explicitly identified Meharg's work regarding arsenic in       rice as part of their "Our       Impact": http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/research/impact/arsenic-levels-in-food.aspx       Claimed impact as defined by REF guidance includes: evidence of         awareness of health risks and         benefits by consumers; clinical and dietary guidelines have changed;         public health, well-being has         improved and public behaviour has changed; documented changes to public         health policies;         advisory committees and guidelines; decisions by regulatory authorities         has been influenced by         research.
