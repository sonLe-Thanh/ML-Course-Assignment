     (i) Public Policy change &#8212; Encouragement of self-regulation     The research S3.1 and S3.2 and resulting engagement/dissemination       opportunities formed part of       the evidence base for national and international policy and advisory       transport documents (e.g.
"Maintaining Safe Mobility for the Ageing Population" RAC Foundation         (2010), see S5.1 and S5.2).
In addition to citation in this high profile commentary, Holland was       recognised as one of very few       researchers in this country with specific expertise on older road users       and was thus invited by the       RAC Foundation to take part as a discussant in final amendments before       launch.
As a further       consequence, the Foundation continued its review of self-assessment tools       for older drivers and a       new document was launched in February 2013 (S5.3 which cites S3.1) to       which Holland further       contributed as an expert discussant.
The outputs of research on illness and medication for older drivers       (S3.2) and older pedestrians       (S3.3) has been used as part of the evidence base for the Parliamentary       Advisory Council for       Transport Safety (PACTS, 2012) `It's my choice: Safer mobility for an       ageing population' (S5.4).
Holland was interviewed for BBC Six O'Clock News on the launch date to       improve public       awareness of the research.
S3.1 and S3.2 are both available on the DfT website and cited by       international policy sources:       including EU road safety commission website: Mobility and Transport, under       "Road Safety       Knowledge Base" (S5.5) and the 2010 UNDP "A Review of International Best       Practice in       Accessible Public Transportation for Persons with Disabilities" (S5.6).
(ii) Society &#8212; Attitudes and stereotypes of older drivers     Analyses outlined in the reviews and subsequent empirical research has       contributed to a change in       both public and professional attitudes and a change in societal       stereotypes of older drivers as       unsafe.
Enabling older adults' to self-regulate their driving       appropriately (S3.2, S3.6), based on       awareness of individual sensory and cognitive changes, has gradually       become the target of       recommendations, as opposed to traditional aims of encouraging driving       cessation.
This is       reported in the DfT Strategic Framework for Road Safety (2011):"We know         many older drivers are         able to self-regulate their driving behaviour ...
But with an         increasingly ageing population, many of         whom will be continuing to drive many years after retirement, it is         important that drivers are able to         maintain and adapt their skills to ensure continued safe mobility as         they age" (p57, S5.7) and in the       recent RAC document on self-assessment (2013): "Older drivers' safe         driving performance has         been repeatedly attributed to `self-regulation'" (p10, S5.3).
(iii) Society &#8212; Awareness and understanding; impacts on activities and         practice of charities         and professional bodies     Our research suggests that when older people stop driving prematurely it       has serious impacts on       their quality of life and places them at increased risk as a pedestrian.
Enabling drivers and advisors       to have confidence to address perceived issues rather than cease driving,       will have significant       impact on reducing isolation and disempowerment.
A key part of this       enabling strategy has been       the dissemination of findings to end-users, particularly practitioners.
To       this end Holland has       developed and presented professional development workshops to national       practitioner bodies.
For       example, Holland attended the Midlands Occupational Therapy Conference in       2010 to deliver a       presentation and workshop to support 150 occupational therapists, medics       and other healthcare       practitioners in helping older people make driving decisions (S5.8).
Holland presented the pedestrian research outcomes, (S3.3; S3.4; S3.5) at       an invited seminar to       members of INRETS, (now IFSTTAR &#8212; French Transport Institute, Lyon 2010).
This dissemination       was a significant precursor to evaluation of a new training intervention       for older pedestrians which       demonstrated safer crossing as a positive outcome, with impact on safety       of older pedestrians in       France (S5.9).
Evidence from S3.1 was also used as part of the evidence       base for the Help the       Aged document "Keeping on the Move" (2008) widely used by older drivers       and those who advise       them (S5.10).
