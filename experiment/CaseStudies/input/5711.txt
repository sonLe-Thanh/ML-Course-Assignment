     The technology, which was invented and developed at the University of       Bath, was patented in 1997 and eventually transferred to a purpose-built       MDI filling line at Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A., Parma, Italy [4,5].
All       research and development activities relating to the Modulite&#174;       technology remained within the Centre of Drug Formulation Studies (CDFS)       at the University of Bath until 2000.
For several years thereafter, Chiesi       then sponsored further fee-for-service development work employing 17       members of staff before, in 2010, the Italian parent company opened its       own purpose-built laboratories in Chippenham.
The original University of       Bath employees, who had conceived the Modulite&#174; technology, and       had been working on the Chiesi-sponsored research and development, formed       the core of this new structure (Chiesi UK, Ltd.).
The laboratory at       Chippenham (which now employs 13 full-time staff) is tasked with producing       new formulations having improved drug delivery efficiency resulting in       enhanced absorption and therapeutic efficacy of the Modulite&#174;       technology.
The Drug Delivery Technologies Director of Chiesi has stated that, "The         team at Bath... showed that addition of a low volatility component to a         propellant containing HFA and a co-solvent to solubilise the drug could         controllably increase the aerodynamic diameter of the aerosol particles         on actuation from a metered dose inhaler (MDI).
Their input led to [the]         patent application on the addition of a low voltaility component in         modulating an MDI having HFAs as propellant that was pharmaceutically         and clinically equivalent to our exisiting MDIs which used CFCs.
This         technology was [named] Modulite&#174;."
The Modulite&#174; technology currently generates for the Chiesi       group revenues of around $450M per annum [7].
The impact of the Modulite&#174; technology has been widely       recognised by the pharmaceutical industry through successful partnership       and collaboration agreements with leading pharmaceutical companies,       including GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Novartis and AstraZeneca.
Specific examples include:            GSK has a semi-exclusive international license and supply agreement         for Modulite&#174; beclomethasone dipropionate for treatment of         asthma in a number of European and non-European countries.
Novartis has a semi-exclusive international license and supply         agreement for a Modulite&#174; formoterol product for the         treatment of asthma in a number of European and non-European countries.
Chiesi's leading marketed product is Modulite&#174; Fostair/Foster,       which is a fixed combination of beclometasone dipropionate       (corticosteroid) and formoterol fumarate (long-acting 03b22-agonist) with       rapid onset of its therapeutic effect.
Chiesi's Drug Delivery Technologies Director affirms that, "As a         result of [the Bath] invention, Chiesi has successfully developed and         launched three products (Atimos Modulite &#174; &#8212;         Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate (FFD), Clenil Modulite&#174; &#8212;         Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) and Foster Modulite&#174; &#8212; a         fixed combination of FFD and BDP) across European and other territories.
For certain territories, Chiesi has also licensed the distribution and         sales of the Modulite &#174; products through GSK,         Novartis and other primary pharmaceutical companies.
Foster Modulite       &#174; has become Chiesi's top selling product, with sales in         2012 in excess of $300,000,000 and is now being sold in over 35 counties         worldwide; further launches are planned throughout 2013-2014."
In 2010, Foster became Chiesi's top selling product [8] and in the 2012       Chiesi Group annual report, the company's chairman announced that market       figures have indicated that: "Foster is the biggest-selling product         resulting from Italian [sponsored] research in the world" [9].
The Foster/Fostair product was further approved in November 2012 as a       maintenance and reliever therapy in 35 European countries thus confirming       its efficacy both for maintenance and "as- needed" therapy.
Furthermore, a       Foster MDI COPD clinical programme was successfully complet- ed in 2013,       which will result in a marketing application for this new indication.
The Drug Delivery Technologies Director of Chiesi concludes, "The 10+         year collaboration between Chiesi and CDFS at the University of Bath has         led to Chiesi's most successful product development programs and         Modulite&#174; continues to be at the forefront of our         R&amp;D programs involving new chemical entities for asthma and COPD."
In sum, the reach of the impact of the Bath-based research described here       is evident from the increasing use of the Modulite&#174; technology       in products used across the globe; the significance lies not only in the       technical success of the science driven by an environmental imperative,       but also the key achievement of assuring the efficacy of potent drugs by       their effective delivery using formulation skill combined with clever       device engineering.
