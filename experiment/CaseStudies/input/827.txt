     Two strategic research challenges were identified for the research at       Leeds in 2000:            To create regenerative biological scaffolds for cardiovascular tissue         repairs such as heart valves and cardiovascular patches;       To create regenerative biological scaffolds for the repair of thicker,         three-dimensional musculoskeletal soft tissue such as ligaments, tendons         and menisci.
The unique approach taken at Leeds has generated tissue-specific       biological scaffolds and patents for each tissue repair application.
This       contrasts with previous commercial biological scaffold approaches that       developed a single scaffold material with one set of properties and       applied it to many different applications.
Failure to match site- and       tissue-specific properties can result in suboptimal physical performance       and regenerative response.
The commercial impact within the REF period has been enabled by       protecting the IP generated through the underpinning research in a number       of patents.
The first patent [A] protected the basic process and       demonstrated its application in heart valves and pericardium.
The patent       was filed prior to publication of the original research [1, 2] and is       supported by further research [3].
The second patent [B] protected       processes for biological scaffolds for ligament regeneration and is       supported by the research at Leeds [5].
The third patent family [C]       described biological scaffolds for meniscus regeneration and is supported       by the research at Leeds [6].
The patents are owned and sustained by the       University of Leeds and have been licensed to Tissue Regenix plc for       commercial use and NHS Blood &amp; Transplant Tissue Services for use on       allograft tissue within the NHS in the UK [A,B,C].
Economic impact       The University of Leeds spinout company Tissue Regenix was incorporated in       2006.
Fisher was founding chairman and Ingham was founding       director.
The corroborating statement [F], together with sources [D] and       [E], confirms that the impacts of the underpinning research, the patents       and the IP licensed to the company during the REF period has been as       follows.
The original patent families were licensed into the company and       first-round investment was secured from IP Group in early 2007.
Second-round investment was secured in 2008 to support development and       manufacture of the first commercial product.
A full-time chief executive       and new company chairman were appointed to lead commercialisation and take       the company to the market.
Clinical trials were undertaken in 2009 on the       first commercial product, the dCELL&#174; Vascular Patch, which was       CE marked as a Class III medical device and launched as a commercial       product in autumn 2010 [D].
The company was floated on the Alternative       Investment Market (AIM) as Tissue Regenix Group (TRG) in 2010 and, in       2012, raised further funds (&#163;25M) to support development of a wider range       of commercial products for cardiovascular and musculoskeletal       applications.
TRG`s market CAP, at a share price of 11p, is &#163;70M (2012       valuation) and it is investing over &#163;32M of private capital in new product       development, currently employing 35 people [D,E,F].
The University of       Leeds is a shareholder and investor in TRG.
Fisher and Ingham are       shareholders and scientific advisers to the company.
The dCELL&#174; Vascular Patch is now sold throughout Europe [E].
A       second commercial product, the dCELL&#174; Meniscal Repair device,       is being developed, with clinical trials planned for 2014 [F].
A third       commercial product, a biological scaffold for ligament repair, is now in       commercial development.
The University continues to collaborate with the       company and supports commercial development of products through its       Innovation and Knowledge Centre in Medical Technologies-Regenerative       Therapies and Devices (IKCRTD, grant x).
The University has contributed highly skilled personnel to Tissue Regenix       Group, with Leeds PDRA Graindorge employed as chief operating officer and       Leeds PDRA Berry, n&#233;e Wilcox, working as the company's chief       scientist (co-author on [1,2,3,4]).
Health impact.
Statement [F] confirms that the dCELL&#174; Vascular Patch has       completed a successful clinical trial, been CE marked and is bringing       benefits to patients undergoing endarterectomies for peripheral vascular       disease [6].
Source [G] confirms that clinical studies using the       technology have been reported for heart valve replacement by the       researcher collaborators in Brazil, with improved outcomes at four years       for pulmonary valve replacements.
Statement [H] confirms that NHS Blood &amp; Transplant Tissue Services       has licensed the technology for creating biological scaffolds from       allogeneic tissues.
They are currently undertaking clinical studies on an       acellular biological scaffold for dermal repair, with initial results       already reported, and are investing in collaborative development projects       on cardiac patches, acellular heart valves, acellular vascular grafts and       acellular ligaments supported by translation projects through IKCRTD.
