     In order to facilitate implementation, novel interventions must be       acceptable to patients and professionals, and be at least equally       effective as current management but delivered at a lower cost.
The       compelling nature of the research evidence regarding the clinical       effectiveness (refs.
2-5), cost-effectiveness (refs.
2,4) and user       acceptability (ref.
1) of the refined ESCAPE programme trialled within a       clinical context (refs.
2, 3, 5) has resulted in NICE Quality, Innovation,       Productivity and Prevention (QIPP) approval [source 1].
The QIPP programme       is a national Department of Health/NICE strategy aimed at improving the       quality and delivery of NHS care while reducing costs.
The quality of the       evidence to support the inclusion of the ESCAPE intervention was       independently evaluated by the programme and reported as achieving 58%       cost savings and 66% improvements in treatment quality compared to       standard physiotherapy practice [source 1].
Consequently, the intervention       is now flagged up to commissioners, managers and clinicians across the       NHS, as an intervention that should be considered for replication to       improve the quality of care for people with this condition whilst       contributing to the &#163;20 billion efficiency savings by 2014/15.
QIPP approval will assist with further translation of ESCAPE into       practice.
Meanwhile, the intervention has already been adopted in       departments across the UK including Kent [source 2] and Bristol [source       3]; and the intervention has also been adapted for use in Caerphilly and       Edinburgh.
Inclusion in NICE guidelines for OA has also raised the profile       of the intervention [source 5].
The impact on clinical departments is noted in changes to service       delivery [sources 2-3], beneficial patient outcomes [sources 2-4],       resultant cost savings [source 2], development of an evidence- based       culture [sources 2-3] and continuing professional development       opportunities for staff engaged in research programmes [source 2-3].
Clinical departments in Kent and Bristol note that ESCAPE has become the       `intervention of choice' for people with chronic joint pain [sources 2-3].
Service managers across Kent have endorsed the programme resulting in roll       out across the whole county (population approximately 1.75 million),       whilst GPs in that area are specifically referring patients for the ESCAPE       programme rather than standard physiotherapy [source 2].
The cost savings       apportioned to ESCAPE adoption are significant, approximated at a 50%       saving to the physiotherapy budget for chronic joint pain across one       county [source 2].
The recognised benefits of the ESCAPE programme have also resulted in       development of similar interventions for other pathologies based on the       ESCAPE content and ethos.
University Hospitals Bristol Rheumatology       Department have implemented a programme for people with Ankylosing       Spondylitis [source 3].
A similar approach has been taken for chronic back       pain patients in Kent [source 2].
Furthermore an innovative `Pay As You       Go' approach has been adopted in Kent whereby individuals who have       benefited from the ESCAPE programme can continue attending the       physiotherapy department gymnasium to maintain exercise participation.
These sessions are self-funded, thus providing a financial return to the       department [source 2].
The importance of the clinical benefit of ESCAPE is evidenced by feedback       from individuals who have participated in the programme.
Testimonials from       individuals state `I gained the knowledge that I could continue to move       safely despite the pain'; `I was more mobile and able to walk further and       do the stairs with less pain'; `It was good to be part of a group and to       feel I was not the only one suffering bad back pain' [source 2].
Furthermore a promotional video of the ESCAPE intervention produced by       Arthritis Research UK (ARUK) featured other individuals who had benefited       from the programme, stating `It gives you information that you'd never       known before'; `I've become more mobile and have less pain'; `It's been       enlightening' [source 4].
This video is used by ARUK to educate       individuals regarding the benefits of the programme and to encourage       individuals to participate in physical activity, and has been published by       ARUK on YouTube as a resource for people with OA [source 4].
The success and further potential of the ESCAPE programme has resulted in       ARUK awarding &#163;41,000 [grant 6] to Dr Walsh and colleagues to develop an       online version of the programme to enable more people to access the       intervention (education and an online exercise programme); and further       funding from ARUK [grant 5] and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy       Charitable Trust [grant 4] has facilitated further development and       roll-out of the intervention.
