     Microwave Endometrial Ablation     In 1997, The University of Bath founded Microsulis Medical Ltd to       commercialise Professor Nigel       Cronin's invention of a device for microwave endometrial ablation (MEA).
Endometrial ablation is a       treatment for severe cases of menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) as an       alternative to       hysterectomy.
Following clinical trials       [5], Microsulis' MEA device was       approved by the National Institute for       Clinical Excellence (NICE) [9], the U.S.       Food and Drug Administration (FDA)       [9] and gained the European kite mark.
The device underwent further       development over the past 15 years       and since 2008 has been widely used       to treat menorrhagia.

The treatment is fast and safe and can treat all areas of the uterus         [9,11].
It removes the         danger of death (0.1%) [12] associated with hysterectomy.
A success rate of over 80% in dramatically reducing or stopping         menstrual bleeding         [9,11,13].
Treatment only takes three minutes and because it is minimally         invasive, patients usually         go home the same day [9].
This compares with the 3-6 days hospital stay         associated with a         typical hysterectomy, followed by recuperation time of anything up to         two months [11,12].
Accordingly there are huge savings in time for doctors and patients         alike.
Additionally,         because the uterus remains intact, there are also major psychological         advantages for the         patient.
This all translates into massive cost savings for health care         providers.
[9]          In February 2011, Microsulis sold the rights to its MEA device to       Novasure of Massachusetts for       $3M [14].
The sale provided funding for Microsulis to develop       ground-breaking devices for       microwave tissue ablation (MTA) and percutaneous microwave tissue ablation       (pMTA) based on       Cronin's research.
Microwave Tissue Ablation     The idea behind MTA is to use microwaves to produce a highly controlled,       localised and rapid       heating that destroys cancerous tumours.
Initial development work       concentrated on liver tumours       [3-6].
Secondary liver tumours are common in cases of bowel cancer and, if       they are controlled,       there is a good chance of preventing further spread of the cancer.
An MTA       device for use in open       surgery has been developed and following successful clinical trials [3,6]       obtained CE mark and       United States FDA approval [15].
Since its launch in 2008, over 100 MTA       systems have been       installed in hospitals around the world and nearly 700 treatments have       been completed, with high       success rates [10,16].
A needle-like (percutaneous) MTA device has also been developed and       gained European CE       mark, ETL safety accreditation and United States FDA approval [15] in       2010.
The device has the       great advantage of being applied through the skin, rather than requiring       open surgery.
This has a       number of advantages for patients, doctors and hospitals alike:            It gives surgeons the option to treat previously inoperable         patients with tumours in         inaccessible locations [6,17].
A recent international review of clinical effectiveness [16] found         that of 250 ablated tumours         in 135 patients, local recurrence was observed at only 5% of         ablated sites       The treatment costs approximately &#163;2,500 per session and it         can be repeated.
Surgery costs up to twice this amount and         there is less chance it can be repeated [18].
The procedure is less invasive than open surgery, meaning less         time in theatre, fewer medical complications and shorter         recuperation times [19].
Increased patient throughput and reduced operating and patient stay         costs and staff costs, leading to higher revenues in private healthcare         settings.
The Microsulis pTMA device          Initial use of the pTMA device has been for liver tumours [16], but lung       [18], kidney, pancreas and       bone treatments are being performed [10].
Although only released in late       2010, pMTA is already in       use at over 80 surgical and radiological centres [10].
Over 5000 patients       have been treated with       MTA/pTMA since 2008 and the number of new treatments is more than doubling       year on year [10].
Whilst there are many competing companies and devices in the oncology       arena, Microsulis are       well ahead of their competitors in terms of device performance and ease of       use.
Commenting on       the Microsulis system, the consultant radiologist at Oxford University       Hospitals Trust states "This is       a fantastic development.
It will kill small tumours in minutes and we are       examining how it can       improve survival by reducing cancer mass in larger tumours..... We believe       it could save -       thousands of lives a year."
[18]     Microsulis employ around 20 people at their Portsmouth base, from where       they produce and sell       their third-generation MTA and pMTA devices [10] (jobs in the medical       instruments sector carry a       high output multiplier of &#8776;2.5 [20]).
They have recently invested &#163;250k in       a new in-house       production and packaging facility, increasing its manufacturing capacity.
Microsulis's sales revenue       in the REF period totals over &#163;11m [10].
The company was named `Innovator       of the Year' at The       News Business Excellence Awards in 2012 and also claimed the runner up       prize in the `Exporter of       the Year' category [14].
In February 2013, Microsulis was acquired by AngioDynamics of Albany (New       York) &#8212; a leading       international provider of medical devices.
The sale for $15m [21] is       expected to provide new       impetus for global sales of the pMTA device (which is being marketed as       "Acculis MTA"), and       further improve patient access to this lifesaving technology.
In summary, Professor Cronin's invention of new technologies for medical       treatments has       revolutionised healthcare outcomes for tens of thousands of patients and       created substantial       economic impact both directly via the turnover of Microsulis Ltd and       indirectly via savings to       healthcare providers.
