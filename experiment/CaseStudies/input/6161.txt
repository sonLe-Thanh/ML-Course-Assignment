     Impact on public policy     Our work has two routes to impact.
First, through our relationships with       the Department of Health(DH) and second, through our partnership with Macmillan         Cancer Support.
Our research has inspired action to reorganise       cancer services through the recently established National Cancer         Survivorship Initiative (NCSI).
Increased awareness of the unmet       needs of cancer survivors as a result of our work supports major health       policy change in the UK and informed the NCSI 2010 Vision [5.5], and has       influenced policy internationally promoting greater involvement of cancer       survivors in developing health service priorities [5.2, 5.3].
As a result,       addressing the needs of people who survive cancer has become core to       public policy and is changing public perception of the disease.
The NCSI       has become an integral part of DH National Cancer Strategy and is       an important component of the DH's Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for         Cancer, published in January 2011.
Further evidence of direct impact       may be found in the National Cancer Research Institute Strategic Plan       for 2008-2013 [5.4] which proposed actions to address `detection,       diagnosis and prognosis' and `improving clinical outcomes and       survivorship' for those living with and beyond cancer by highlighting the       needs of cancer survivors to policymakers, funding bodies and service       providers.
More recently, our work on the experiences of women living with       metastatic breast cancer was widely cited by media and policymakers (for       example the NCSI report [5.6] published in March 2013).
The research,       funded by Breast Cancer Campaign, drew attention to this neglected       group and, for the first time, illustrated how the disease unfolds from       first diagnosis to death, using new mapping techniques devised at the       University of Southampton.
This research received attention in Parliament       [5.9] when Baroness Morgan referenced the study in the House of Lords in       November 2011 during the discussion of the Health and Social Care Bill,       and was widely publicised in the media [5.10, 5.11] including the Daily       Mail (circulation 1.8 million).
Most importantly this has led to the       development of a movement in support of the 36,000 women living with       secondary breast cancer in the UK [5.12].
Impact on services     More than a million people will benefit from new models of aftercare       resulting directly from the NCSI.
We demonstrated that cancer and the       emotional and physical side effects of cancer treatment impose an on-going       burden for individuals in remission that had not been previously       recognised.
This now underpins the NCSI and is driving a change in the       approach to care following initial cancer diagnosis and after successful       treatment which places greater emphasis on supporting recovery.
Professor       Corner chairs the self-management work stream in the NCSI and our research       [3.1, 3.2, 3.3] has demonstrated cancer survivors' need for information,       care and support for self-management.
This has led to the DH, Macmillan         Cancer Support and NHS [5.1, 5.5] focussing on the design       and implementation of supported self-management care models.
Data from the       Macmillan Health and Wellbeing Study [3.2] underpins the 2010 NCSI         Vision report [5.5] and studies by the Macmillan Survivorship       Research Group underpin the NCSI guidance issued in Living with and         beyond cancer: taking action to improve outcomes report [5.6].
Impact on funding bodies     The Macmillan Listening Study informed research priorities of national       cancer charities Macmillan Cancer Support and Breast Cancer         Campaign.
It resulted directly in Macmillan Cancer Support       establishing a User Led Research Grant Scheme which ran for four       consecutive years.
This provided funding for studies where patients,       caregivers and cancer survivors have an equal voice in deciding research       questions and approaches with researchers and clinicians [5.8].
The report       is cited in the Breast Cancer Campaign's gap analysis [5.13] indicating       the need for research to focus on the impact of cancer on everyday life.
International impact     Southampton's innovative research methods in which service users with       cancer co-led the Macmillan Listening Study has been highly influential       nationally [5.7] and internationally [5.2].
The methods used in the study       have been adopted in palliative care (Perkins et al., 2007) and Professor       Corner was a member of the advisory panel for the Australian National         Framework for Consumer Involvement in Cancer Control established by       the Australian Federal Government.
The framework report was published in       2011 and cited the study [5.3].
In addition, Professor Corner is Chair of       the Movember Foundation Survivorship Action Partnership Global       Advisory Committee.
Launched with funds of over $28 million, using the       model of supported self-management developed through the NCSI the Survivorship         Action Partnership is a global programme to develop networks in       Australia, Canada, UK and USA focussed on implementing innovation to       improve the lives of men living with prostate cancer.
