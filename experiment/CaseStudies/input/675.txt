     To facilitate the impact of KWILLT on policy and practice, creative,       applied outputs were developed (e.g.
DVDs, videos and e-learning       materials) based on KWILLT data and the segmentation model (Sources 1, 2       and 3).
The outputs are available on the KWILLT website (101030 hits at       31/7/2013).
The impact of KWILLT is rooted in its contribution to enhance       evidence through which to inform policy and practice related to avoidable       cold related illness and death.
The prime example of impact relates to the       Department of Health Cold Weather Plan (CWP).
The CWP called for NHS staff       and organisations, alongside collaborative institutions, to plan for       winter to avoid the negative impact of cold weather (Source 10).
This       requires identifying and assessing those at risk, alongside delivering       interventions including flu jabs, referral to affordable warmth schemes,       home improvement agencies and welfare and debt advice.
In addition, the       Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) is tasked with implementing       the Green Deal and Energy Company Obligation (ECO).
This places a premium       on identifying homes vulnerable to cold related harm and also householders       who would benefit from energy efficiency measures.
As KWILLT indicates,       those most at risk often do not access such policy initiatives.
KWILLT       findings and outputs have provided evidence to inform relevant       organisations on how to respond to the challenges and obligations laid       down in such policy.
Evidence of impacts is summarised below.
Influence in national policy was realised through the 2012/13         Department of Health Cold Weather Plan where it is recommended to         stakeholder groups as a toolkit for practice and cited as key evidence         (Souces 5, 6, 10).
Also the DECC Fuel Poverty Team has used the         electronic KWILLT outputs to increase understanding of factors         influencing older people to think about ways of overcoming these         barriers, and to stimulate thinking on how the DECC fuel poverty policy         and ECO reaches vulnerable householders (Email communication from Senior         Policy Advisor for Green Deal, DECC) (Source 9).
Impact has also been demonstrated through evidence contribution to         national consultations, primarily the Hills Fuel Poverty review (Source         7).
KWILLT informed the development of Winter Warmth England (WWE) (Source         3), this being a web based communications and information resource that         used KWILLT findings to develop the content and target audiences.
This         was supported by Department of Health Warm Homes: Warm Families funding         to facilitate delivery of the Cold Weather Plan.
How KWILLT findings         were used in practice are detailed in the WWE evaluation report (Source         4).
Examples include using KWILLT findings to develop and deliver clear,         consistent, accurate and accessible messages to staff and the public on         the health impact of cold and reducing health risk.
A number of national organisations have used KWILLT findings and         outputs for media, campaigns and training.
For example, National Energy         Action (NEA) used the findings within a national programme of seminars         for over 150 organisations involved in delivering on ECO, and a national         strategy seminar on Achieving Public Health Outcomes on Fuel Poverty and         Excess Winter Deaths (28 Feb 2013).
KWILLT highlighted the need for partnership and cross sector working         to overcome existing barriers to action.
KWILLT materials have         facilitated collaboration at a strategic and policy level such as local         Joint Strategic Needs Assessments, and also health and housing policies         in Local Authorities, for example Rotherham (Source 8).
Findings have         helped Local Government Yorkshire and Humber identify areas with         vulnerable populations and target interventions accordingly e.g.
flu         jabs and energy efficiency schemes such as Green Deal and ECO (Sources 4         and 8).
In public and policy debate at a local level KWILLT findings have been         used to discuss and influence local preparedness for winter, for example         at Local Area Assemblies.
Findings were presented at Local Area         Assemblies in Rotherham to inform local neighbourhood responses to the         Cold Weather Plan, e.g.
promoting neighbour checks on vulnerable         households.
At a national level this is evidenced by invitations to         present at two Department of Health seminars on the CWP, by the DECC         fuel poverty team, and other forums where key stakeholders discuss         organisational responses to current policy, e.g.
being an invited         speaker at the NEA Annual National Conferences (2009, 2011 &amp; 2012).
NEA also used the KWILLT pen portraits as materials for policy debate on         the introduction of the Green Deal and in their training events with MPs         and key stakeholders regarding implementation of the Green Deal         (December 2011).
Impact is illustrated through integration of KWILLT findings into         staff training, e.g.
in the NHS into Making Every Contact Count training         to health and social care staff, in Local Authorities into training with         housing department gas contractors and within the voluntary sector with         the training of volunteer Energy Champions (NEA).
Partnership         interventions such as South Yorkshire Hotspots have also used KWILLT         findings and outputs in their staff training.
Whilst it can be difficult to establish a direct influence of research         findings on practice, the impact of KWILLT on public health and NHS         staff practice is evidenced from the evaluation of the effectiveness of         the Winter Warmth England (WWE) web based Toolkit (Source 3), a resource         based on KWILLT findings.
An evaluation of WWE indicates the website had         10475 page views and 792 people have visited the Kwillt videos on WWE up         to February 2013 (Source 4. p7).
The evaluation provides examples of how         the KWILLT evidence was used to change practice including: helping         public health managers develop action plans for winter, informing         development of public campaign materials and public health         communications over winter, developing practice partnerships across         sectors, e.g.
housing, energy and health, deliver keeping warm         interventions, e.g.
Barnsley case study on p37 of the evaluation report.
This impact is reinforced by the CLAHRC-SY in their case study         collection (Source 8).
