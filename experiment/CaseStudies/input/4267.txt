     This case study describes the impact of research on bioadhesion and       biomaterials in the School of Pharmacy, QUB, which resulted in a new       product, Cohesive Paste&#8482;, being launched commercially by a leading stoma       care company.
Unlike competitors, Cohesive Paste&#8482; offers patients an       alcohol-free, `no sting' formulation particularly suitable for use on       damaged, excoriated skin.
Now sold in 26 countries, Cohesive&#8482; was launcheda       commercially in October 2007, with sales building from 2008 onwards to       more than &#163;1M to date.
Importantly, the product allowed the company to       provide a complete range of stomacare products (seals, pouches, adhesive       etc.)
under the `Cohesive' brand.
Operations for certain bowel conditions, e.g., inflammatory bowel disease       or cancers of the bowel, frequently involve the formation of a stoma, an       artificial opening in the bowel to either temporarily or permanently       divert the flow of faeces (ileostomy or a colostomy).
Unfortunately, a       complication associated with stomas is leakage of the bowel contents that,       amongst other issues, e.g., prolapse, hernia, results in high patient       morbidity.
The overall incidence of such complications ranges from 21-70%.
Leakage from the stoma is associated with pronounced skin irritation and       breakdown.
Cooperative funding from DTI and TG Eakin Ltd (a manufacturer       of stoma products sold worldwide) via a Knowledge Transfer Partnership       (KTP Scheme) led Jones and colleagues in the School of Pharmacy at Queen's       University Belfast to develop a novel bioadhesive product to address the       problems of leakage from the stoma.
Cohesive Pasteb is composed of a hydrophobic       viscoelastic matrix into which a range of hydrophilic bioadhesive polymers       of defined cross-link density and particle size is mechanically dispersed.
Upon contact with exudate, the product, based on the earlier periodontal       and related studies, is designed to control ingress of fluid into the       adhesive, to undergo swelling and to offer enhanced adhesion to the site       of attachment, thereby increasing wear time of the stoma device.
Furthermore, the hydrophilic components form a gel layer that interact       with the components of exudate and prevent these from contacting and       damaging the skin/stoma interface.
The design of the novel stoma adhesive       involved complex rheological characterisation of viscoelastic and       bioadhesive properties using the experience and knowledge gained in       earlier underpinning research.
The impact is on the expansion of the company (sales and profitability)       and, importantly, on stoma patients, who benefit from the use of the       product through a decreased incidence of skin irritation and breakdownc.
A nurse testimoniald states that `The Eakin Cohesive         Paste&#8482; also increases the wear time of Eakin Wound Pouches by         adding extra security and protecting the skin from faecal fluid         contamination.
This technique works well on both fistula and wound         management.
The paste does not break down over prolonged use, expanding         the wear time of wound pouches to 5-7 days.
The paste is easily removed         when changing pouches and does not leave a residue on the skin'.
In 2007, the KTP schemee between Eakin and the School       of Pharmacy, which resulted in `Cohesive Paste&#8482;', won a KTP Awardf       from the Technology Strategy Board.
Indicating the commercial impact, the       company said that they considered the partnership to have been `an       enormous success in developing an entirely new product'.
Cohesive Paste&#8482;       is now sold in some 26 countries with sales of more than &#163;1M to dateg.
Confirming the beneficial impact on patients and healthcare professionals,       in November 2010 TG Eakin Ltd received the Gold Prizeh       in the `Continence and Stoma Care' category of the `Nursing Times Product       Awards' in London for the `highly innovative Cohesive Paste&#8482;'       which, the judges felt, `transformed patient care, helping healthcare         professionals work efficiently'.
