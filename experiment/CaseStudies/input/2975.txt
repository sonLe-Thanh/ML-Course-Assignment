     Pathways to Impact: Prior to the first conference in 1991, there       had been little research on the role and work of NGOs in development.
The       only significant international event had been organised in 1987 by the       Overseas Development Institute, a non-profit think tank, and primarily       involved development assistance agencies.
The IDPM initiative, led by       Professor David Hulme alongside Michael Edwards from Save the Children       Fund, catalysed knowledge and scholarship and involved many more NGOs and       researchers.
Further conferences broadened the scope to the wider domain       of civil society, leading to multiple impacts on non-academic users, and       recognition by development agencies and the NGO sector itself       (collectively and within individual organizations), alongside other groups       and individuals.
The primary pathways for this impact have been:       participation in events and debates, longstanding relationships between       UoM researchers and civil society organizations and written documentation.
Key impacts, which encompass a noted effect on organisational       performance, can be grouped into three areas: a more aware and reflective       NGO sector; an improved understanding of the sector amongst wider       stakeholders; and new tools and methods for NGOs.
To evaluate       these impacts, IDPM commissioned an independent study, undertaken by an       authoritative, senior and widely respected expert in the field (with       public honours in Canada), whose report concluded that: "In terms of         their reach, the significance of the ideas propagated and the depth of         their influence, the four IDPM conferences and the associated volumes         represent a distinct and material contribution to the work and effort of         international development NGOs....an important response to         over-theorization and the need for more practical discourse" [1].
Deeper reflection and understanding: The work of IDPM staff has       resulted in a more knowledgeable, prepared and reflective sector, with       knowledge emerging from both exposure to different perspectives through       participation in conferences, and influence on a generation of       practitioners via written texts.
As a senior Bangladeshi NGO manager       notes: "IDPM's key success was as a convening platform", with       another senior practitioner-academic stating that: "I don't know of any         other body of work that framed the debate in the way those conferences         did" [1].
These debates provided an important resource for many       individuals.
The former director of the Ford Foundation (Governance &amp;       Civil Society Programme), and a world-leading authority, exemplifies this,       stating that: "I have observed the benefits on both the NGO sector         itself (collectively and in individual organizations) and other groups         and individuals, including beneficiaries and development agencies"       [2] and noting in the Smillie report that "IDPM's work has been `a         fundamentally important launch pad for things I've done in my         professional and intellectual life'"[1].
Several interviewees       highlighted the particular value of the texts that emerged from IDPM's       work, a senior Indian NGO manager and regional sector expert arguing that:       "This was precisely the divide that needed to be bridged... `How-to'         manuals don't do it and the heavy academic papers&#8212;who reads that stuff?
I still photocopy some of the articles for new staff to read" [1].
Moreover, the significant impact of the research on the scale and depth of       reflection in the sector can be exemplified with respect to the particular       themes.
For example, two key NGO practitioners (Jacobs and Wilford) argue       that "Edwards and Hulme framed the debate on NGO accountability"       [1]; the World Bank acknowledging the significance of Edwards and Hulme's       work in the concept and significance of downward accountability for NGOs;       and the Commonwealth Foundation highlighting accountability as a key issue       facing the NGO sector within a series of on-line forums in 2010, with the       background paper drawing extensively on this work, specifically [E][3].
Evidence of IDPM's continuing capacity to catalyse debate and challenge       thinking in and about the sector is provided by the discussion following a       Brooks World Poverty Institute (BWPI) paper published at UoM, which built       on earlier IDPM analysis with an updated and critical analysis of trends.
Duncan Green, Senior Strategic Advisor at Oxfam (GB) responded in his       widely followed blog, receiving 45 replies in the following four weeks,       with reference to earlier IDPM publications [4].
Mark Tran, who writes a       `Poverty Matters' blog for The Guardian newspaper contributed to the       debate, himself eliciting 16 comments in the five days afterwards.
Very       specific engagements can also be noted, with contributions towards a       deeper reflection on governance issues across civil society and the state       provided by Bebbington's recent work with the Ministry of Environment in       El Salvador.
This work builds on the collaborative research with PRISMA       [C] and has "assisted in the formulation of a proposed new national         policy and associated legislation on mining, as well as in the         formulation of environmental governance strategy within the Ministry of         Environment" [5].
Improved understanding of the sector leading to more effective         development work: A Dutch NGO senior manager with HIVOS cites the       monograph emerging out of the fourth IDPM conference as one of the best       books available to him, as he sought to address significant questions       facing his NGO [1].
Further evidence of the contribution of IDPM's work is       provided by BOND (the UK network of development NGOs) who list reference       [E] (above) as a key `library resource'.
Similarly [D] was selected by       Palgrave MacMillan as one of eight titles republished to celebrate the       30th anniversary of their International Political Economy series.
As       Palgrave confirm, the book "was the first that we chose... the most         successful title in the series' history... clearly a great influence in         its field" [6].
At a wider scale, the United Nations Research       Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) cite IDPM research in their       flagship 2010 publication, in analyses of NGO contributions to formulating       and implementing poverty reduction policies.
UNRISD also contracted       Bebbington to analyse the role of social movements in poverty reduction       activities, with Bebbington drawing heavily on IDPM's work in his report       [7].
In addition, Hulme's research has been utilised by the Bangladeshi       NGO BRAC (assisting 126 million people) in the formulation of its       strategies.
As noted by their former research coordinator "evolving         from a critique of mainstream approaches such as microfinance,       [Hulme] has helped BRAC develop a programme to work with the         `ultra-poor' that reaches the lowest-income households with &#163;500 million         in aid finance... More generally... IDPM... has been helpful to BRAC in         contributing to their strategic analysis of the role of NGOs in         development" [8].
This co-learning approach, between Hulme and UoM       colleagues and BRAC, has been further developed within subsequent research       financed by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) amongst       others.
New methods and tools: The impact of work on NGO         accountability has been enhanced by the crafting of novel approaches       that draw on IDPM's analysis.
Since the mid-1990s NGOs have initiated       self-regulatory frameworks such as One World Trust's `Global       Accountability Report', with impact ongoing.
The One World Trust states       that the rise of such frameworks is a response to IDPM work.
An example of       further impact is provided by two international NGOs &#8212; Concern and Mango &#8212;       whose project `Listen First', introduced systematic approaches for       managing downward accountability; trials involved six countries and more       than 530 staff and advisers [A][9].
Finally, the protection of civil society autonomy has been taken       up through Mitlin's work with Shack/Slum Dwellers International (SDI) to       strategize the development of their Urban Poor Fund International &#8212; a       multi-million dollar basket fund supported by bilateral development       assistance from Norway and Sweden, with contributions from the Bill and       Melinda Gates Foundation.
The aim is to address the needs of the landless       urban poor in over 20 countries, supporting local women's led savings       schemes, thus addressing the needs of thousands of their members for       tenure, security and access to basic services.
This has drawn on IDPM       research to manage and exploit opportunities provided at the global level,       supporting alternative modalities of development assistance that recognise       the need to empower and capacitate grassroots organisations and their       members.
As SDI have confirmed to Mitlin: "your work and that of         others at the University of Manchester has challenged the NGO sector to         think about their relations with grassroots organisations and the         political strategies that are likely to be successful in achieving         social justice and equity in towns and cities of the global south"       [10].
