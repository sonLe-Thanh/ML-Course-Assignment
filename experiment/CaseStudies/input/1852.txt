     The impact that has been generated by Dunstan's research includes: an       increase in the commercial competitiveness of Renishaw plc resulting from       his innovations to their inVia microscope range, allowing them to become       the market leaders in Raman spectroscopy; the development of new analysis       techniques in pharmaceuticals quality control; commercial contracts and       revenues won by the SME Absolute Action Ltd between 2008/13 arising from       consultancy work undertaken by Dunstan; cultural impact and improvements       in the quality of life for the general public through innovative lighting       of public displays; and enhanced sustainability of public museums through       increased visitor numbers.
Improvements to the Raman microscope give Renishaw plc competitive         advantage       Between 1996-2002, Dunstan developed the numerous improvements to the       Renishaw Raman microscope described in section 2.
Renishaw incorporated       these into their new inVia range of Raman microscopes, with the       Near-eXcitation-Tuneable (NeXT) filter being the primary innovation.
The       Design Manager in Renishaw's Spectroscopy Products Division writes: "...         Renishaw started collaborating with Prof Dunstan at Queen Mary on the         development of a number of modifications to the Raman microscope which         were incorporated into the design of the inVia system" [1].
The design of the NeXT filter in particular has given Renishaw a distinct       competitive edge, and the inVia Raman microscope has become the world's       best selling research Raman system.
According to the Design Manager at       Renishaw the NeXT filter has enabled them "to become market leaders in         the area of low wavenumber Raman microscopy" [1].
Raman spectroscopy       is "the predominant income source" in Renishaw's healthcare       section, which contributed &#163;29m to their revenue in 2013.
This is a       rapidly growing area for the company with 11 percent growth since 2012 [1,       6].
Their main competitor in the field of Raman microscopes, Horiba, use a       triple spectrometer coupled to their microscope to achieve similar       performance.
As has been stated by the Science &amp; Technology Lead at       AstraZeneca plc, the NeXT filter had: "the distinct advantage over         triple monochromators of lower cost and vastly increased throughput.
It         was a major step forward giving industrial labs access to a         traditionally difficult spectroscopic region.
It was routine, relatively         easy to maintain and provided invaluable insight into polymorph         structure and formulation behaviour including polymorph stability."
[2].
New industrial and pharmaceutical applications       The introduction of the NeXT filter has allowed for the development of new       industrial applications of Raman spectroscopy using the inVia microscope.
The Design Manager at Renishaw writes: "This filter ... has allowed us         to expand our sales into new areas, such as polymorph screening in         pharmaceuticals, graphene and related carbon materials" and "...the         development of the NeXT filter has provided our customers with a         powerful high-throughput technique that has benefitted their         industries."
[1].
The Science &amp; Technology Lead at AstraZeneca       states: "Prior to the introduction of the NeXT filter, the challenges         from an industrial perspective largely resulted from limitations in the         capability of the instrumentation and not the science.
The NeXT         technology opened up opportunities for solving industrial problems         needing a solution from low frequency mode measurements."
[2].
One       particularly important use of the NeXT filter has been in the       pharmaceutical industry, where: "These low frequency modes were         invaluable in supporting the characterisation of drug polymorphs and         formulations.
They helped define both the properties of these polymorphs         and their behaviour.
To address the challenge of probing this spectral         region, I evaluated industrialized and research solutions in Fourier         Transform far-infrared, Terahertz and Raman spectroscopies.
The two         former were shown to be of limited value.
Raman spectroscopy clearly was         the technology of choice."
[2].
A considerable amount of research has been undertaken into drug       polymorphism by the pharmaceutical industry &#8212; partly because polymorphs       (different structural forms of a given molecule) are patentable, and this       can have advantages for industry in extending the patent lifetime of the       drug, but also because of the risk polymorphism poses to the effectiveness       of a drug.
According to the Chief Scientific officer at pharmaceutical       research company SAFC-Pharmorphix: "The worst that can happen for a         pharmaceutical company is if a new polymorph suddenly appears in the         temperature and humidity conditions of a blister-pack when a compound is         actually on the market" [7].
This is because new polymorphs can       alter the bioactivity of a drug, for example through changes in       solubility.
A number of techniques have been used to study polymorphism       such as X-ray diffraction and optical spectroscopy, but given that       polymorphs can be formed by subtle changes in crystallisation due to       solvent, temperature, cooling rates, etc, there is an active market in       high throughput characterisation techniques.
Attempts have been made to       use other techniques such as FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) and       Terahertz spectroscopy, but these have proved ineffective and the       introduction of the NeXT filter to Raman microscopes added significant       value as the low frequency modes "helped define both the properties of         these polymorphs and their behaviour."
[2].
This was in part due to       the fact that "it was routine" and "relatively easy to maintain"       [2], but also the removal of a large scanning triple spectrometer meant       that spectra can be collected on a CCD array with fast integration times       (due to the higher light throughput).
"It was a major step forward         giving industrial labs access to a traditionally difficult spectroscopic         region."
[2]     Optical-engineering gives Absolute Action Ltd a competitive edge       Dunstan began his consultancy with Absolute Action Ltd in 1996/97 when       they approached him with the challenge of illuminating the Hope Diamond in       the Smithsonian, which is often quoted as being the most viewed museum       artefact in the world.
The diamond is set in a ring of brilliant white       diamonds and visitors were frequently disappointed because the original       lighting caught the white diamonds so much that the blue diamond appeared       dull in comparison.
Dunstan used his research expertise in       optical-engineering, developed through his experimental research in       coupling samples contained in Diamond Anvil Cells to the Renishaw       microscope, to design a lighting system that used fibre-fed imaging optics       coupled with a graticule to provide as much light as possible on the Hope       Diamond while minimising the light level on the surrounding diamonds.
This       resulted in the current display where the Hope Diamond "sparkles, dazzles       and glows" [The Times, reference 8].
The curator of the National       Gem and Mineral collection at the Smithsonian stated that: "annual         viewing figures since 2008 have been approximately 5 million, compared         to only about 3 million before this lighting was installed" [3].
In 2003 Dunstan designed the lighting for the Memorial to       Japanese-American Patriotism and the lighting system that illuminates the       paintings in the British Embassy in Paris.
The key knowledge transfer from       the experimental research was developing the ability to place light, at       whatever intensity or colour and at whatever place, with whatever       variation over time, that may be desired by a lighting designer or client.
The design rules and computer software developed by Dunstan to achieve       this were given to Absolute Action Ltd, allowing them to use this       technology in many subsequent contracts [4].
This has given Absolute Action Ltd a distinct competitive edge.
Although       there is no IPR protection or patentable technology in the designs Dunstan       has given the company, the know-how and confidence to tender for       commissions that competitors cannot meet has led to many top-end contracts       and a very strong reputation.
Absolute Action Ltd states that this       technology "enables us to secure projects of elevated intrinsic value,         to satisfy the kind of clients who will come back for more, and to         reinforce our Company's status as providers of unique services in         high-profile projects."
[4].
They estimate that these high value       projects have accounted for ~&#163;1m in revenue since 2008, which is "not         an insignificant contribution to the commercial health of a small entity         such as we are".
It has also "elevated our company to the status         of Lighting Specialists of Choice for some of the Smithsonian         Institution's most vaunted exhibitions- including inter alia the         illumination of the Dresden Green Diamond, the Wonder of Pearls         exhibition and the Fancy Diamonds Exhibit."
This status and the       reputation that goes with it helps them to continue to secure high       prestige projects such as illuminating the exclusive Carnet jewellery       store in Hong Kong and Carnet exhibition in London (2010), and a       commission from Foster &amp; Partners to illuminate Buddhist sculptures in       the Kamakura private residence in Japan (2010).
Bespoke lighting design       companies who have partnered Absolute Action Ltd have also received       commercial benefit through utilisation of these technologies [5].
Museums and art galleries       The impact of this work is currently on display around the world in both       public and private permanent collections.
The initial work on the Hope       Diamond has led to a number of contracts for exhibitions.
For example, the       Vault at the Natural History Museum in London displays the institution's       most valuable collection of gemstones and minerals in a permanent exhibit.
The approach is being increasingly used in art galleries where there is a       need to have very discrete luminaires which place light (with no damaging       UV component) solely onto the artwork to be displayed.
By removing the       light overspill the painting or sculpture appears to stand out from the       background, greatly enhancing the impact on the viewer.
This technology       has now been used for displaying artwork in locations as varied as       Cliveden, The Van Loon Museum in Amsterdam and The Garrick Club in London,       as well as the British Embassy in Paris.
Secondary impact is generated by the enhanced viewing experience of the       public provided by these lighting systems.
The resulting cultural capital       leads to improvements in the quality of life.
The increased interest and       engagement of the general public has a positive impact on the       sustainability of public museums through increased visitor numbers, as       evidenced by the increase from three to five million visitors to the Hope       Diamond after the new lighting was installed [3].
