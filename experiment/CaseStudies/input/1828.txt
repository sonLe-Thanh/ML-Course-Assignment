     Sullivan's research has effectively challenged the increasing consensus       that the `financialisation of nature' is a way of addressing environmental       problems, and has provided a widely used source of information and       argument for critics campaigning against this approach.
Sullivan's       conference presentation at Lund University, Sweden in May 2010, published       on the conference website and subsequently as `Banking nature?'
(ref.
1), was quickly syndicated to environmental policy and advocacy       websites.
On Sullivan's own website alone it has been viewed 1,195 times       since June 2010.
Since the Lund conference, Sullivan's research has steadily filtered       into, and informed discussions on, `the financialisation of nature' among       campaigners and policy advisers, as evidenced in links to the conference       paper from a number of policy and advocacy websites (source 1).
The       paper became a focus for online discussion facilitated by the Capital       Institute on the theme `Can nature be monetized?'.
Participants       included renowned policy advisors on market-based approaches to       environmental management, such as: the head of the EU/UN programme on The       Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB), Pavan Sukhdev; ecological       economist, Robert Costanza; and the President and CEO of Ethical Markets       Media, economist Hazel Henderson (source 2).
In addition, the       campaign website Just Conservation, which Sullivan helped set up,       is cited by policy and popular forums, including International Union for       Conservation of Nature, Samburuwatch, and Stop Thomson Safaris (source         3).
The research-based site for students of environmentalism,       biodiversity and conservation, Studying Green, established by       Sullivan and colleagues in October 2011, has received 17,451 views, with       an essay by Sullivan, `Going Beyond `the Money Shot' receiving one       of the highest number of views (933) (source 4).
Sullivan's work is increasingly used as a source of material for critical       thinking about the `financialisation of nature' as a form of environmental       management.
In March 2012, she was one of a small number of academics to       be invited to participate in a high-level policy Dialogue Seminar on       `Biodiversity and Finance' in Quito, Ecuador, run by the Secretariat for       the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and partners and involving       several hundred policy makers from around the world.
Organised to inform       the international policy process for the CBD, the seminar brought together       a range of international participants including: government negotiators;       representatives of key financial organisations such as the World Bank; and       representatives of international advocacy organisations, including the       Third World Network (TWN).
Sullivan's Banking Nature?
article       (ref.
1) and other academic work, were amongst the texts selected by the       conference organisers to inform policy debate and awareness in this area (source         5).
The TWN then invited Sullivan to write a booklet, `Financialisation,         biodiversity conservation and equity' about financing mechanisms in       environmental policy (source 6).
This has been available online       since June 2012 and downloaded 1,891 times (as of 31 July 2013), and the       TWN has also translated a summary of the booklet into Spanish to make it       available to South American audiences.
Some 480 copies have been       distributed by the TWN at international environmental policy-making       meetings including:            to stakeholders at major international environmental meetings leading         up to the Rio+20 Earth Summit in June 2012;       at working group meetings of the United Nations Framework           Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (e.g.
the Bonn UNFCCC           Climate Change Conference, May 2012);       at UN CBD meetings (including at the 4th Ad Hoc Open-Ended           Working Group on Review of Implementation of the Convention (WGRI)         in Montreal, May 2012);       and at NGO strategy meetings on finance and development.
Subsequently, the booklet has been referred to in a United Nations CBD       Discussion Paper, Safeguards for Scaling-up Biodiversity Finance and         Possible Guiding Principles, for the 11th Conference of Parties to       the UN CBD in Hyderabad, October 2012.
It is also listed as one of four       sources of `knowledge and reflections on the subject of the       financialization of nature' in a special issue (#181, August 2012) of the       World Rainforest Movement newsletter on the `financialisation of nature'       (reproduced at Climate Connections, the blog of the Global Ecology       Justice Project) (source 7).
Sullivan's contribution to the understanding of market-based approaches       to biodiversity conservation has also been recognised and reinforced by       the environmental think-tank, the Green House, which commissioned her to       write a policy report (co-authored with Dr Mike Hannis, editor of The         Land Magazine) on DEFRA's biodiversity offsetting policy: Offsetting         Nature?
Habitat Banking and Biodiversity Offsets in the English Land Use         Planning System (Dorset: Green House 2012) (source 8).
This       report has received many media citations, including as the first item of       the `Conservation News' section of British Wildlife Magazine       (24(1) 10/2012) and in The ENDS Report (the online professional       journal for environmental policy and business, no 459, May 2013).
Consequently, Sullivan was interviewed as an expert informant in the       preparation of a UK Parliamentary Office for Science and Technology policy       briefing POSTnote on biodiversity offsetting and planning (October       2012) which references her work (source 9).
Recognition of Sullivan's expertise in relation to the development of new       markets in units of biodiversity conservation is evident in the interest       in her research among broadcast and press journalists, including in British         Wildlife Magazine, The Ends Report and Yale Environment         360.
She has been interviewed for an episode on carbon trading in       the Costing the Earth series, BBC Radio 4 (broadcast 17 March       2011), and acted as an advisor for Channel 4's Dispatches on       `Conservation's Dirty Secrets' (broadcast 20 June 2011).
Most recently the impact of Sullivan's research is evidenced by an       invitation from the UN Secretariat for the Convention on Biological       Diversity and the Norwegian Government (Directorate for Nature Management)       to speak on a high-level plenary panel on Trade-Offs in National         Policies at the 7th Trondheim Conference on Biodiversity       (May 2013), to an audience of around 300 (source 10).
This       invitation-only event was directed at policymakers and experts in       biodiversity and economic planning.
As an indication of the standing of       this invitation, other panel members included Sir Robert Watson, Co-Chair       of the UK National Ecosystem Assessment, Pavan Sukhdev, leader of the UN       programme on The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity, and senior       officials from the World Bank, UNDP, OECD and the environmental ministries       of Bolivia and Guatemala.
Since then, and following publication of a blog       piece for the academic Public Political Ecology Lab (March 2013),       the continuation of Sullivan's research impact is demonstrated by an       invitation to write for the public blog of the international policy       network, the Green Economy Coalition (with 36 tweets from this site since       publication in July 2013) (source 11).
