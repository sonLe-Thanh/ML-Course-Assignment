     This research has significant social impact through improving the       provision of telephone helpline       support to vulnerable groups.
There are three beneficiaries: helpline       managers (whose       organisations have benefitted from expert consultation), helpline       operators (whose awareness,       skills, and practices have improved), and callers themselves whose needs       are better understood       and met.
The further potential reach of the research impact is extensive &#8212;       in addition to the       helplines the researchers have worked with directly, the 450 or so       helplines accredited by the       researchers' association with Helpline Partnership, each receive training       that will in future be       informed by the research, and collectively they receive 29 million calls       per year.
The impact of the work has been achieved through (a) engagement, (b)       research-based training,       and (c) consultancy and evaluation.
These activities have changed       awareness, improved call-takers'       skills, and led to improvements in helpline policies and practices [5.1-5.7].
(a) Engagement has resulted in increased awareness and understanding     By sharing the research findings (as described in section 2) with       helplines the researchers have       increased awareness of the interactional patterns and practices of       helpline calls.
Helpline       managers and call-takers have greater understanding about handling strong       emotions [3.4, 5.1,         5.2, 5.3], how advice can be given in non-directive ways [3.2,         3.3] [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4], and how       ethically sensitive issues can be managed [5.4, 5.5].
In 2009, research on using questions in advice delivery [3.2]       were shared with Kids Helpline staff.
The presentation and discussion enhanced attendees' understanding about       how the organisation's       policy of non-directive advice was handled through questioning techniques       [5.8].
In June 2010, LUHRU's research was discussed at a Knowledge Exchange         Workshop on         Telephone Helplines at Edinburgh University.
This led to the       delivery of a workshop for Parenting         Across Scotland (PAS - a partnership of organisations supporting       families, including Parentline       Scotland, Lone Parent Helpline, and Stepfamily Scotland) in May 2012 [5.2].
Participating call-takers       and helpline managers reported that the workshop increased their       understanding about       ways of handling strong emotion [3.4] and advice-giving [3.2,         3.3] [5.3, 5.4].
Between 2002 and 2004, Hepburn worked intensively with the Duty Manager       at NSPCC to discuss       the research findings, offering support and advice to individual       practitioners and reporting findings       to team meetings.
Participants said that these activities had raised       awareness of call openings and       dealing with upset callers [5.1, 5.2].
A bespoke workshop delivered in November 2012 raised NSPCC call-takers'       awareness of how       callers display emotion, and how to handle advice resistance [5.1].
During 2012 and 2013,       individual meetings with call-takers from Compassion in Dying have       resulted in increased       understanding of advice giving [3.2, 3.3] in relation to complex       medical and legal issues.
A formal       evaluation of the service has also increased awareness and understanding       of how call-takers can       best support callers [5.4, 5.5]               (b) Research-based training and guidance has enhanced the continuing         professional         development of helpline practitioners     Workshop participants listen to calls the researchers have analysed and       are taught how to       consider the consequences of different ways of handling various       interactional issues [5.1, 5.2, 5.3,         5.4, 5.5].
They have reported that as well as increasing awareness       of issues around emotion and       advice-giving, the workshops led to changes in their techniques [5.1,         5.2, 5.3, 5.4].
For instance,       participants at the Parenting Across Scotland workshop said that the       workshop improved their       practices by `Helping me consider my responses', `Thinking about how to       deal with calls more       effectively and efficiently' and `Considering how to conduct calls more       proactively'.
The significance of LUHRU for continuing professional development has       been recognised by the       national accrediting body for helplines &#8212; the Helplines Partnership       (formerly the Telephone       Helplines Association) who have entered into partnership with LUHRU [5.6,         5.7].
(c) Consultancy and expert advice has led to changes in helpline         policies and practices     The effectiveness of LUHRU's research and training has led to the group       being invited to offer       consultancy and expert advice, and to evaluate helpline services [5.1,         5.4].
Outcomes of these         activities include improved service documents and standardisation of         call-taking strategies.
In July 2012, NSPCC asked Hepburn and Potter to examine a `failed call'       which resulted in suicide.
The report was used to support quality control and feed into managerial       decisions about how to       handle similar calls in the future [5.1].
In 2012, Wilkinson was asked to evaluate Compassion in Dying's       End-of-Life Rights Information       Line.
A report, based on analysis of 200+ calls, advised how the service       could improve.
Recommendations led to changes in service policy and practice, including       improvements to       documents used by call-takers, changes in the way call-takers discuss       issues with legal       implications, and improved call monitoring [5.4] The report also         provided an evidence base         which the charity has drawn on in its outreach and policy-making         activities [5.5].
