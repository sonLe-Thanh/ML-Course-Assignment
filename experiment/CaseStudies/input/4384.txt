     Arnull's work has had impact on EU primary and secondary law and the       evolution of case law.
It has been of benefit to businesses and       individuals affected by EU measures through helping to secure access to       justice and effective dispute resolution.
Because this reinforces the rule       of law, it has also been of benefit to the EU itself since this is one of       the values on which it is founded.
The ECJ's case law on standing came under renewed attack in the 1990s by       Arnull and other scholars, some of whom were cited alongside Arnull by AG       Stix-Hackl in Case C-312/00 P Commission v Camar [2002] ECR       I-11355, 11371 (n.15).
Arnull's 1995 and 2001 articles (R1 and R3), as       well as the book chapter published in 2000 (R2), were cited in UPA       by AG Jacobs, one of the ECJ's longest-serving and most influential       Advocates General.
He described Arnull's 2001 article as `one of the       fullest and most authoritative recent studies' on the subject (para 100 of       the Opinion).
The ECJ's decision in that case led to discussion in the       Convention on the Future of Europe on whether (and if so how) the standing       rules should be changed.
A provision having that effect was included in       the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe.
Following the failure       of that Treaty, the provision concerned was incorporated in the Treaty on       the Functioning of the EU, which took effect on 1 December 2009.
The       relevant paragraph had never previously been amended.
The General Court       acknowledged that the new provision `pursues an objective of opening up       the conditions for bringing direct actions...' (Case T-262/10 Microban         v Commission, judgment of 25 October 2011, para 32).
However, in       Case C-583/11 P Inuit and Others v European Parliament and Council,       judgment of 3 October 2013, the Court of Justice construed the new       provision narrowly.
Its judgment is likely to attract criticism from       academics and legal practitioners and lead to pressure for further reform.
Arnull's work on the EU's court structure prompted an invitation in 2010       to submit evidence (both written and oral) on the workload of the ECJ to       the House of Lords EU Committee.
His evidence was cited extensively in         the Committee's report, The Workload of the Court of Justice of         the European Union, published on 6 April 2011 (see source 1 below).
The Committee endorsed Arnull's view that the relationship between the ECJ       and the national courts should be safeguarded (written evidence, para 21;       report, para 108) and that access to the case law in a language that all       EU citizens could understand reinforced the legitimacy of both the ECJ and       the General Court (oral evidence, QQ 15-19; report, para 68).
The       Committee agreed with Arnull that the Member States and the other       institutions should be receptive when the ECJ suggested changes to its       procedural rules (oral evidence, Q 35; report, para 91).
Following a       suggestion by Arnull (written evidence, para 14) and other witnesses, the       Committee recommended an increase in the number of Judges of the General       Court (report, para 136).
The Committee's report was welcomed by the British Government (source 2)       and the European Commission (source 3).
The report was debated in the       House of Lords on 17 October 2011 (source 4).
The Committee visited the Union Courts in November 2010 and received       evidence from a number of members.
On 28 March 2011, the ECJ submitted to       the European Parliament and the Council under Article 281 TFEU a package       of requests, including one for an increase in the number of Judges of the       General Court.
The European Parliament and the Council gave partial effect       to those proposals in August 2012 with the adoption of Regulation 741/2012       (source 5).
They acknowledged the `continuing need to tackle delays       arising from the heavy workload of the General Court' (see preamble,       Regulation 741/2012), but by the end of 2012 it was apparent that       agreement on increasing the number of Judges was some way off.
The Committee therefore decided to conduct a follow-up enquiry and sought       the views of the witnesses to the original enquiry on intervening       developments.
In February 2013, Arnull submitted a response suggesting a       more economical way in which the problem might be resolved, and arguing       that there was a compelling case for increasing the number of Advocates       General in the ECJ.
In its report published on 29 April 2013, the       Committee rejected the first suggestion (source 6, para 69) but       acknowledged that it had some support in the UK Government and other       Member States (paras 14 and 17).
The Committee endorsed several other         points made by Arnull and quoted figures he had supplied on cases       concerning the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (paras 44 and 45).
It       recommended that the Government should support an increase in the number       of Advocates General (paras 48-51).
On 25 June 2013, the Council         adopted a decision increasing the number of Advocates General from       eight to nine in July 2013 and then to eleven in October 2015 (source 7).
Progress in other areas depends on the Member States.
The work described here is therefore shaping developments at case law,       legislative and Treaty level.
It is helping to reinforce access to justice       for all natural and legal persons and contributing to improvements in the       governance of the EU through its influence on the EU's evolving mechanisms       of dispute resolution.
This is of direct benefit to individuals and         businesses because of the extent to which Union law may affect their         rights and obligations.
