     Western military training on ethics has over recent years been influenced       by the revisionist school.
As part of that school, Rodin's research and       his direct involvement in military teaching and policy consultation have       affected the training of military officers and senior civil servants       across the US, UK and beyond and begun to inform changes in military       doctrine.
(1) Changing military thinking and training regarding the ethics of           war     Rodin's contributions to revisionist Just War Theory have been       incorporated into the teaching of military ethics at military academies       throughout the world.
`War and Self-Defense' [R1], and       other works by Rodin are being used in military ethics courses at West       Point (the United States Military Academy), the US Naval Postgraduate       School, the UK Defence Academy, and the Australian Defence Academy.
Students at these academies range from cadets to elite officers and future       military leaders.
For example:     (a) United States: Military Academy staff at West Point       report that their thinking about military ethics has shifted substantially       and attribute significant credit for this shift to Rodin's research as       part of the revisionist school [R1, R2, R4].
West Point now places       greater importance on human rights as the foundation for both the theory       and the legitimization of the use of force in military operations.
West       Point staff confirm the influence of Rodin's research on faculty, the       curriculum and courses in ethics and Just War Theory [C1].
At West Point alone, the training of 6,000 American Army Officers over the       last five years has included Rodin's ideas and reconceptualization of Just         War Theory, changing fundamentally the teaching on the morality of       killing in war [C1].
Rodin's research has had similar impact on       military ethics courses taught by the US Naval Postgraduate School to       officers across all branches of the US military - Army, Navy, Air Force       and Marines - as well as officers from militaries the world over.

(b) United Kingdom: As a result of his work on the ethics       of war, Rodin was invited by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) to contribute       to the teaching of ethics at the UK Defence Academy.
Since 2002, Rodin has       taught on the ethics component of broader courses at the Academy,       introducing insights from his research into each.
The element on ethics is       considered vital to the broader learning and understanding needed by       operational commanders.
He has taught on the:             Advanced Command Staff Course, which serves an international         cohort of approximately 300 mid-career officers a year (2002-present);        Higher Command and Staff Course, a selective course aimed at         Colonels and attended by around 25 (2-3%) of officers each year         (2004-2006, since 2006 the HCSC cohort are included within the         Defence Strategic Leadership Programme ethics component) [C3].
Defence Strategic Leadership Programme (DSLP), which is         mandatory for all military officers promoted to 1 star rank (Brigadier)         (2004-present);        Collaborative Strategic Leadership Programme (CSLP) - similar         to the DSLP for equivalent rank personnel from the Foreign Office, MOD         and other government departments, serving around 85 officers and civil         servants a year (2010 and 2011).
Rodin's research on the ethics of war has informed his design and       teaching of ethics modules [C3].
His work [R1, R4 and other         publications] is included in Defence Academy (Joint Services Command       &amp; Staff College) reading lists for Military Ethics and Just War.
Between 2008 and 2013 Rodin's research has made a contribution to the way       some 2,000 senior military officers and civil servants understand moral       choices in war.
(2) Contributing to changes in military doctrine and practice       Rodin's research has also contributed to changes in military doctrine and       practice:     (a) United States: As a result of his work on morality in       war, Rodin participated in the inaugural conference for a major review of       the US Army's Professional Military Ethic, and was invited in 2009 to act       as a consultant to General Dempsey the then Commanding General for the US       Army's Training and Doctrine Command to assist in the preparation of a US       Army White Paper.
Rodin facilitated a meeting for the core West Point       drafting team at the Oxford Institute for Ethics Law and Armed Conflict       (Summer 2010) at which a number of invited UK academics examined the       emerging text in detail.
Rodin's research and influence are described as       "decisive" [C4] in including an explicit statement in the White       Paper that the ethic of the US Army must derive from human rights and that       the US Army's actions and policies are subject to this moral construct.
This statement represents a significant change in the US Army's approach       to ethics [C4].
The resulting White Paper, The Profession of         Arms, was published by General Dempsey (by then promoted to 37th       Chief of Staff) in December 2010.
The Paper cites Rodin's article Justifying         Harm [R6] in the section on the principles that govern the       use of force (p.14) [C5].
The White Paper is described as the key document in the process that led       to a new Army Doctrine Publication (ADP 1), the capstone mandatory       training manual in the US doctrinal system [C4].
The White Paper       also served as a foundational document for a year-long US Army initiative       on The Profession of Arms in 2012, which included a series of       workshops with senior staff specifically on the impact of a Human Rights       based ethic on US Army operations, including one with a Brigade Combat       Team recently returned from Afghanistan [C4].
(b) United Kingdom: Rodin's contributions to revisionist Just         War Theory have also shaped the approach of the British Armed       Forces.
In 2010 and 2011, the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed       Conflict (under the joint leadership of Rodin and others) partnered with       the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and the International Law Department of the       British Red Cross to host two conferences on Military Ethics for the UK       defence community.
The purpose of these meetings was to bring together       senior leaders in the MOD and other government departments with academics       to raise awareness of the challenges of ethically-aware decision-making at       operational and strategic levels, and to establish the need for new or       revised military doctrine.
Reports from the event acknowledge the growing       importance of the ethical dimension of military operations, the risks       associated with ethical failure, and the opportunities to learn from the       US Army's White Paper on the Professional Military Ethic [C6].
The impacts of Rodin's work have considerable reach and significance.
Over the last decade, the work has contributed to a substantial shift of       the training in military ethics reaching thousands of military personnel,       in the US, UK and elsewhere, significantly shifting the understanding of       ethical choices, rights and responsibilities in combat and war.
Military practice has seen changes consistent with these research       insights.
While armed forces never comment on their rules of engagement,       press reports suggest that UK Rules of Engagement now permit the use of       lethal force against enemy combatants only if they are posing an imminent       threat to another person [C7].
This represents a course of action       that is neither required by international law, nor by the previous       consensus; it is consistent with the insight that liability for the use of       force must be based on individual responsibility for unjust harm and that       enemy combatant status of itself is not sufficient to justify the use of       lethal force.
In sum, Rodin's work has made a contribution to the way stakeholders in       the US and UK - ranging from strategic leaders to those participating in       combat operations - weigh their own responsibilities and rights and those       of others in killing and war.
