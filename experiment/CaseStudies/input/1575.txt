     Ha-Joon Chang's research has two major sets of beneficiaries outside the       academy &#8212; national and international policy-makers and the general public.
Impact on national and international policy-makers     Kicking Away the Ladder and associated research has had massive       impact on international policy-making to the present day, to the extent       that the term `kicking away the ladder' has become a standard expression       among WTO negotiators.
Since 2005 the Brazilian Foreign Ministry has made       the book mandatory reading for its diplomats (source [i]).
The impact of Chang's research is attested to by a range of sources: (i)       A developing country trade negotiator writes, "Dr Chang's work directly       informs and empowers policy makers in developing countries by helping them       realise and understand the range of credible policy options available for       pursuing their development goals.
With that knowledge and confidence they       can be better able to appreciate their situation and available options and       make more fully informed choices."
(source [ii]); (ii) A senior       advisor at Oxfam writes, "Ha-Joon Chang has been one of the most       influential heterodox critics of the orthodox thinking known as       `Washington Consensus'" (source [iii]); (iii) A senior official at       the UN writes that he can "testify both to the intellectual quality and       originality of Dr Chang's work, and to the considerable influence it has       had on a diverse range of policy issues critical to economic development.
I believe that Dr Chang is one of the most influential academic economists       in the area of international development policy-making" (source [iv]).
The President of Ecuador since 2007, Rafael Correa, has made frequent       references to Chang's work, for example in his speech given at the LSE in       2009 (source [v]).
Chang has been invited to speak on, and       occasionally produce reports on, trade and industrial policy issues.
For       example, since 2008, he has been invited to speak and advise by the       governments of Brazil, Ecuador, Finland, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Korea,       Malaysia, Mexico, Namibia, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Singapore, South       Africa, the UK, Uruguay, and Vietnam.
The most prominent examples are the       Annual Presidential Lecture of Indonesia (May 2011: audience of around 100       people, comprising the president, the cabinet, regional governors and       other top policy-makers), three exclusive lectures to the President and       all cabinet members of Namibia (October 2011), and his address to the       annual board meeting of Khazanah, the Malaysia sovereign wealth fund,       chaired by the country's Prime Minister (December 2011).
Impact on the general public     Key themes that had previously been explored in Kicking Away the         Ladder and associated research were popularised in the book, Bad         Samaritans (2007).
This was extended to include results from Chang's       broad study of institutions and markets, to produce a more extensive       critique of free market economics in 23 Things They Don't Tell You         About Capitalism (2010).
These two books have presented       research-based challenges to conventional wisdom in public understanding       of economic issues.
Since its publication in 2007, Bad Samaritans       has sold over 500,000 copies worldwide.
It has been translated into 12       languages, with two more in the pipeline.
23 Things They Don't Tell         You About Capitalism has sold over 600,000 copies worldwide since       its publication in 2010.
The book has been translated into 21 languages       and is awaiting 11 more (source [vi]).
These two books together       have generated economic value of around &#163;11.5 million in sales (1.15       million copies, estimated roughly at &#163;10 per copy).
In addition to the above, Chang has written about his research findings       extensively in the mass media, especially in the UK and in Korea.
In       particular, his columns in The Guardian, regular since the autumn       of 2011, have become some of the most popular ones in the Comments page of       the paper.
A March 2013 piece, `Britain: A Nation in Decay', had an       extraordinary 1,682 readers' comments (with 2,176 Facebook shares) and was       for 24 hours the most read column in the paper's website (source [vii]).
Another article, `Europe is haunted by the myth of the lazy mob' (January       2013), had 4,156 Facebook shares (445 readers' comments), suggesting a       stronger response from younger and/or international readers (source         [viii]).
These are exceptional numbers, especially for economics       articles.
Even the paper's most celebrated columnists writing on more       popular issues only occasionally get more than 1,000 readers' comments or       2,000 Facebook shares.
As a result of his research leading to his prominent engagement in       international policy debates and the high profile of his mass-market       books, Chang has had a very extensive media exposure worldwide &#8212; so far in       31 countries across all 5 occupied continents.
Prominent examples since       2008 include op-ed pieces in top international newspapers, such as The         Financial Times (UK) (25 October, 2010; co-authored with Ilene       Grabel) and The Wall Street Journal (US) (7 August, 2011);       appearances in TV, including `Newsnight' on BBC 2 (UK) (24 September, 2010       and 28 October, 2011), Icelandic TV (Iceland) (10 September, 2012), and TV       Slovenia (Slovenia) (23 January, 2013); appearances in the BBC Radio 4       programme `Thinking Allowed' (3 May, 2010); interviews in premier       newspapers, including De Volkskrant (the Netherlands) (12       December, 2008 and 27 November, 2011), Valor Economico (Brazil)       (9-11 January weekend, 2009), Clarin (Argentina) (26 July, 2009), La         Jornada (Mexico) (4 December, 2009), Kathimerini (Greece) (8       August, 2010 and 5 January, 2013), Gazeta Wyborcza (Poland) (31       December, 2011 - 1 January, 2012), El Mundo (Spain) (14 January,       2012), O Estado de Sao Paulo (Brazil) (7 May, 2012 and 7 January,       2013), Handelsblatt (Germany) (22 October, 2012), Spiegel       (Germany) (3 January, 2013), and Dziennik Gazeta Prawna       (Poland) (8-10 February weekend, 2013); interviews in prominent magazines,       including Vice Versa (The Netherlands) (February, 2009), Trends         Tendances (Belgium) (7 October, 2010), The Times Higher         Education Supplement (UK) (9 December, 2011), L'Espresso       (Italy) (21 May, 2012), Trend (Austria) (25 March, 2013), and Effect       (The Netherlands) (5 April, 2013) (source [ix]).
Chang's influence in public debate was recently recognised by the 2013       World Thinkers poll, organised by the Prospect magazine, in which       he ranked no.
18 overall.
The only economists who scored higher were Paul       Krugman (ranked 5) and Amartya Sen (ranked 7) (source [x]).
It is       thus reasonable to claim that Chang has helped to shape thinking about       both development and the nature of late-modern capitalism in countries       poor and rich, and at the level of popular as well as elite debates,       without falling into mere polemics.
The philosopher John Gray, indeed, has       said that Chang is `our best critic of capitalism', while `far from being       any kind of anti-capitalist' (source xi).
