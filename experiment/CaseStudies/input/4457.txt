     The research conducted by The Sensing &amp; Imaging Group has had impact       in categories including `prevention of harm', `economic' and `commercial',       with the chief beneficiaries being the Home Office, Metropolitan Police       Service and our industrial partners, Anglo Scientific.
Specifically, our       impact has been in:            The invention and development of new techniques for screening at a         distance that are both portable and which can be rapidly deployed.
The selection of suitable "bands" or wavelengths and operating         modalities of sensors operating in the electromagnetic spectrum where         concealed threats can be effectively detected at standoff distances.
The measurement and calibration of materials that can form threats or         simulate hazardous threat items.
The Sensing and Imaging Group are regularly consulted by Senior       Scientists from the Home Office Applied Science Division.
For example, in       2013 alone they have had several visits from the Home Office Chief       Scientist, have undertaken four weeks of joint trials and tests with the       same scientists, given at least 5 demonstrations in MMU labs to visiting       senior scientists and capability advisors, been invited to successfully       tender for closed bids.
In 2012, a live demonstration of the technology       was given to the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Bernard       Hogan-Howe and two of his deputies.
In addition to supplying vital data and know-how to the Home Office,       through its extensive research programme with the Metropolitan Police       Service and other government bodies, the group has developed a range of       deployable sensor technology for the screening of threats that are       effective at significant distances.
The Metropolitan Police Service have       corroborated the impact of this work with them in the following statement       received in June 2013 [A]:     "The group at MMU have developed the concept of using polarimetric         active radar to detect threats at a standoff distance, rather than         imaging, because these systems are more portable and effective at a         distance and therefore informed UK Government thinking on its approach         to the detection of concealed threats at standoff distances"     In an example of impact from this earlier work, the Home Office has       commissioned a research programme (in March 2013, the details of this work       are confidential) to characterise a range of materials that are of       interest to them.
The results of this research will further inform the       Home Office Centre for Applied Science and Technology of the way forward       for its comprehensive programme of testing and validating technology for       people and baggage screening technology.
The following statement by the       Home Office in July 2013 [B] corroborates this impact:     "The group at MMU have undertaken work with CAST that directly informs         Government thinking in gaining enhanced capability in the important area         of standoff threat detection.
The work undertaken by Prof Bowring's         group will provide higher performing, lower cost alternatives for law         enforcement agencies.
The programme of work into materials         characterisation also informs the important aviation security area,         which is vitally important to the UK economy. "
Currently the threat detection technology and associated IPR are in the       process of being licensed to a UK company and prototype devices exist and       have been demonstrated commercially.
Commercially produced devices are       expected to be taken up by police forces, security forces and other law       enforcement bodies.
The first production versions are now being built       (October 2013).
The impact of the technology is expected to increase and       provide improved security products which are relatively inexpensive when       compared to currently available products.
The Chairman of Anglo Scientific       Ltd who has licensed the technology from the university is able to       corroborate this impact.
Below is an extract from a statement he has       provided (October 2013);     "The Sensing and Imaging Group at Manchester Metropolitan University         has invented and developed novel techniques for the remote detection of         threat items and contraband that are portable, effective, unique, and         which are well covered by protective patents.
We are in the process of         investing into the group and also are producing these devices for         manufacture, with company having expended &#163;100,000 on productisation in         2013, with an expected &#163;500,000 committed for 2014" [C]     The group has had expressions of interest from the US Department of       Defence, having given a live demonstration in London in 2011, and has had       a recent (October 2013) enquiry from US Army Laboratories, where the       technology will be demonstrated early in 2014, and from the US Navy       (November 2013)     There has been considerable interest from the media (BBC 2006, 2009,       2013, ITV 2013).
Because of the sensitive nature of the technology, most       of these approaches have been refused, but these articles were produced by       the BBC: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24941084       and http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8089959.stm.
Also, professor Bowring was interviewed by Radio Manchester in 2006.
