     At Thompson's instigation, a team from the world-renowned Th&#233;&#226;tre du       Soleil, led by founder Ariane Mnouchkine, began a series of workshops at       Phare Ponleu Selpak Arts and Social Services Centre in northwestern       Cambodia.
Phare harnesses arts training to social ends, offering shelter, support       and training in arts activities to young people from this deprived region.
Though some taking part had circus training, few had completed high       school; five were illiterate.
The project transformed their education,       professional expertise and understanding of Cambodia's history, as their       comments reveal:            `Before beginning...we knew only what our parents...told us about the         Khmer Rouge: hunger, forced labour, disappearances, torture.'
(Le           Temps 25.10.2011 (a-3))       `Through our acting...we came to understand that the Khmer Rouge         nourished an ideal for the country, that they did not represent a         monolithic bloc, but that they spiralled...into murderous madness.'
(As         above)       `I want the whole world to understand, to know the history and the         culture of my country.'
(Revue XXI, `Le Cambodge sur un plateau,'         winter 2012 (a-3))          One critic described the project as establishing a `popular       university...under the care of Ashley Thompson, ever ready to mend       memories ripped apart' (M&#233;diapart 27.10.2011 (a-3)).
Four       performances of work-in-progress in Cambodia in 2010-11 drew approximately       1,000 viewers, primarily Cambodian.
The show incited debate among those       who had lived through the events, and helped the inter-generational       retelling of their stories (Infosud 28.3.12 (a-3)).
Audience       members included NGO workers and Ministry officials, who were acutely       conscious of the play's political significance; permission for a run in       the capital Phnom Penh was withdrawn.
On the strength of seeing the       production, the Director of Lyon's Festival Sens Interdit offered to fund       completion of the work and a French tour (a-4).
The three-hour production       of the First Epoch of the play opened at the festival in October 2011       starting a seven-venue tour of France, including a two-week run at the       Cartoucherie, Paris.
In France it was seen by 8,606 spectators (a-5).
A       two-month tour of the full six-hour play is scheduled for autumn 2013 (in       Lisbon, Limoges, Lyon, V&#233;nissieux, Valence, Toulouse, and at the       prestigious Festival d'Automne in Paris).
The Cambodian actors, musicians and technicians were paid by the day       during the workshops, and receive salaries for the tours.
One returned       home to show her mother `more money than we had ever seen'; she and       another actor from the production have been hired by Phare to lead       development of new theatrical work; others have been hired as theatre       teachers (a-4).
One critic wrote how the project `transforms destinies' of people `with       backgrounds of destitute poverty.'
The article relates how one actress       `subject to the violence of a furious husband finds her liberation in art'       and is now `taking audiences by storm' (M&#233;diapart 27.10.11 (a-3)).
The project brought a profound career transformation to Co-Director       Georges Bigot.
He tells how Leeds research informed aspects of the       production: `when we began to address the exigencies of the text...it was       above all Khmer specialist Ashley Thompson...who shored us up.'
(Les         Affiches du Grenoble et du Dauphin&#233; 21.10.2011 (a-3))     The project's impact on public debate in Cambodia was profound.
One       journalist likened the play's effect to a bomb exploding, adding: `The       troupe takes on political taboos in re-establishing, through a nuanced       interpretation of characters...the complexity of the situation.'
She cites       an actress: `We know we take a risk in performing it...we decided to not       let ourselves fall prey to fear.
Because all we are doing is       rehabilitating the history of our country.'
(Le Temps 25.10.2011       (a-3)).
Thompson and Prenowitz participated in numerous post-performance       discussions and roundtables held at events commemorating the Cambodian       genocide (a-6), including an exhibition opening at the French Cultural       Centre, Battambang, 2010 (approximately 200 attendees), where renowned       artist-survivor Vann Nath exchanged with high school students on the       production's taboo-breaking in contemporary Cambodia.
This key question of       initial project research (2), as well as that undertaken during the       production period (1), examining the play's breadth of historical       interpretation up against political limitations placed on contemporary       public discourse, proved a recurring discussion topic among Khmer diaspora       audience members and the troupe (a-4).
The production had a significant impact on French education, with       Thompson acting as consultant on the development of two pedagogical       instruments (a-7):            A 26-page Th&#233;&#226;tre du Soleil booklet for highschool teachers taking         classes to see the production.
A 34-page dossier developed by the French Ministry of Education for         the 2013 national curriculum for highschool students specialising in         Performing Arts, all of whom will visit the production.
In 2012 Phare won two major prizes: a Prince Claus Fund For Culture and       Development Award for `dedicated and inspirational application of       culture's capacity to confront and transform trauma' and an EDF Foundation       Trophy for the project's `service of culture and social integration,' the       &#8364;10,000 prize being invested in the 2013 tour (a-8).
Supported by a French Government grant, a vast publicly-accessible       project archive including rehearsal footage, media cuttings, texts...       launched online in 2013 (a).
The web archive will be transferred to the       Biblioth&#232;que nationale de France in 2015, where it will be further       developed.
