     The IDEAS at Daresbury project supported 60 new technology businesses in       the area over a       period of 16 months from March 2009.
The IDEAS programme exceeded most of       the original       targets submitted to its stakeholders (the ERDF and the NWDA) including       businesses supported       60, original target 40), jobs created (55, target 5) and jobs safeguarded       (10, target 15).
The IDEAS       programme promoted effective knowledge exchange at the interface between       SMEs, universities       and strategic government-funded science.
The programme was delivered       through a series of       short, highly interactive workshop programmes, master classes, academic       mentoring and student       projects, resulted in significant improvements in the businesses       supported.
These drew on four       research groups: the business and management schools of Lancaster,       Liverpool and Manchester       Universities and Imagination Lancaster, a design-led research lab at       Lancaster University.
This       collaboration allowed firms to benefit from the wider networks of the       partner institutions.
The IDEAS         syllabus:     The syllabus consisted of three programmes, delivered by the project       partners including Fogg and       Soetanto from IEED.
Participants could attend anywhere from one to all       three sessions:            `Customer-Focused Innovation' (May 2009) &#8212; developing a customer         focused and innovative         approach from conception to market for technology focused SMEs       `Competitive Advantage through People and Processes'         (November-December 2009) &#8212; optimising         internal resources to exceed customer expectations and respond to the         current         business environment       `Beyond Networking: Creativity, Collaboration and Growth'         (January-February 2010) &#8212; provided         practical tools to identify and maximise the power of participants'         networks.
Each programme consisted of four or five day workshops that highlighted       critical issues for small       businesses.The Connect Workshop (part of the Beyond Networking programme),       for example,       was designed to help entrepreneurs `tap into collaborative groups where       they can share business       ideas and discuss and review their plans' (Fogg, 2010, Beyond         Networking).
The Director of Attido       Mobile (formerly Ravensoft) summed up his experience, stating that the       workshops provide       `Academic advice on areas of business that we as engineers have limited         experience of'.
They delivered an integrated learning model, built on the concepts of       networking, discussed in       Section 2.
These research insights provided a basis for understanding       important elements of       networking and its potential contribution to innovation and business       growth.
In the sessions,       business owners were helped to understand how to develop and exploit their       networks more       effectively to create opportunities, innovate and explore new markets and       products.
The Director       of Collabor8 Online fed back that `I knew about networks but I didn't         recognise `nets' ... and this         notion of heterogeneous and remote and not remote and diverse, it was a         very useful exercise to         get a good understanding of exactly what a network is.'
Participant entrepreneurs were provided with tools for visualising and       reflecting on their networks       and were encouraged to look at the benefits of using specific contacts in       problem solving,       innovation and product development.
Through an interactive, hands-on       mapping exercise       delegates got a better picture of their network, including strength of       ties measured not just by       frequency of contact but also by the trust/closeness of relationships and       by their length.
The       Director of Microfold fed back that it was `useful to write things         down and draw the nets on paper:         normally I would have them in my head but you can't always connect         things immediately, so once         you have the pictures in front of you, it's more obvious.'
This work       was developed further into       bespoke reports for the participant companies, based on their assessment       of various types of       contacts.
These included contacts who were `core', `who could help with       new ideas', `could help to       test new ideas' and `could help bring ideas to market'.
The CEO of SimX conveyed that it helped him to expand his company, `SimX         was two people         when we started on the IDEAS programme, we've moved site and expanding         so it's been a rapid         change for us and the idea of being able to take a step back and being         able to think about that,         plan it, use some of the more academic techniques has really changed         me.'
He provided a videoclip       on the LUMS website of his experience on the programme.
On 12th March 2010 all the project partners held an ESRC       Festival of Social Sciences funded       Workshop titled `Entrepreneurial Networks: impact and business growth' to       disseminate initial       findings from the project.
Resulting impact of IDEAS programme:     `IDEAS is a wonderful example of knowledge exchange in action.
We want         to see a culture that         enables, celebrates and rewards talent and innovation.
IDEAS shows how         this can be done.'
CEO, Technology Strategy Board.
Following on from the success of this       initial programme with the       technology industry in the North West, the IEED has been awarded funding       to vastly expand on       the work and insights from IDEAS at a regional, national and international       level.
Regional:     An external evaluation by EKOS Ltd of Lancaster's ERDF projects,       including IDEAS, in March       2012 showed that for `every &#163;1 invested (in the projects), &#163;15.80 is         generated in the Northwest         economy.'
This return on investment and impact, led to a successful       application for a further       ERDF-funded project led by LUMS: the &#163;3.8m Innovation         for Growth (IFG) project, embedding       innovation into the processes and practices of SMEs across the North West       of England.
So far the       project has worked with 320 SMEs and safeguarded 300 jobs and created 180       new jobs.
National:     The theoretical and practical insights of IDEAS fed into a new &#163;5.1m       project, `The London         Creative and Digital Fusion', part-financed by the ERDF and led by       IEED, to support the       convergence and network development of London-based SMEs in the creative       and digital       industries.
So far the project has worked with 460 SMEs with a target of       526 SMEs by project end,       to safeguard 150 jobs and create another 150 new jobs.
International:     On the strength of the IDEAS project, LUMS was invited to become a       partner in a &#163;160k       INTERREG IVC EU-funded project,       `Making Knowledge Work', to share best practice in       knowledge exchange across Europe.
It sought to exploit ideas and foster       smart, sustainable       growth by exchanging experiences on how regions support the process of       commercialising ideas.
`The         Lancaster China Catalyst Programme' (a cross-faculty project) aims       to facilitate the growth of       UK technology focused SMEs to grow their commercial activities in China,       to create 240 new jobs       and boost the domestic economy by &#163;40m.
In May 2013 it was announced that       Lancaster would       be awarded &#163;5.1m primarily from the HEFCE         Catalyst Fund and the University, Lancashire       County Council and Guangdong Provincial Office for Science &amp;       Technology for the research and       innovation programme, due to start in January 2014.
It is anticipated that       400 high-growth UK       SMEs will participate in the programme, enabling them to develop their       leadership, innovative and       collaborative capacity to support long-term UK-China collaboration.
