     CCRI research into traditional food markets for NABMA led       directly to the following, according to their Chief Executive.
The       construction, by CCRI, of the national retail markets database of       traditional food markets was endorsed by the All Party Parliamentary       Markets Group (A).
The Department for Communities and Local Government       (DCLG) Select Committee Report, Market failure?
Can the traditional         market survive?
(2009) used the CCRI research to establish a markets       working group and to create a ministerial role within DCLG for traditional       markets.
DCLG's Good Practice Guide for Markets also included a number of       CCRI recommendations.
In addition, NABMA used the CCRI research in its       submission to the Mary Portas Review of the High Street (2011),       sponsored by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.
NABMAs Love         Your Local Market (2013) campaign was a direct outcome of the CCRI       research.
[A]     The research team in the SOLINSA project worked in partnership       with two community food groups.
It made an active contribution to the       development and structure of the second Brighton and Hove Food Strategy       (Digging Deeper, 2012) in the areas of food awareness, safe affordable       food and providing sustainable food and waste recycling.
The team also       worked with the Permaculture Association in actively improving its       marketing strategies and developing its strategies for linking with the       farming industry and for research.
The team also facilitated two       `strategic review' discussion groups for the Association.
According to the       Permaculture Association Chief Executive, the CCRI's work "helped to         develop an innovative `co-housing' project with Leeds City Council and         housing associations ....... that included community food growing within         the overall project brief" (B).
The social impacts of fishing research led directly to changes in       the Shellfish Regulations for England's inshore waters.
It was also used       directly by Defra as a principal input to their economic assessment of the       impact of such fishing to the tourism economy of coastal communities, and       their social assessment of the welfare of these communities (25/03/2011)       (E).
In addition, the findings were utilised by Defra in informing the       creation of Marine Conservation Zones.
In the Local Food Project, the CCRI evaluated the &#163;60 million       initiative by the Big Lottery (2009 on) that encouraged local food growing       and capacity building within the community.
The whole programme benefited       from the CCRI's evaluation through the dissemination of both principles       and good practice.
A project instigator has noted, "I have enormously         valued the robust, rigorous and objective discussions within the CCRI         team on working out the best approaches; something that doesn't happen         very often within organisations and project delivery" (C).
The       project is being managed by Royal Society of Wild Trusts (RSWT), who's       manager notes that "through         communications all [Local Food] projects have benefitted in some way"       and that the strategic impact of the research had been considerable,       allowing the management team to "pitch the outcomes and emerging trends         of Local Food with robust evidence to the Big Lottery Fund policy         colleagues, addressing the wider context of community impact and not         just environment and food growing" (D).
The work of the CCRI on the       Local Food project is on-going but the RSWT project manager has commented       that whilst several organisations contribute understanding to the project,       the work of the CCRI has been `critical'.
The sustainable food organisation, f3 has worked with the CCRI on       the SOLINSA, SUPURB and Local Food projects.
According to       their Associate Director the research has "demystified the         notions of evaluation and impact for local food practitioners"       allowing communities on the ground to gain a better understanding of their       own influence (C).
Importantly, the CCRI has facilitated crossover between       academics and practitioners, leading to practitioners publishing academic       works and academics becoming directly involved in the local food movement.
The CCRI places considerable emphasis on informing wider societal debates       around food production and consumption and its wider impacts.
An example       of this can be seen in the Local Food evaluation where the CCRI's report       was presented to a conference of 500 delegates in the local food sector       (October 2012) and informed the creation of 3 films, shown on Community       Channel (23 July 2013) (F).
The research team have also contributed to       national debates, such as Kirwan's contribution to BBC Radio 4's `Farming       Today' and `Today' programmes regarding Farmers' Markets (25 June 2012)       (G).
In addition, CCRIs involvement in events such as the Royal Society on       `Sustainable Intensification as the Future of Farming' (May 2013) (H)       reflects the significance of its contribution to this debate.
