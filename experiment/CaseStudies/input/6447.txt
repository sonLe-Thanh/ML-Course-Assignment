     The two drawing exhibitions The 43 Uses of Drawing and Rhythm/Presence       that Cureton and Staff curated had a total of 5270 visitors.
In       addition to the curation of exhibitions, a series of learning resource         packs designed by Cureton were made available to download on the TES       website [ http://www.tes.co.uk ].
Nine       resource packs were uploaded onto TES and included "Drawing &amp;         Mapping," "Drawing &amp; Architecture" and "Drawing for Design."
As of 4th July 2013 there were a total number of 4294       visits to the core websites.
As of 11th June 2013 there had       been 58,558 visitors to the TES resource pages and a total of 38,708       resource packs downloaded.
In relation to these downloadable resource       packs for teachers 13 workshops were delivered either concurrently       with or after each of the exhibitions.
The content of these workshops was       directly keyed into and reflected some of the over-arching themes of the       exhibitions.
These workshops were devised to promote a particular engagement       with and exploration of drawing as a means of making sense not only of the       world, but of the individual's place within it.
Rather than solely       emphasising the importance of technical skill, the workshop activities       instead placed an emphasis upon the learner's imagination, their ability         to visualise and their willingness to explore and work       across imagery, media and technique.
Teachers of participating schools and colleges were asked to fill       in workshop evaluation questionnaires, which provided the means of       measuring impact.
Specifically, the feedback from the first round       of workshops evidenced the teachers intended to incorporate ideas       and approaches to drawing within their own pedagogy.
For example, a       teacher who attended a workshop that accompanied the first drawing       exhibition stated: "[they] loved the focus on drawing and the value of         developing ideas through drawing [and] inspired my Y10 lesson the next         day actually!"
Another teacher from the same round of workshops       asked in her feedback whether "they could come to school and offer the         idea as a whole school drawing experience."
Resulting from these       workshop series, Staff and Cureton were invited to deliver a staff         development session for teachers based at the Weston Favell Primary       School, Northamptonshire.
The teacher observed that "[a]ll staff         thoroughly enjoyed the session and we generally felt we had begun to         relax about our own personal inhibitions regarding drawing."
In addition to running a series of four drawing workshops for primary       schools that accompanied The 43 Uses of Drawing, Cureton organised       and delivered a number of training sessions for teachers of       schools in the region who were seeking to develop new skills and       incorporate aspects of the exhibition into their own pedagogy.
Participant       feedback from the workshops again indicates how the ideas that emerged       during Staff and Cureton's research was now directly informing and         impacting upon the pedagogy of individual teachers and educators.
For example, one teacher in their feedback commented that although       resource issues in their workplace had initially raised difficulties in       implementing the workshop ideas, they had "[b]een able to use         alternative processes such as screen printing, sewing, wire etc.
to         explore drawing in different ways."
This teacher also noted that the       training had given them "the initial starting point to try and         introduce using software to explore drawing."
Another teacher who       attended the same training noted that they were "able to adapt [their]         own teaching projects to suit the elements of the instruction given by         Paul [Cureton] and the drawing resources available from the university."
The most recent round of drawing workshops in 2013 were delivered as part       of the Rhythm/Presence exhibition.
These were delivered to a       number of groups of KS1 and KS2 students and centred upon,       as with the previous drawing workshops, particular themes within the       exhibition.
Feedback was provided by the teachers of the respective       schools and was indicative of how the approaches to drawing introduced       within the workshops could be adopted and subsequently developed by the       teachers themselves within their own pedagogy.
For example, the teacher       from St James Infant School in Northampton, when asked whether she would       incorporate aspects of the workshop within her own teaching, provided the       following response: "Definitely.
We do a topic on Journeys.
This         workshop will now feature in next year's planning!
It will be a       great extension to what we have begun."
Equally, the teacher from Kingsley       primary School in Northampton when asked the same question remarked:       "Absolutely!
I will use this with my new Year 1 class.
I will       follow the same idea but I will also use this when creating our story maps       of fictions stories."
Moreover, impact is measurable due to the comments given around how the         workshops had changed their understanding of what drawing can be and       how it can be used within a classroom setting.
For example, one       teacher remarked that the drawing workshop had "definitely" changed their       understanding whilst another noted "it was wonderful to see the         children working together to produce a `whole', but still be able to         work independently.
This is not often done in school &#8212; usually a group         piece is prescribed and achieving only one outcome."
