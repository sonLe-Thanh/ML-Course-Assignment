     At a time when public confidence in politics and politicians is very low       in Britain, the widespread dissemination of the research has helped to       improve public understanding about parliament, both at an elite-level, and       then indirectly through TV, radio and press to an audience of millions.
Citations by high profile parliamentarians and acknowledgements from the       widest range of political journalists demonstrate that Cowley's research       has helped to inform political debate in the UK, providing evidence to       help combat mythology.
[source 1]     The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, has made repeated references to the       work, as helping to demolish the myth of the slavish backbencher.
As he       said:     I undertake considerable outreach work with the public, and especially       schools and colleges, to try to engage them with politics and Parliament.
I often make reference to the work of Professor Cowley when trying to       persuade audiences that today's MPs are not, as many think, obedient but       in fact have become increasingly rebellious and independent.
His research       is therefore invaluable in providing a reliable and up-to-date account of       the behaviour of MPs and helping to demolish so many myths about their       behaviour.
[2]     There is an acknowledged improvement in the quality of political       reporting, ensuring that it is informed by the latest and most up-to-date       political research.
As Robert Hutton, the parliamentary correspondent for       Bloomberg, has said, the research `has fundamentally changed how         political reporters view the behaviour of MPs.
As both journalists       and parliamentarians have adjusted to the new reality of coalition, their       work is consulted on a constant basis by every lobby correspondent I       know'.
Further positive feedback on the impact of the research has come       from sources such as: Gary Gibbon, the Political Editor of Channel 4, who       said that the research was `priceless', `essential' and had `informed and       improved' his reporting; Andrew Sparrow, of the Guardian said that       it `makes a significant contribution to the public understanding of         parliament'; Mark D'Arcy, who presents Yesterday in Parliament for       Radio 4, argued that the research provided an alternative, objective       source, `the kind of perspectives... that used to be the presence of a few       astute party whips'.
In May 2010, the Guardian dedicated its `In Praise of...' leader       to Cowley.
They said:     Rare is the scholar that penetrates beyond the academy and into public         consciousness.
The work of Nottingham's Philip Cowley has indisputably         made the leap... Cowley took the trouble to measure the historical       truth, and demolished the myth, and now every punter worth their salt       knows that there are more rebel hearts than ever among today's MPs.
[the       research] is so authoritative that even the whips use it....[3]     Indeed, some products of the research &#8212; such as the claim that the         current parliament is the most rebellious of the post-war era &#8212; have now         entered the political blood stream, and become so widespread that       they get cited back to Cowley by practitioners, who are often unaware of       where they originally came from.
[4] In July 2008 one finding (that Gordon       Brown suffered more rebellions in his first month than any other post-war       Prime Minister) was even used (uncredited) as a quiz question on Channel       5's The Wright Stuff!
The key to achieving such widespread understanding of the work has been a       many-layered approach to dissemination:            The establishment of a research-based website (www.revolts.co.uk), to disseminate         findings.
This was set up in 2004 &#8212; before blogging became fashionable         in academia &#8212; and has been regularly updated since.
It became           routinely used by journalists and politicians alike as their source of           data on backbench behaviour.
When the resource to fund the site         looked in jeopardy, it was cited as `one of the best examples of the         type of impact the academy should seek to emulate' (by Sunder Katwala,         then of the Fabian Society); Ben Brogan (of the Telegraph)         described it as a `groundbreaking project [which] has over the years         established itself as a vital reference point for politics'.
Its funding         was also raised in the Commons.
[5]       Supplementation of the website by other social media, of which         the most obvious is Twitter &#8212; where Cowley has over 6,200 followers,         including almost all senior political journalists &#8212; and postings on         other blogs and outlets, especially Nottingham's Ballots and Bullets         site, where he posts regular explanatory updates on developments in the         Commons.
[6] But however disseminated, the principle has been the same:         to highlight and explain current developments in parliament, drawing on         the research.
Production of regular briefing notes, applying the research to         ongoing developments in the Commons.
These have put rebellions into         their historical context; provided benchmarks and ready reckoners for         journalists to use; discussed and explored the motivations of rebels;         and explained the outcome of votes.
As well as being disseminated         online, these briefing papers were also sent to political journalists         and columnists with whom Cowley had contacts.
In addition, every           year since 2008 the project has published an end-of session (or           end-of-Parliament) report, detailing rebellions in the previous         year, which has been widely disseminated to stakeholders, as well as         available free-of-charge online.
The 2013 report was launched at the         British Academy in May 2013 and its findings were reported on outlets         including: the World At One (on Radio 4), Yesterday in Parliament (also         Radio 4), the Daily Politics (BBC2), Channel 4 News, the Guardian,           Telegraph, Express, Bloomberg, Huffington Post, and         BusinessWeek.
Previous reports have attracted similar coverage.
Frequent written contributions for outlets which reach beyond the           academic community.
Articles have been written both for the         national press (such as The Times and Guardian) and more         specialised publications (such as The House Magazine and Total           Politics) and websites (such as LibDem Voice and ConservativeHome).
Examples of authored articles by Cowley include: in The Times:         `Biggest rebellion to date is sign of trouble to come' (23 October         2011); `Rebels with few previous causes' (9 December 2010); in the Guardian:         `Who will be bravest in the tuition fees vote?'
(7 December 2010);         `Student fees: why the Lib Dems' broken promises are what counts' (16         November 2010); in The House Magazine: `Equal Marriage: The         Great Divide' (7 February 2013); `March of the Troublemakers' (10 May         2012); in Total Politics: `Trouble ahead?
The likely rebellions         to the Queen's Speech' (10 May 2012); `The ring of no confidence' (18         June 2009); for LibDem Voice: `And then there was one...         (Unmasked!
The only backbench Lib Dem MP 100% loyal to the Coalition)'         (18 November 2011); `The reality is a long way from equidistance' (14         January 2008); for ConservativeHome: `Key facts on the size and         nature of last night's Tory budget rebellion' (1 November 2012); `What         will the Conservative Parliamentary Party be like after the next general         election?'
(8 January 2009).
Exposure for the research on broadcast media.
The research         formed the subject of Cowley's authored lecture for Radio 4         (`Forethought'), first broadcast 25 May 2011, with an estimated audience         of 450,000.
Other broadcast media appearances discussing the research         have included every major broadcaster in the UK.
High profile talks at seminars and events organised outside           academia, including those organised by the House of Commons         library, the Lords Speaker, and the Government whips.
[7] These have         included events organised by lobbyists and thinktanks.
Chris Rumfitt, a         Managing Director of Edelman, the world's largest PR company, described         a presentation to their Public Affairs team as `of a sort that we           would just be unable to get from any other source... colleagues         found it interesting and extremely useful in helping them understand         developments at Westminster, and I know that it has helped inform our         work since then'.
Greg Power, the Director of Global Partners, for whom         several sessions on dissent have been run, said: `we only work with         academics... whose expertise is applicable... Cowley provides exactly         this sort of expertise.
'[8]          As a result of this proactive dissemination strategy, findings from         the research have been covered by all major media outlets in the UK and         beyond, including multiple features in every major British       newspaper, on BBC (radio and television), Channel 4, Sky News, ITV, along       with a host of overseas outlets.
Listing the occasions when the research       has been cited in the media or Parliament would itself take up more than       the length of this case study.
As illustrative examples only, see       the following, all of which are reports based entirely on the research:       `Backbenchers more rebellious than at any stage since World War Two' (Independent,       9 May 2012); `Gordon Brown faced more revolts last year than any PM since       Edward Heath' (Guardian, 4 December 2008); `Gordon Brown suffers       backbench rebellions as he struggles to control party', Telegraph,       17 November 2009); `Gordon Brown struggles to maintain discipline after       103 rebellions', Times, 26 December 2008; `Rebel MPs who vote       against the Government' (BBC Daily Politics, 24 January 2011);       `Labour's rebellious streak' BBC Website, 25 February 2011).
For       its use in Parliament, see examples such as in the Commons (HC Debs, 24       June 2009) or Lords (HL Debs, 26 January 2011, c1047).
In total,         between 1 January 2008 and 1 June 2013, Cowley's research was featured         in 169 newspaper stories, spanning eight countries.
