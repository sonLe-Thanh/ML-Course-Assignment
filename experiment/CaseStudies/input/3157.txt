     Danchev's work has had a wide-ranging effect on the cultural landscape in       two key domains: For       museums and galleries his work has informed the content of their       programming and in some cases       led to innovatory changes in practice.
For contemporary practitioners and       writers it has stimulated       debate and inspired new approaches in their work.
The audiences who engage       with the work of       museums and galleries (through exhibitions and public programmes) and       practitioners and writers       (through their work and publications) have subsequently benefited from       this enriched content.
Significant media engagement with this work forms a third strand of the       narrative below, and adds       to the contribution the research makes to expanding the terms of cultural       debate around art, artists       and politics.
Influencing curatorial approaches and practice for large national         galleries       A sustained relationship between Danchev and the Imperial War Museum       (IWM), based on       Danchev's work on Art and War and Terror (3.3, 3.4), has produced       `valuable outcomes' for the       Museum through a change in its curatorial approach and practice.
A       workshop organised by the       British International Studies Association and Political Studies       Association (BISA/PSA) Art &amp; Politics       Group (co-founded by Danchev, Debbie Lisle and Bernadette Buckley in 2004)       ,`On Art and       Terror', at St Antony's College, Oxford (9 November 2009), drew on ideas       from his 2009 On Art         and War and Terror (3.3).
It included a public lecture by Danchev on       Gerhard Richter and the       Baader-Meinhof Group.
The lecture was attended by the IWM's Head Curator       of Photography, who       leads on the Museum's interpretation of all matters pertaining to war       photography (including       research programmes, public exhibitions, publications, events or       collections development       programmes).
The relationship initiated at this workshop between the       curator and Danchev has       underpinned new developments at the IWM.
It has:            contributed to a sequence of IWM exhibition projects in which the         curator explores the artistic         impact of supposedly documentary photographs of conflict in dialogue         with the IWM's Head         Curator of Art.
This sequence includes displaying the work of artists         which is `entirely         innovatory in the context of IWM';       informed the curator's approach in planning a conference featuring Don         McCullin, Michael         Nicholson, Sir John Tusa, Philip Knightly and attended by the general         public (with students         and scholars);       informed the IWM's approach to and interpretation of the depiction of         atrocity;       informed and supported the curator's work in initiating IWM         Contemporary- a new, permanent         IWM programme examining the diverse response of artists and         photographers to         contemporary conflict;       inspired the setting up of IWM's war and media network (5.1).
In addition to these substantive changes in approach and practice       implemented by the IWM,       Danchev has been engaged by the National Gallery (NG) and the National       Portrait Gallery (NPG)       to offer his research perspectives on recent exhibitions, ultimately       contributing to the way in which       these institutions have interpreted visual culture for their audiences,       and in so doing influenced the       way in which they have enriched the lives and stimulated the imaginations       of their audiences: In       2006, he was engaged by the NG as it prepared the exhibition C&#233;zanne         in Britain, providing,       according to the Curator of Post-1800 Paintings, `excellent advice as we       shaped the exhibition'       (5.2).
Building on from the success of that engagement, the NG turned to       Danchev for advice in       2008-9 as they were preparing an exhibition on Picasso, impressed by his       `original and provocative       assessment of Picasso's skill at positioning himself in artistic and       political currents in fraught times'       [3.1].
Danchev's take on Picasso was `enormously helpful to us in       formulating our approach' (5.2).
The NG regards the relationship as ongoing, hoping to further `draw on his       expertise, global       perspective, and highly original interpretive skills to hone our       presentation of Modern art to our vast       public'.
It is clear from the curator's statement that he also draws       directly on the published outputs       of Danchev, which he values as offering new interpretations and approaches       (5.2).
Danchev has       also contributed `memorable' public programme content for the Head of       Adult Learning at NG on       C&#233;zanne, garnering `excellent attendance' (193) and positive feedback from       the audience and       organisers such that it was identified by NG's senior management as `one       of the highlights of our       programme this year' (2013) (5.3).
Danchev's research contributed to the decision taken by the National       Portrait Gallery (NPG) to       undertake a major exhibition of work by C&#233;zanne (forthcoming).
As the       Director of the NPG       explains, following the publication of his `outstanding' Life of Paul         C&#233;zanne [3.6], `Alex Danchev       started a discussion about the possibility of a C&#233;zanne Portraits       exhibition, which coincided with       some thinking of our own, and has now led to the research and planning of       just such a major       international exhibition project' in collaboration with the National       Gallery of Art in Washington DC       and the Mus&#233;e d'Orsay in Paris (5.4).
Finally, the Commissaire of the       Braque exhibition at the       Grand Palais (Sept 2013-Jan 2014), Paris) acknowledges the value of       Danchev's `subtle analysis'       of the artist and `nuanced conclusions' in his Braque biography [3.2].
The       Commissaire says, `I       recommended this book to all the authors in the catalogue, who are as       delighted as I am...' (5.5).
An extract from Danchev's biography was used in the exhibition catalogue       (5.5).
These examples show a demonstrable link between Danchev's research and       the endeavours of       major national galleries to develop, engage and stimulate the intellects       and sensibilities of their       audiences through provocative, research-informed exhibition content.
Influencing thought and practice for contemporary practitioners &amp;         writers       Danchev's research on art and politics (specifically On Art and War         and Terror [3.3] and 100         Artists' Manifestos [3.5]) has inspired contemporary artists in       their thought and practice and has       stimulated new artistic expression and new critical responses:     &#8226; Award-winning photographer Ed Clark acknowledges the influence       of Danchev's work on his       practice.
Clark (winner of the Royal Photographic Society Hood Medal for       Outstanding       Photography for Public Service, Best Book Awards at the International       Photography Awards       (The Lucies) and the New York Photo Awards and the British Journal of       Photography       International Photography Award) says of On Art and War and Terror       (3.3): `It is an important       book.
It influenced me in a variety of ways' and has `contributed to       helping me define themes in       my on-going work exploring the use of control and incarceration in the War       on Terror' (5.6);     &#8226; Freee Art Collective has written a chapter for a new book       entitled Manifesto Now!
Instructions         for Performance, Philosophy, Politics which it feels contributes to       the debate that Danchev       begins in the 100 manifestos book [3.5]: Freee collective feels that the       collection of manifestos       in Danchev's book `revitalises the notion of the manifesto for       contemporary art [and] generates       new discussions amongst artists about the power of the manifesto and       enables a more informed       debate about its potential in contemporary art.
Alex Danchev's work       `brings manifestos to a new       generation of contemporary artists and legitimises the manifesto as an art       form; this contributes       to the current debates around the spectator, the participant and the       co-producer who are all       important publics in relation to engaging with culture'.
(5.6);     &#8226; The co-founder of the Stuckists art movement (237 groups in 52       countries) considers 100         Artists' Manifestos [3.5] to have made a significant intervention in       contemporary debates about       art, artists and the political.
He comments that the publication of the       book, and its inclusion of       previously marginalised or `blanked' material (or material which might       have brought it into       opposition with an `art establishment') is in and of itself `a polemical       action that impacts on the       contemporary art scene'.
He continues that the book `removes power from       the exclusive hold of       commercial interests and contributes towards the reinstatement of       intellectual honesty' (5.6)     Contributing new knowledge and insight to public debate through media         engagement       Danchev's publications straddle the scholarly and popular and have been       read extensively by       extra-academic audiences, and reviewed and discussed by broadcast and       broadsheet journalists.
The critical response to his work (5.8, 5.9) confirms that his key ideas       can be said to have changed       the terms of cultural debate around the figure of the artist, the nature       of artists' biographies, and       the value of their writings:     &#8226; 100 Artists' Manifestos (3.5) is in its fifth reprint since       2011, a 6th is planned, and it has already       sold over 13,000 copies (5.7).
It has reached audiences nationally and (in       translation)       internationally.
It has enlarged the terms of cultural debate, not only       through the inclusion of       manifestos by women and by movements that had previously been `blanked',       but also through its       scholarly consideration of a form of writing that had previously been       side-lined, and its positioning       of the manifestos as cultural and social documents in their own right.
Its       widespread critical       acclaim has served to reinvigorate public debate more broadly about the       relationship between art,       artists and politics, evidenced by the way in which it has featured in a       range of high profile       broadcast and print media (5.8): On `Start the Week' (31 January 2011),       distinguished artist       Susan Hiller testified to the significance of 100 Artists' Manifestos,       and in particular its role in       presenting for the first time some manifestos that were previously       unpublished and unknown:       `One of the values of your book is that you've brought these out for       public contemplation.
For       example you've included some manifestos by women artists which were       totally unknown to me ...
It's much more than a collection of artists' manifestos; it's almost like       taking the temperature of art       as time passes.
'; Terry Eagleton engaged with the book through an       extensive review article in the       Times Literary Supplement (25 March 2011) where he commented that       the manifestos had been       `deftly selected and stylishly introduced' (5.8);     &#8226; Critical responses to Danchev's biographical work, in       particular that on C&#233;zanne (3.6) (over       15,000 sold since 2012 [5.7], and identified as one of the most `reviewed       books of the year' in       2012), indicate the degree to which his approach has been transformative       in the field of artists'       biography: Frances Spalding writing in the Independent, for which       Danchev's Cezanne: A Life       was book of the week (27 October 2012) suggests that `the reach of this       book is unlikely ever to       be surpassed in the search for C&#233;zanne' (5.9).
Hilary Spurling from the Telegraph       says `this is a       biography for an age that takes C&#233;zanne's supreme clarity, balance and       pictorial logic for       granted.
Far from putting him back in the context he came from, it       explores his relations with the       world he shaped.'
(19 November 2012) (5.9).
Julian Bell writing for the Guardian       calls the       biography `original, engaging and highly persuasive' (19 October 2012) and       declared it to be one       of the books of the year 2012 (5.9).
