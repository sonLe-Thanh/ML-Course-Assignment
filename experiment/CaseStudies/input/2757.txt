     Europe's ageing population is often cited as placing a `burden' on       society and the public purse.
It is in some of our most remote and rural       areas that populations are ageing most quickly &#8212; in the same areas service       delivery is particularly challenging.
Highland, for example, has seen a       32% rise in residents over 80 and 22% rise in those aged between 65 and 79       over the last decade.
Policy has suggested the need for innovative service       delivery solutions.
O4O sought to find ways of tackling this by involving       rural older people in creating their own solutions to the challenges of       ageing and rural life.
We aimed to test policy rhetoric about the role of individuals and       communities in accepting responsibility for their own care and the       changing role of public services from top-down delivery to co-production.
We helped answer questions such as: if communities are to do more, how do       they go about it?
Do all communities have the capacity to do this?
What       are the implications for individuals and communities of taking on the       responsibility of developing and running services?
[1], [5].
The positive       impacts from the O4O project research have manifested in several ways:     Services created: O4O worked with 21 rural communities, ranging       from populations of around 300 to more than 3,000, across the Northern       Periphery between 2007 and 2010.
In 15 communities, an older person's       service was successfully established [A].
Several social enterprises were       developed with the support of the O4O researchers and continue to deliver       services to, and with, older people in rural areas.
In Scotland, this       comprises Community Care Assynt (CCA) which was established in       2010 as a community interest company to run services for older people in       the Lochinver community [B] and Transport for Tongue, Melness and         Skerray (T4T) created in 2009 which runs a dial-a-ride and lift       sharing scheme [C].
These services created 6 part-time jobs within the       lifetime of the O4O project [A].
In Sweden, a village meeting place and       handyman service also created employment &#8212; there establishment was driven       by three "well known" older people within the village, one of whom become       the project manager [A].
Other services include: intergenerational IT       courses (Sweden); lunch club and restaurant (Northern Ireland); a meeting       centre (Finland); fitness groups (Greenland); radio programmes (Northern       Ireland); home visiting service (Greenland) and an oral history/dvd       project (Scotland) [A].
Health and quality of life improved: the ageing population brings       a considerable load of chronic illness and complex morbities, combined       with wellbeing problems linked to loneliness and exclusion due to lack of       access.
O4O addressed these public health issues by providing an       intervention to keep older people healthy at home in 15 rural communities       and a model that can be applied in other rural communities [A], [H].
Participants in the project reported positive health and wellbeing       benefits from taking part, including: improved balance; extended social       networks; mental stimulation; improved mood; raised spirit and increased       sense of worth; increased sense of belonging and sense of place; revival       in interest and preservation of traditional knowledge and skills [A].
The       O4O services created by the project have the delivery of health and       wellbeing benefits to rural older people as key aims.
CCA, for example,       has developed the Assynt Centre as a community care hub, offering a range       of opportunities for social interaction, peer support and the development       of social networks in the Lochinver area [A], [B].
A video produced by the       EC on the O4O project, highlights the benefits as experienced by residents       of the Highland village of Tongue where older people developed their own       transport system to make a difference to the lives of other older people       in the community.
As the video shows, service users such as Georgina, said       they no longer felt `beholden' to friends and neighbours for transport.
This was perceived to benefit individual's wellbeing, not least by       combating isolation [C].
Perceptions changed: O4O has helped change perceptions by showing       the capacity of older people to take part in service delivery [A].
O4O       built entrepreneurial and economic capacity in a group (rural older       people) generally perceived to be less innovative and dynamic &#8212; thereby       contributing to a changing ethos in society towards older people as a       positive economic force in their own right with their own needs for goods       and services and increasingly their own skills to build enterprises       (social and commercial) to meet those needs [E].
Our work has been       highlighted in this context by, for example, Euro-Health-Net [I], SCVO [I]       and SCPHRP [H].
At project end in 2010 there had been 5,706 visitors to       the project website with 13,250 copies of our materials distributed or       downloaded [A].
Policy challenged, tested and influenced: O4O research has helped       to disseminate knowledge on how older people can be supported to take a       greater role in the development and delivery of services.
CRH researchers       were invited to contribute knowledge from O4O to regional and national       development of policy (Highland Council, NHS Highland, Joint Improvement       Team 2009 - 2011) on the future care of older people and the involvement       of older people in meeting their own future service needs [A].
This has       led to, for example, the creation of community development workers for       older people posts within the Highland Council region in 2010 [H] and the       innovative approach suggested by O4O highlighted in a Scottish Government       publication [F].
Public sector bodies have also disseminated O4O materials       in order to train (Northern Ireland) or encourage (Highland; Moray)       communities to develop O4O social enterprises [A].
In one area (Argyll and       Bute) further work was commissioned in 2012 to involve older people in       developing home care service solutions.
The work of O4O has been taken up       by policy makers and voluntary groups in many European countries &#8212; as       winner of a 2012 RegioStars award (Inclusive Growth: Strategies,       Initiatives or Projects Addressing the Challenge of Demographic Change and       Supporting Active Aging) the O4O concept has been widely disseminated       throughout Europe as an example of best practice for rural areas [C], [D],       [E], [I] and over 100 invited presentations delivered on O4O [A].
