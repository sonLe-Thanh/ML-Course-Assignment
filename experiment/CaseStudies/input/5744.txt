     Impact on Policy: After three years of industry-wide debate       (2005-2008), Ofgem concluded, "We believe LRIC, which is based on         incremental cost, is the better foundation for pricing method with the         objective of promoting more efficient network development to meet         customer needs" [a].
Ofgem consequently in 2008 required all       DNOs in the UK to adopt LRIC and, in reaching this decision, sought views       from all stakeholders.
For example, Northern Powergrid (formerly CE       Electric) strongly supported the move, stating that LRIC, "is the best         methodology to adopt as it most closely aligns to, and provides a         programmatic balance of, the principles that have been developed",       and, further, that it "provides the purest economic signals", [a].
In summary, policy debate has been stimulated and policy         decisions have been informed by research evidence.
Impact on Industrial Practice &amp; Standards: Bath's local DNO,       Western Power Distribution, implemented the LRIC methodology for their       extra high voltage (EHV) distribution system in April 2007.
Following       Ofgem's 2008 decision for its adoption as a licence obligation, LRIC was       subsequently developed into a common methodology by the industry and in       April 2011 it was adopted by the three remaining DNOs for their EHV       systems in England and Wales.
All four DNOs have confirmed this adoption,       a typical statement being "UK Power Networks have implemented the         version of the EHV Distribution Charging Methodology (EDCM) which         utilises the LRIC pricing approach as originally developed for Ofgem by         Bath University.
The EDCM is used for the calculation of charges in all         three of our licenced areas including the East England, South East         England and London."

In summary, through LRIC, industry's professional         standards, have been informed, improved processes have been adopted and,         professionals have used research findings in the conduct of their work.
In addition, Bath has provided technical support to industry's adoption of       LRIC through consultancies [c], thus the efficiency of providing a         professional service has been improved.
Over time, the adoption of       LRIC will reduce the investment required to accommodate the anticipated       dramatic expansion of low-carbon technologies [d] and thus lower the cost       of low-carbon transition.
Bath's research thus allows DNOs to take the       lead in combatting climate change and helps the UK meet its CO2       emissions targets.
The Development of Policies and Services of Benefit to the Developing         World: The development and implementation of Bath's LRIC methodology       for distribution networks has stimulated debate and resulted in benefits         for countries in the developing world &#8212; and in particular Brazil,       India and China.
The Brazilian distribution charging structure reform was       influenced by Bath's research through Prof Li's participation in the       International Seminar on Electricity Tariff Structure organised by the       Brazilian energy regulator, ANEEL, in 2009 [e], through in-depth       discussion with their tariff design team [f] and through collaboration       with their lead scientist for network charges [g].
This subsequently led       to the establishment of the IEEE Power and Energy Society International       Working Group (IWG) on Network Charging chaired by Li (Bath) [h].
Through       this IWG, LRIC has received significant interest from Brazil, Germany,       Demark and India, which has, in turn, had a major impact on the research       work's focus and direction at Bath and stimulated further research.
The impact on India has been through a UK/Indian Scientific Seminar held       in Jaipur, February 2013.
Bath led the UK delegation and used the       opportunity to explore with leading Indian power industries and academics       new tariff structures that are both economically efficient and socially       acceptable [i].
This event was co-sponsored by the Departments of Business       Innovation and Skills (UK) and Science and Technology (India).
It has led       to a &#163;2 million UK/Indian consortium project led by Bath and IIT Roorkee       in Smart Grid with Energy Storage (EPSRC/DST-HEAPD).
In April 2013, Bath       was invited by the China National Development and Reform Commission       (Beijing) to disseminate the UK's network charging structure and presented       a report documenting its evolution as part of China's international review       to support its electricity market reform.
Many of Bath's PhDs and PDRAs have gone on to take roles in network       planning and pricing in the UK and internationally, including Scottish       &amp; Southern Energy, UK (H Heng and B Kuri) and The State Grid       Corporation, China (J Wang, B Li, Y Zhang).
Through this pathway, highly         skilled people have taken up specialist roles that draw on their         research.
In summary, this research has had a major impact on government policy,       which has fed through industrial practice and standards to result in       societal, economic and environmental benefits.
