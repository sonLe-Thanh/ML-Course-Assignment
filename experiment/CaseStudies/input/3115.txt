     Research on Paul Sandby's life and work underpinned the exhibition Picturing         Britain: Paul         Sandby (1731-1809), shown in Nottingham, Edinburgh and London,       through picture display and       design, captions and storyboards, and a fully illustrated catalogue which       disseminated new       findings about the artist to a wide audience.
The exhibition was designed       to reveal the full range       of the artist's creative output.
Many of the 155 works by Sandby, and his       brother Thomas, from       the NCMAG collection were combined with material loaned by public and       private repositories,       including the Yale Centre for British Art and the Royal Collection.
More       than 105,000 people       visited Picturing Britain (32,403 in Nottingham, 30,521 in       Edinburgh and 42,312 in London).
In       excess of 5,000 copies of the catalogue were purchased during the period       of the exhibition.
The       catalogue, identified by several reviewers as the definitive publication       on Sandby's life and       works, remains on sale today (a, b, c).
According to two prominent       reviewers, the exhibition       challenged common understandings of `topographical' art (a) and "rescue[d]           Sandby from a         reputation as a mere, easily comprehended jobbing artist"       (c).
The Director of Academic       Services at the Royal Academy has confirmed that the exhibition brought       new knowledge and       understanding of the artist and his social context (j).
By showing in three major venues across the UK, Picturing Britain       extended knowledge of an       important but little-known artist to a national audience, significantly       enhancing public understanding       of the larger topic of 18th century topographic and landscape       art.
The inclusion of materials from all       aspects and periods of Sandby's career was especially significant in the       latter respect.
By       highlighting the relationship between Sandby the map-maker and Sandby the       landscape artist,       Picturing Britain deepened public understanding of an important       though rarely considered theme in       the history of geography.
As the Director of Academic Services at the       Royal Academy noted: "the         spectacle of the Great Map of the Highlands greeted the visitor at           the opening of the         exhibition, intending to shake any pre-conceptions that they might           have about Paul Sandby,         the watercolourist" (j).
The impact of Picturing Britain is most readily analysed in       Nottingham whose cultural reputation as       home to an internationally important art collection was substantially       enhanced by the exhibition.
The 32,403 people who visited the exhibition in Nottingham, almost a third       of the total across all       three venues, is the equivalent to one in ten of the city's entire       population.
Visitor comments in       Nottingham were extremely positive (g).
NCMAG, the principal beneficiary       of the research, also       benefitted most directly from catalogue sales.
Picturing Britain       was the centrepiece of NCMAG's       2009 programme and was widely reviewed in the national press before its       relocation to Edinburgh       and London (c, d, e).
This is unusual as journalists generally review       touring exhibitions shown       initially in provincial cities only after their arrival in London.
According to one reviewer: "this         exhibition is very much a Nottingham achievement" (c).
This       is confirmed by NCMAG's       Exhibitions Manager who has stated that "[t]he impact of the           exhibition was proportionately         greater in Nottingham that at the national venues to which it toured"       (h).
This was partly       because the exhibition was accompanied at Nottingham by a programme of       sold-out lectures,       guided gallery tours and a conference.
Most importantly, NCMAG significantly modified its policy and practice as       a direct result of the       exhibition's success.
In the words of the manager of Nottingham's museums,       the research       undertaken by Daniels and Bonehill "showed the art of the possible"       by considering "other         collections outside of our area and our collection, further afield           and over many years,         adding layers of knowledge and creating a legacy for the collections"       (i).
As NCMAG's       Exhibitions Manager also notes, the fact that Picturing Britain       was a success at prestigious,       internationally important venues in Edinburgh and London "changed           perceptions at a senior         level within the organisation.
Previously, there had been an           assumption that such shows         had to be imported from outside Nottingham.
Now it is recognised that           Nottingham's own         collection can be a catalyst for, and form the basis of, major           exhibitions of national         significance" (h).
The success of the exhibition in London,       affirmed by RA's Director of       Academic Studies, was especially important as the RA rarely collaborates       with regional       museums and galleries (j).
Following the success of Picturing Britain, NCMAG reviewed its       policy and practice in relation to       public exhibitions and collection management and commissioned an       independent review of its       Fine Art collection with a view to applying for Arts Council designation.
The review resulted in a       series of 'Spotlight' displays to highlight key strengths of the       collection that began in March       2013.
The Nottingham City Museums and Galleries Forward Plan (2012-15)       also identified the       need for touring exhibitions based on the NCMAG permanent collection every       three years from       2015 (f).
In the words of the NCMAG Exhibitions Manager: "every           three years we should be         trying to do a Sandby" (i).
The exhibition was also       highlighted in NCMAG's successful       application to the Arts Council's strategic development fund on England's       Renaissance.
Picturing Britain also reinforced the strong reciprocal       relationship between Nottingham City Council       and the University of Nottingham.
As the NCMAG Exhibitions Manager       explains: "Academic         validation of the collections... becomes ever more important at a           time when Local         Authorities are squeezed.
Academic collaboration brings attention to           NCMAG and can help         the Local Authority to recognise the importance of the collections we           hold" (h).
