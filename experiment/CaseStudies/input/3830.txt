     The influence of the body of research extends into the military and       military and defence academies       of a number of countries throughout the world.
These texts and other       collections in Ashgate's       Military and Defence Ethics series, edited by the MEEN research       team, have become standard       points of reference for discussion of military ethics education in       military and defence academies       around the world.
The research of the project has also dovetailed with the       work of the International       Society for Military Ethics, originally US-based and now with a European       branch inaugurated in       conjunction with MEEN.
This ensures dissemination wherever military ethics       education is       practised.
The impact of this research is attested to by a Senior Lecturer       from the Defence Studies       Department of the Joint Services Command and Staff College, in the UK       Defence College,       Shrivenham: `Books in the Ethics Education series are in the Staff College       library and are used       extensively by students researching aspects of ethics and law education       and training in the       military.
These aren't "normal" students, but those studying on the       Advanced Command and Staff       Course preparing for senior leadership positions and therefore with       influence on the way the       profession develops in the future...I have seen MEEN-related publications       cited in Canada, Serbia,       Brazil and even Colombia by professionals involved in military training       and education'.
This picture       is endorsed by a Senior Lecturer from the Royal Military Academy       Sandhurst, when he writes (see       section 5 below): `I have taken some of the ethical insights highlighted       by my membership of       MEEN to countries such as the Congo, Sudan, Brunei, Saudi Arabia and many       others'; moreover,       `The MEEN edited volumes are widely consulted here by British Army officer       students at the       RMAS'.
Prior to the work of MEEN, ethics education in the military was typically       seen as peripheral and       generally entrusted (depending on location and service) to       non-specialists, chaplains or their       equivalents and regarded as essentially a matter of private morality.
This       has changed, partly as a       result of changing forms, means, purposes and theatres of warfare,       together with a different       understanding of the roles and responsibilities of both officers and other       military personnel.
MEEN       has been at the forefront of thinking through the implications of these       changes.
Hence the welcome       given to the project both in supporting its research and also in the       activity of disseminating and       drawing on it, its personnel and its publications.
The impact is       acknowledge thus, by the Stockdale       Professor of Professional Military Ethics of the US Naval War College (see       section 5): `it is safe to       say that no other group has as much knowledge of the ways ethics education       in the military is       approached and delivered globally as does the MEEN group...I'm not aware       of any other individual       or group who have made a systematic comparative study on an international       level'.
This impact is       corroborated by a Senior Lecturer (UK Defence College, Shrivenham; see       section 5): `MEEN did       the very necessary job of asking the right questions at just the right       time thus prompting much       thought within different militaries and by those academics interested in       studying them'.
A key part of the MEEN research has been the identification and spreading       of good practice       through the military academies of the world as well as having direct       contact with military personnel       on active service.
This has been done continuously through personal       contact, consultation, visits,       conferences, email and other exchanges and publications.
Impact can be       grouped under four       categories: ethics in training and education; ethics as an integral part       of military reasoning; pre-deployment       briefings; post-deployment briefings and interviews.
Indicatively: the importance of the International Network for the Study       of Ethics Education in the       Military and the UoA's significance in its creation and operations is       attested to by the Stockdale       Center for Ethics and Leadership of the US Naval Academy (see section 5)       who writes: `in addition       to improving pedagogical practice, the network became known as a community       of scholarly inquiry       devoted to exploring some of the most significant contemporary issues       within the field of military       ethics itself', evidence `suggest[s] that [its relevant outputs'] impact       has been likewise international       and widespread'.
Moreover, `the collaboration fostered by this project       resulted in establishing in       Europe and the UK a new chapter of the International Society of Military       Ethics...This simply would       not have occurred without the support and active engagement of the       original participants in MEEN'.
Ethics in training and education.
The curricula of a number of         military academies include         reference to the MEEN programme and its outputs.
In particular, the         value and use of case studies         has been developed and refined; dependence on the notion that ethics is         imbibed as part of         character training and development without the need for explicit         consideration of ethical reasoning         has been successfully challenged; consideration of the integration of         ethics into the curriculum and         training for officers has affected the provision of training.
An Ethics           Education in the Military model         education programme is being developed and will be used as a template         for setting up courses of         study in the emerging democracies and elsewhere.
This includes         dissemination of best practice,         e.g.
consideration of the use of the Krigskollen (Norway Military         academy) model in constructing a         military ethics teaching programme at the Romanian Military academy         (ongoing).
Practice and         curriculum design in the established military academies who are active         members of (or closely         associated with) the network continue to be modified and developed in         consequence of discussion         and consultation with the members of the project (see section 5 below).
Ethics as an integral component of military reasoning.
Active         consultations and engagements         with the military have influenced directly the way in which serving         officers think about ethical issues         integral to military practice.
This occurred through engagement with         those directly employed to         teaching military ethics or to train character development, and high         ranking officers in the armed         forces pushing the military ethics education agenda.
Examples include         Commodore Keble, Royal         Navy, engagements with the French Army and Air Force, the US army, air         force, and navy, the         Canadian army.
(See letters from Stockdale Center for Ethics and         Leadership cited in section 5).
Pre-deployment briefings.
The preparation and training that         officers received prior to military         engagement in the past typically did not include explicit reference to         ethics and ethical reasoning         as such.
The MEEN project has helped introduce an explicit ethics         component in pre-deployment         training, and has, by invitation, taken part in pre-deployment         briefings.
(See letter from the         Commodore of the Royal Navy cited in section 5.)
Post-deployment de-briefings and interviews.
These took place         both in the initial phases of the         research, feeding in to understanding of the nature of the problems and         challenges of ethics         education in the military, and also in its later phases, at which point         feedback on MEEN research         was directly forthcoming from active military participants.
The sessions         were also, in themselves,         regarded as valuable by many participants in enhancing their own ethical         awareness.
(See letter         from the Senior Lecturer, Royal Military Academy, section 5).
Dissemination events     The MEEN project has disseminated lessons from its research directly to       members of the group       through conferences, workshops and other forums, and to the military more       generally through       briefings, interviews and discussions, and publication in Ashgate's Military         and Defence Ethics       series.
Major dissemination events/locations include: UK Defence Academy,       Shrivenham; French       Air Force Academy, Salon-en-Provence; pre-deployment briefing, Royal       Marines, Stonehouse       Barracks, Exeter; International Society for Military Ethics (ISME Europe).
We have established a       military ethics email and web based discussion thread attracting       contributions from officers and       educators from around the world and run an active Twitter feed.
