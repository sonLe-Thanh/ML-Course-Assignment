     Working in partnership with national and international film archives,       museums and stakeholders in `visual arts' and `urban heritage', CAVA's       research activities have made key contributions to the enhancement of the       understanding and shaping of public attitudes towards archival film       culture.
Evidence of this can be found in published material where the       work is cited (e.g., Bate 2010: 95; Velez-Serna 2011: 544-46); TV/Radio,       press and media coverage (e.g., BBC, ITV, GMTV); and impact reports (e.g.
Impact 08; AHRC reviews) linked to Liverpool's nomination as European       Capital of Culture 2008.
Our three consecutive AHRC projects, on film and       cities, contributed to the national `Screen Heritage UK' programme.
Liverpool received special mention as `a very successful programme' in the       British Film Institute's report to the House of Lords Select Committee on       Communications, in its inquiry into the British film and television       industries, 2009.
The BFI relied on this work when preparing its       subsequent `Portrait of Britain' national project.
The reach and significance of our research into cinematic geography,       archaeology and place is in three specific areas:     1.
Enhancements to heritage preservation, conservation and presentation:     a) Film Databases, 2008, 2014: The creation of two city film       databases (City in Film and Cinematic Geographies of Battersea) has transformed the way researchers,       practitioners and the public can interrogate film archives.
Web statistics       show that several thousand visitors used the resource.
b) BFI Screenonline 2008-9: Collaboration with the BFI on the  Liverpool Screenonline project, the UK's first film archive of a city       (45,000 users by March 2013), was developed and made available to schools,       universities and public libraries.
Organisation of nine       screening/discussion events with local filmmakers, artists, community       activists, which were attended by between 30 and 800 participants.
c) Mitchell and Kenyon, St George's Hall, 2008: With Prof.       Toulmin (Sheffield University) and the BFI, as part of Liverpool's 2008       European Capital of Culture programme, re-enacted the screening of       material from one of the UK's most important film archives &#8212; Mitchell and Kenyon's Liverpool Films (1901/2).
The first venue in       Liverpool had an audience of over 1,000.
The screening had impact in terms       of engaging the public with the history of the city using archive film and       on people's memory of the city (Liverpool Echo, 30.04.08; Daily         Post, 06.05.08), TV (ITV) and radio (BBC Merseyside).

Production of cultural artefacts to enhance cultural understanding         of place and people:     a) Members of the research group were consultants to Hurricane Films for       Terrence Davis' film Of Time and the City, 2008, and used archive footage sourced       through their research.
The contribution is acknowledged in the film       credits.
The digital database by Koeck and Roberts, including the       retrieval and study of films at the North West Film Archive, enabled       filmmakers to create the first Liverpool feature-length film composed       entirely from archive footage.
The film was screened and received special       mention at Cannes         Film Festival 2008; nominations for a BAFTA       and British Independent Film Award (Best British Documentary, 2008) and a       New York Film Critics Circle Award (2009), and positive newspaper reviews       e.g.
in The Guardian.
b) Two installations at the National Museums of Liverpool (NML), 2011-12:       Lumi&#232;re           and the Overhead Railway and Mapping the City in Film       provided opportunities for two permanent exhibitions, utilising animation,       historical maps and interactive displays at the         Museum.
The work provided previously unknown spatial context of the       earliest Liverpool films.
It was the most visited museum outside London in       2011-12.
Lectures were attended by more than 1000 people and were reported       on the History         Network in the USA.

Stimulation of public debate:     a) Urban Planning Strategies: Koeck served as consultant to Nanning       (2010), Macau (2011) and Nanjing (2012) to develop with them film/visual       culture-based strategies for city branding and urban regeneration.
The       Nanning Urban and Rural Planning Bureau subsequently revised its       development into a regeneration, which included the preservation of a       historical inner-city district.
This change in policy, with greater       emphasis on "cultural industry" and "cultural heritage", was publically         announced by the government.
b) English Heritage was a partner on Cinematic           Geographies of Battersea (2012-13).
This project led to new       understanding regarding the role of moving images/film for the UK's       cultural heritage as well as the use of digital and social media to       `stitch' cultural history back into urban space.
It is the first time that       The Survey of London (founded 1894) has referenced this role of film in       the context of an investigation of urban/architectural heritage.
