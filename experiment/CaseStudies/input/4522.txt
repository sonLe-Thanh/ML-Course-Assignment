     Policy and legislation impact &#8212; firearms violence and control:       SQUIRES' gun crime research on the illegal mixed economy of firearms in       the UK is cited by the Academy of Social Sciences in its Making the         Case for the Social Sciences 2011 series of publications, in Booklet       no.
4, `Crime' (source 5.1), as an example of pioneering research in       criminology that has had a successful impact on policy.
The research had a       highly significant series of impacts in the wake of the Cumbria 2010       shootings, when the Home Affairs Select Committee undertook an inquiry       into firearms control.
The resulting Firearms control &#8212; Third         Report of Session 2010-2011, Volume 1 by the Home Affairs Committee (HC         447-I, 2010) accepted and went on to present to Government specific       recommendations made in evidence by SQUIRES on the misuse of firearms       (5.2).
These included evidence in relation to:            legal weapon possession and domestic violence (para.
21)       the impact of the 1998 handgun ban (para.
29)       the role of `readily convertible' weapons and firearms supply (para.
123)       anti-social behaviour and the misuse of air weapons (para.
129).
In particular, the Committee noted that: `On the basis of data         submitted to the Cullen Inquiry, and that collected more recently by         Professor Squires and the Gun Control Network, we are concerned about         the use of legal firearms in domestic incidents, often linked to         domestic violence'.
The Committee also accepted the suggestion by       SQUIRES that policing agencies `...make generalised data about the         illegal gun market available to academics and policymakers more widely         ... in recognition of the contribution that such individuals can make to         crime reduction' (5.2).
A number of these recommendations were       specifically accepted by Government (The Government Response to the 3rd         Report from the Home Affairs Committee session 2010-11, HC 447 -         Firearms Control (HC 8155, September 2011) (5.3).
Consequently, in       new legislation, Part 8 of the current Anti-social Behaviour, Crime         and Policing Bill (sections 100 and 101) (5.4) now includes       recommendations relating to a proposed new offence of `illegal firearm         possession with intent to supply', which traces back to the evidence       presented by SQUIRES to the Home Affairs Committee (5.2: section 4, from       para.
105).
Subsequently, the Home Office incorporated proposals relating       to records of domestic violence risk and spousal counter-signatories into       the revised Guide on Firearms Licensing Law 2013 (5.5) distributed       to all police forces to guide their determination of firearm licence       applications and renewals based on earlier evidence on firearms in the       home and domestic violence risks presented to the Home Affairs Committee       (5.2).
Policy impact &#8212; CCTV surveillance: During 2009 to 2010, SQUIRES       joined a working party of the European Forum for Urban Safety (EFUS)       commissioned to develop a protocol of evidence-led guidance and good       practice in CCTV policy development.
The EU Charter for the Democratic         Use of Video-Surveillance, based on the protocol, was launched in       Rotterdam, becoming formally adopted in Lisbon in November 2010, being       incorporated and implemented by the EFUS network of EU cities and regions.
Evidence presented by SQUIRES to EFUS provided clarification and offered       useful lessons for improving the process of policy transfer in this area       to inform the effective integration of CCTV into the criminal justice and       security infrastructures.
This evidence demonstrated the importance of       effective evaluation in crime prevention development, pointing out the       need for appropriate accountability safeguards and realistic expectations       of CCTV development.
It thereby directly underpinned the EU Citizens'       Charter on CCTV surveillance.
SQUIRES' article on evaluating CCTV       effectiveness was published by EFUS in a companion volume to the new EU       Charter Citizens, Cities and Video-Surveillance (EFUS, 2010) (5.6,       5.7).
Policy discourse and public debate: SQUIRES' interventions as a       public academic integrating academic and policy research have had a       subsequent impact on policy and public discourse and debate in the field       of youth and public safety.
SQUIRES was part of a team in 2008 developing       an evidence base on gangs and weapon use for the Street Weapons Commission       chaired by Cherie Blair for Channel 4 (5.8).
The commission recommended       elements of a `violence reduction strategy', which became a central       feature of government policy.
SQUIRES worked in 2009 for the Children's       Commissioner for England in a meta-analysis (5.9) examining the use of       weapons by children and young people, drawing attention to the fact that       this phenomenon was closely associated with disadvantage, social       exclusion, victimisation and disrupted childhoods and was not, therefore,       amenable to enforcement-led strategies alone (5.9), as reflected in the       cross-governmental Violence Reduction Strategy of 2011.
Following       appointment in 2013 to the UK Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO)       National Independent Advisory Group on Criminal Use of Firearms, SQUIRES       continues to contribute to policy and practice debates in these areas.
As a leading European commentator on firearms controls, SQUIRES       participates frequently in public debate, including an international       symposium on firearms and self-defence in Washington, DC and a live TV       debate (5.10) in March 2012 with Wayne La Pierre, Executive Vice-President       for the US National Rifle Association concerning the UN Arms Trade Treaty,       to which the NRA was vehemently opposed but which the US Obama       Administration backed.
Following the shooting tragedy at Sandy Hook       School, Connecticut (14 December, 2012) SQUIRES participated in over 40       national and international TV news, radio, press and online interviews and       commentaries.
His work has also been cited as an `invaluable resource' in       the Vice-Presidential Special Commission Report Reducing Gun Violence         in America (Webster and Vernick, eds.
2013) (5.11).
