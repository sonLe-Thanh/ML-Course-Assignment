     Nature of the Impact: the LSE research described in Section 2 led       to three main types of impact:     A.
The assessment framework developed by LSE researchers is shaping         the way of thinking of those responsible for setting healthcare         priorities in the UK and beyond:            the Health Foundation, a leading healthcare think-tank in the UK, has         invested &#163;200,000 (in addition to the grant to LSE listed above) to         produce toolkit and guidance material for implementing the assessment         framework LSE has developed.
The LSE team has been contributing as a key         member of a steering group to the development of the tool.
The tool is         called "socio-technical allocation of resources" or "STAR" and can be         downloaded for free (http://www.health.org.uk/areas-of-work/star/)         Free training modules are also available several times a year;       the Global Fund, which is the world's largest financial supporter of         programmes to fight AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, invited the LSE team         to run pilots to test its approach in helping recipient countries in         developing clear investment plans that are good value-for-money.
The         first pilot was successful (Reference 15, in particular conclusions on p         35-36) and more are being scheduled for 2013/14;       the action research programme LSE conducted to design and test our         approach has influenced the way of thinking of those the School involved         (managers, clinical staff, patients, public representatives), as         discussed by Collier (6), as well as of healthcare planners in Tuscany         (Italy) as discussed by Nuti and Vainieri (7);       the work done in the Isle of Wight won an award for Excellence in         Commissioning from the Institute for Innovation and Improvement (8),         drawing the attention, and influencing the thinking, of healthcare         planners in the English NHS;       IMPRESS, a joint initiative between the two leading respiratory         clinical societies in the UK; http://impressresp.com/)         used the LSE approach in the development of a commissioning guide on         chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (9).
This work was highly praised         in an Editorial in the British Medical Journal by the Chief Knowledge         Office of the NHS (10): "The tool used by IMPRESS ... should be adopted         and adapted by all clinical communities of practice to estimate and         visualise the marginal benefits of all aspects of care for the benefit         of patients").
B.
Positive site-specific impacts on the local health economy:            NHS Sheffield changed the pathway of care for eating disorder services         by expanding the scale of early interventions (which were estimated to         be highly cost-effective) and hence reducing the need for later         intensive care (which was estimated not to be cost-effective) (6 and         11).
According to recent interviews with executives, this program of         action has improved the experience of patients, reduced costs by 15% and         improved service coordination (p 18-19 in 11).
Furthermore, resources         thus saved could be used to produce additional health for other         patients.
The Isle of Wight decided a strategy to fund seven from a short-list         of 21 initiatives from &#163;1m of `growth money' in 2008 (12).
One of the         results of LSE's collaboration with the Isle of Wight was the reduction         of emergency asthma admissions by 50% (page 17-18 in 12; description of         award in 8).
C. Shaping the way healthcare planners think about setting priorities:            Gwyn Bevan has been invited to be a witness to give evidence to two         Health Committees of the House of Commons (13).
Morton and Airoldi (14) were commissioned by the Department of Health         to contribute to a seminar series to show how the approach we have         developed could be used in developing policies for reducing health         inequalities.
They were also invited to present the LSE STAR tool to the         Marmot Review on the social determinants of health inequalities in         England.
Wider Implications:     Total health-care spending in England is over &#163;100 billion annually.
LSE       research is contributing significantly at the margin to improvements in       the ways that health-care funding is spent, and in some localities already       to improvements in health-care outcomes per unit of resource spent.
