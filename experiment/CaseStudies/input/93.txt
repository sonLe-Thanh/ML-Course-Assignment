     The impact of the research is not merely educational but integral to the       building of a stable society in Northern Ireland.
As a result of this work       the international aspect of the research has grown in recent years.
This       has created a virtuous circle, where experience gained internationally has       been used to influence and impact on government policy in Northern Ireland       in 2013.
Citizenship and Conflict                 By bringing forward research and evidence to show that reform of parts         of the NIC could be an integral part of building a stable and shared         society, including research commissioned by DENI on interschool links         and evaluations of Education for Mutual Understanding, the UNESCO Centre         has been central to curriculum reform in Northern Ireland.
As a         consequence this has had a direct impact on the 329,000 children and         young people currently enrolled in schools in Northern Ireland and         almost 20,000 teachers: (See section 5, source 3).
Working in partnership with the CCEA and those tasked with formulating         education policy ensured that the framework developed by the UNESCO         Centre researchers (Smith, McCully, O'Connor, Gallagher), both in         approach (inquiry based) and in terms of core concepts; Diversity and         Inclusion, Equality and Social Justice, Democracy and Active         Participation, and Human Rights and Social Responsibility, was included         and developed in the revised curriculum.
Dr Carmel Gallagher, former         head of curriculum development at the CCEA states that, `the             statutory requirements informed by the UNESCO Centre became a             central element of the Revised Northern Ireland Curriculum             Framework, which remains in place today.

Research carried out for the 2011 UNESCO Global Monitoring Report         exploring education and conflict has been recognised as `achieving             a global policy impact.
This is reflected in the very positive             reform of governments and aid agencies around the world to the GMR'         (See Section 5, source 5).
The concept of conflict sensitive education first referenced in         Smith's 2005 Compare article is referenced and accepted as UNICEFs         understanding of the term in an October 2011 proposal to the Dutch         Government in relation to education and peace-building, `Conflict             Sensitive Education &#8212; systemic analysis and delivery of education             systems from a conflict perspective as a routine part of educational             planning and practice.

Research for UNICEF (Novelli and Smith, 2011) has led to a major         global initiative (&#8364;120 m programme in 14 countries) to highlight the         importance of education as a central part of working in conflict         affected societies.
Corien Sips of the Dutch Government, commenting on         the impact of the research, stated that, `The interesting study             of Mario Novelli and Alan Smith about Education and Peace-building             was used as a building block for the new programme' (See         section 5, source 4).
Children in conflict affected countries where aid donors have         prioritised conflict sensitive education directly benefit from UNESCO         Centre research (See section 5, source 7)                 Rights                 Rights informed research carried out on behalf of the Integrated         Education Fund in Northern Ireland (Hansson et al., 2013) has provoked a         major debate on the future direction of education policy in and has been         recognised as critical in, `informing policy makers and             influencers in Washington, London, Brussels and Dublin.
Crucially,             this research made an important contribution to a major Northern             Ireland government report, Advancing Shared Education, published in             2013' (See section 5, source 9 and section 5 source 8).
Research on embedding a rights' based approach to children and young         people's well-being in Northern Ireland and Ireland, with particular         regard to UNESCO Centre experience in the field of education has led to         OFMdFM asking the Centre to build a child's rights indicators framework         for policy making across all government departments.
The framework has         been acknowledged as a critical policy lever by the First Minister of         Northern Ireland, Peter Robinson MLA: `The exercise             provides us with an opportunity to take a critical look at the state             of children's lives, using the Child Rights Indicator Framework             which we are developing with the UNESCO Centre.
The Framework will             provide an evidence base not just for the report but also for             assessing progress on the Executive's 10 year Strategy for Children             and Young People and for informing policy development in relation to             children and young people over the longer term' (Northern           Ireland Assembly, 19 April 2013) (See section 5, source 10).
Thus, the UNESCO Centre's research on education, conflict and children's       rights exemplifies the strategic approach of UOA25 generally with regard       to impact.
The unit recognises that the specific challenges of NI provide       an important context for development and research on these issues.
Over       time, a sound research base has enabled the unit to directly influence       policy and practice in NI as indicated above.
In turn, this has created       the confidence and expertise to apply this learning successfully to other       conflict affected societies in Europe, Asia and Africa.
