     The North         West Regional Development Agency identified in 2009 that regional       prosperity (GDP per head) is considerably below the UK (86% of the average       in 2008) and the USA (64% of the average in 2008).
The principal reason       for the gap is weak productivity performance where the North West level is       10% below the UK average and 25% below the USA average.
Productivity is       the key driver of the North West's long-term economic performance but the       shifting of the regional economy towards services has been recognised as a       drag on its productivity performance and widened the productivity and       prosperity gap2.
The productivity of the North West's       manufacturing businesses is vital to the prosperity of the region.
Supporting a priority component of the regional strategy to reduce the       economic growth rate disparity between the North West and other regions of       the UK and elsewhere, the ULMS team has undertaken an ambitious programme       of work to apply the LAM in order to improve the productivity and       resilience of the region's manufacturing SMEs.
Since 2008, the widespread       application of some or all of the seven steps of the LAM to the       manufacturing operations and supply chain systems of over 75 SMEs       throughout the North West region (approximately 10% of the region's       manufacturing SMEs) and the recognition of the effectiveness of the       applied research process has, regionally, supported the key growth       strategy and provided significant input for policymakers.
At the firm       level, it has enhanced the performance and sustainability of the region's       key, manufacturing SMEs, and, at the workforce level, it has improved the       leadership, management and innovation competencies of owner-managers, and       created 31 new jobs and safeguarded 117 at risk jobs.
Regional impact: the cumulative effect of transforming the         agile behaviours of the stock of firms supported has made an important         contribution to economic growth.
The SMEs were selected because of their         high-growth potential and their presence in key, economy-driving sectors         such as aerospace, automotive and precision engineering.
Their         contribution to the economy is far higher than their number alone would         suggest.
(It has been previously demonstrated by NESTA           2009 report, how relatively few businesses with high-growth         potential can make a disproportionately positive contribution to the UK         economy) The continued success of these SMEs is critical to the future         success of the North West region.
All continue to survive and prosper,         with a combined annual revenue generation in excess of &#163;1.25billion,         many with improved gross value added (GVA) performance (see SME dataset         referred to in section 5) and with sufficient economic weight to         catalyse the catch-up of the prosperity and productivity of the region.
The legacy benefit of improving the absorptive capacity for innovation         and the entrepreneurial culture of these firms has provided the region         with a platform of high added- value manufacturing SMEs which, in many         cases, via the application of the LAM, have been future-proofed against         market uncertainty and equipped with the means to respond to unexpected         requests and events, new opportunities and changes to customer demand         requirements.
Two separate clusters of SME members of the North West         Automotive Alliance are being actively supported through the development         of strategic initiatives in the areas of collaborative design and         collaborative procurement.
Business impact: At the firm level, the growth and         sustainability of the SMEs is related to LAM informed strategic change         developed by the firms' owners and managers as evidenced by the changes         to strategic positioning and direction that have been made at a number         of the SMEs.
For example, at Richardson's Healthcare, a series of         projects concerning the development of an agile operations strategy, and         changes to working practices and quality systems, led the MD to comment         "I didn't think that a bunch of academics can make such a difference.
The reality is that after two years we have doubled sales and           quadrupled profits."
At Anaco Systems and Beverston Engineering         new organisational strategies were conceived and implemented in order         for each firm to be able to more nimbly respond to, and routinely deal         with, customer orders for higher-volume, lower-variety products and         services.
A start-up plan for Weld Process, a new business, was created.
IT strategy development and its implementation resulted in radical and         positive changes to working practices at companies including Abbey         Engineering, Fergusson Joinery, Halo Laboratories, Hawke Engineering and         Huyton Heat Treatments.
Examples include new e-commerce strategies         developed for Seasoned Pioneers and IDM Engineering which allowed the         companies to have a much greater control of their on- line presence and         provided vital new sales channels.
Conspicuous changes to working         practices were designed and implemented at AMF Engineering where the         lead time of a key assembly process was reduced by 40%, at Haywood &amp;         Jackson where a new job costing procedure provided the stimulus for a         more profit-focused approach to business transactions causing the owner         to remark that "[UoL] have made a significant contribution to the           running of the business and our interaction with customers and           suppliers".
At Lift, Turn &amp; Move where a new approach to lean         thinking reduced production times by over 15% and at Hi-Tech Steel where         a new operations strategy allowed the company to compete effectively on         price while maintaining product and service quality.
New quality         management systems and procedures were implemented at MHA Integrated         Electronics, MHA Lighting and Oxton Engineering, and innovative new         production and measurement technologies were implemented at Croft         Engineering Services and Moorgate Engineering.
Workforce impact: The impact of the LAM also reaches into the         wider workforce with effects that extend within and beyond the SMEs.
First, entrepreneurial competencies and aspirations of owner-managers         have been shaped and re-invigorated from a wide range of mentoring,         assisting and coaching activities most notably at Abbey Engineering, AM         Robotic Systems, Anaco Systems, BTR, Future Safety and Millennium         Supplies.
The work has also led to continuous funding from regional         bodies in addition to funding from knowledge transfer partnerships         (KTP), and European and national research programmes.
Two LAM KTP         programmes have led to "business leader of tomorrow" awards for ULMS'         associates most recently at Hi-Tech Steel in 2009.
Second, direct         employment effects in the form of jobs saved and secured are evident;         for example, across our range of over 75 SMEs 31 new jobs have been         created and 117 jobs have been safeguarded as a direct consequence of         LAM projects (see the SME dataset referred to in section 5), with all         the implications that this has for those employees and their dependents.
By way of examples, some of the most notable employment effects have         occurred at Anaco Systems where 2 new jobs were created and 5         safeguarded and Haywood &amp; Jackson where 5 jobs were created and 9         were safeguarded.
