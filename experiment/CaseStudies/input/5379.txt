     The formation of Bio Nano Consulting arose from the realisation that       combining the expertise at Imperial College (A Cass in nanobiotechnology       and diagnostics, Tim Jones in nanomaterials) with that at UCL (G Aeppli in       nanofabrication and M Horton in nanomedicine), and drawing on the National       Physical Laboratory's metrology resources, would present a unique offering       in Bionanotechnology to provide services to the UK's biomedical sector.
Imperial College and UCL had already jointly established the London Centre       for Nanotechnology (LCN) in 2003 and discussions had started on how to       build on the academic excellence of the LCN to enhance its interactions       with industry.
A call for proposals in Micro and Nanotechnology       Manufacturing Facilities by the Department of Trade and Industry in 2004       led to a successful bid by the consortium of the 3 organisations (late       2005) [grant G1].
The company was incorporated in October 2007, appointing       the experienced Dr David Sarphie as CEO, who had "over a decade's worth         of senior management expertise in drug delivery, diagnostics and         medical-device companies" [A].
Following a total investment in       infrastructure, instrumentation and working capital of &#163;5m from the       Technology Strategy Board (TSB) and London Development Agency (LDA), it       was officially launched in April 2008 [A, B] as a "specialist product         development consultancy applying nanotechnology tools to address         real-world problems from the biomedical industry" [B].
In 2010, following steady growth in the business, Lord Alec Broers       accepted the role of Chairman.
By late 2010, BNC announced the completion       of its publically funded phase of corporate development.
To "mark the         company's transition to a self-supporting and revenue-funded         organisation, BNC...acquired new expanded offices in central London to         meet the increasing demand for its services and specialist expertise"       [C].
At that time BNC had "completed 22 projects for 16 life science         and high-technology sector companies" and, as an indication of its       continued success, "already [had] a further 10 projects actively in         progress" [C].
As a not-for-profit company, wholly owned by Imperial College London and       University College London, the business has focussed on applying expertise       in bio- and nanotechnology in the two universities to provide technical       consulting services to UK and overseas companies and institutions.
It       offers four main services: consultancy services, project management       services, contract research and development, and open access to       instrumentation [D].
The BNC business model is to be a `labless' company,       employing scientist and engineers, as well as project managers, who will       deliver the project objectives and who carry out the research in       collaborating academic institutions (Imperial and UCL).
In doing so, it       pays bench fees and equipment access charges to the Universities.
Over the       assessment period, the company has diversified both its client base and       the type of projects that it has taken on.
It currently employs 8 people       (7 PhD scientists/engineers with backgrounds in chemistry, materials       science and the life sciences) and has employed a yearly average of 13       people over the 2009-2012 period [Item 3, E, F, G].
It has generated &#163;6M       worth of revenues from both UK and overseas clients since 2008.
During the       2009- 2012 period, total revenues exceeded &#163;4.6M of which 78% was       attributable to overseas clients [Item 2, E, F, G].
BNC's business model of working closely with academic groups has resulted       in &#163;2.8M of the revenues being returned to the Universities through bench       fees and equipment access payments, as described above [Item 5/`Research       and development expenditure', E, F, G].
The company has filed 8 patent       applications and is actively negotiating exploitation agreements for       several of these.
In total, the company has had approximately 14 domestic       and international clients including: Oxford Immunotec Ltd., Applied Nano       Detectors Ltd, Lockheed-Martin Inc., Vestergaard Frandsen, Targanta       Therapeutics Inc., Linde A.G., King Abdulaziz University, [text removed       for publication] [H].
The nature of the consultancy has been quite varied       as is demonstrated in the examples below.
Oxford Immunotech Ltd: In the work with Oxford Immunitech Ltd, an       international medical diagnostics company, that commenced in 2008, BNC       applied "its expertise in nano- characterisation to assist Oxford         Immunotec in a project related to its novel Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSPOT         (ELISPOT) system...Oxford Immunotec [were] commercialising a diagnostic         test to detect tuberculosis (TB) based on its patented T-SPOT         technology, effectively providing a new way to diagnose and monitor this         deadly disease" [I].
By collaborating with Oxford Immunotec, BNC       facilitated the development of precise, accurate techniques to diagnose       and monitor infection and disease.
It developed and successfully       transferred a method that allowed the client to implement an improved QC       process for one of its bought-in assay components.
King Abdulaziz University (KAU), Saudi Arabia: In 2009 BNC was       chosen to "lead the UK arm of a collaboration with [KAU] in a         multi-million pound environmental nanotechnology endeavour.
The         agreement, worth in excess of &#163;2 million over two years for BNC and its         London partners,... [utilised] the expertise of the London Centre for         Nanotechnology (LCN...on two important projects looking at the         applications of nanotechnology to environmental issues: `nano-catalysts         for wastewater treatment' and `nano-catalysts for the synthesis of fine         chemicals'" [J].
In 2012, a further contract was signed with KAU "for         two collaborative research projects in the field of environmental         nanotechnology... worth &#163;1 million over two years for BNC and its London         partners...The aim of each project will be to develop new classes of         multifunctional nanomaterials that can pave the way for more sustainable         and energy-efficient processes" [K].
The work with KAU has resulted       in 6 patents being filed and 10 publications (as of June 2013).
The       patents and publications were a direct result of BNC enabling an on-going,       collaboration with Prof Milo Shaffer's group at Imperial.
Targanta Therapeutics Inc (Now part of the Medicines Company):       Targanta Therapeutics Inc. approached BNC in 2008 for help in elucidating       the mechanism of action of one its antibiotics (oritavancin), where the       lack of a defined mechanism was seen as a barrier to obtaining FDA       approval [L, M].
This project built on the BNC's experience with other       antibiotics.
BNC researchers "spearheaded the development of the         label-free detection of antibiotic-mucopeptide interactions using         cantilever arrays, achieving 100 pM sensitivity...This technique is now         being made available on a commercial basis for the assessment of         drug-target interaction for a broad range of other antibiotics and drugs         under development" [N].
This "novel technique exploiting         nanotechnology used in the micro-electronics industry presents the         opportunity to speed up the discovery process for antibiotics and other         pharmaceutical products, as well as many other diagnostic and         therapeutic processes" [L].
Commenting on the project Dr David       Sarphie, CEO of the BNC said, "We are thrilled to be working with a         company of the quality of Targanta Therapeutics and to assist them in         advancing their understanding of the mechanism of action of this new         antibiotic drug candidate.
This further establishes the BNC as a leader         in applying cantilever-array technology to the assessment of drug-target         interaction.
In addition, it further demonstrates the important role         that the BNC plays in the rapidly expanding bio-nanotechnology sector"       [M].
Linde A.G.: Working with Linde A.G., the company developed a       method for separating carbon nanotubes that was very successful.
The head       of nanotechnology at Linde testifies: "Bio Nano Consulting facilitated         a program of collaborative work to advance a UCL/Imperial technology for         the separation of carbon nanotubes from academic research to the point         of commercialization.
The team at BNC managed the overall project,         organised regular meetings and ensured that all milestones and report         deadlines were met in accordance with the agreed schedule...the         responsiveness was vastly superior compared to similar projects at other         institutions...Overall the project was a great success and resulted in         not only the commercialisation of the technology, but the establishment         of a new business entity in our company" [O].
Linde subsequently       spun out a company to develop this work further.
