     The significance and reach of the impact of this research is evidenced by       the changes in policy recommended by several UK government departments,       citations of the methodology in government white papers and frequent       mention of the research in parliamentary discussions.
The Accounts       Coordinator for Programmes and Projects at the British Council       corroborates that what `the report did was to set a benchmark as this work       had not been previously done.
So education can be treated as a part of the       UK economy just as manufacturing.'
Publication of the project results:     The research findings were first published in 2004 when the Department       for Education and Skills produced a strategic paper entitled `Putting         the world into world-class education', drawing on the work of Johnes       and by The Times Education Higher `UK         market worth &#163;10 billion', citing Johnes analysis of income       generated by overseas students and the purchase of goods and services       whilst in education.
The Higher Education Adviser at the British Council       corroborates that `this headline figure was quoted by several government       departments and Ministers and at many British Council events and in       publications'.
The Economist at BIS, who was on the project steering group, corroborates       that `Johnes work was very helpful to this group in establishing a         credible estimate of the scale of UK exports of education and training         that was useful for the British Council in making its case for the         importance of education and training and helped UK Trade and Investment         (UKTI) in its prioritisation between sectors.'
The study has since       been updated twice, both heavily citing the 2004 study and the methodology       developed at Lancaster.
As time passed and inflation and student numbers increased BIS decided to       update the figures, using Johnes' methodology, to produce more timely       values.
The first update was in 2007 by Pamela Lenton at the British       Council entitled `Global         value: the value of UK education and training exports, an update'       and Johnes was invited to conduct the 2007 revision of the study (see       corroborating e-mail from British Council).
In 2011 the work was updated       again in BIS Research Paper 46 by Gavan Conlon, Annabel Litchfield and       Greg Sadlier (prepared by London Economics) entitled `Estimating         the value to the UK of education exports' and Johnes was again       invited to review the work.
Impact on UK government policy and strategy:     The work has been cited in a variety of government documents, including a       BIS Economics Paper (8) in 2010, `UK         trade performance: patterns in UK and global trade growth'.
The research findings have also been referred to frequently in       parliament, most recently by the Minister for State for Universities and       Science, Rt Hon David Willetts MP: `Research         published by BIS estimates the total value of education exports to the         UK at &#163;14.1 billion (in 2008/09) and forecasts that total UK education         exports could rise to &#163;17.6 billion in 2015 and &#163;26.6 billion by 2025'       (on 5th December 2011).
This estimate was obtained using       Johnes' methodology and was again employed by BIS for their `International         Education: Global Growth and Prosperity' report in July 2013.
In a       section of a speech to Universities UK in September 2012 entitled       `Industrial strategy and education exports', Willetts emphasised the role       of education as a `great British export industry'.
Student visa debate:     The work done by BIS, using Johnes' methodology, has also served as input       into the debate on student visas, with the million+ group of universities       using this as evidence       to support its argument that international students should not be treated       as migrants.
The million+ group has used the studies as evidence on       numerous other occasions &#8212; for example, its then chair, Les Ebdon, cited       the work in his evidence       to the BIS Committee on 29th March, 2011.
The data produced by       these exercises have been reported to parliament on several occasions,       providing evidence of the value of education exports to the UK.
The       updates to the original research have also been used in this debate by       Graham Able and Fraser White in their report, `Education:         a Great British Export?'
(March 2012).
Potential beneficiaries       therefore include &#8212; as well as government &#8212; universities and overseas       students themselves, whose ability mutually to benefit from trade is       determined by the availability of visas.
The debate on student visas is       ongoing at the time of writing, so the extent of benefit is currently       unclear.
NUS president Liam Burns, for example, cited the potential cost of       stripping a university of its ability to recruit students, given the value       of higher education as an export industry, when interviewed on the Today         programme on Radio 4 on 30th August, 2012 in relation to       the revoking of         London Metropolitan University's licence to authorise visas.
London Economics have also provided evidence       to the BIS Committee, using Johnes' methodology, on the likely impacts of       changes in undergraduate tuition fees, and this has included an assessment       of the impact on educational exports.
Ongoing impact:     Following the work on `the global value' project, Johnes was invited to       participate in a Vision2020 steering group called with members from the       British Council, academics and representatives from Australia to discuss       the forecasting of overseas student numbers.
The work related indirectly       to the `global value' project as it entailed forecasting some of the data       used in that project.
Johnes was subsequently a very active participant in       this group.
Other work in the area of the economics of education has likewise had an       impact.
For example, work on cost structures and mergers in higher       education has had input into the Welsh Assembly Government's deliberations       on the future shape of higher education in North Wales.
Johnes served on       the `Webb         Review' of higher education and a report with the findings from the       review         was submitted to the minister in June 2013.
It is, however, too       early to evaluate the impact of this work.
