     Our group has achieved its impact through three main mechanisms: (1) Via       the University of Edinburgh's Institute of Governance, co-directed       by McCrone and now Rosie, which has been both an engine of research (eg       the Leverhulme work was based there) and a platform for consultation and       briefing for wider public audiences.
It is committed to informing wider       public, policy and political debate, and has a strong track record of       liaising and working with the Scottish Government, the Scottish       Parliament, MSPs and parliamentary staff, Scottish and UK civil servants,       business, the media and others.
(2) Via the long-running journal Scottish           Affairs, which publishes work which spans academia, journalism       and commentary from professional life (freely available online since May       2009).
It has become the leading publication forum for discussion of       Scottish current affairs and serious debate about the country's future,       and from 2014 will be published by Edinburgh University Press.
Bond,       McCrone and Rosie are all Associate Editors.
(3) Via High-profile ad         hoc events such as the 2009 Institute of Governance conference, Ten         Years of the Scottish Parliament (which included a recorded debate       broadcast on BBC Radio Scotland), and a Bilbao meeting in 2013 in which       McCrone gave the keynote speech and shared the platform with the Prime       Minister of Euskadi (the Basque country) and the Speaker of the Basque       Parliament.
For example, for around 15 years, McCrone and colleagues (often in       conjunction with the Scottish Centre for Social Research) have provided       around three to four annual `Chatham House rule' round-table research       briefings/discussions at the Institute of Governance [5.1].
Each of these       briefings typically involves around 20 delegates, for example from       organisations such as government bodies, the Scottish Parliament, private       companies, NGOs (eg the Electoral Reform Society and the Scottish Council       for Voluntary Organisations), etc.
The briefings provide a non- partisan       environment for knowledge exchange, including on controversial matters       such as national identity and attitudes to independence.
For instance,       they have been attended by personnel from both sides of the independence       debate: the 'Better Together' and 'Yes Scotland' campaigns.
Activities such as these briefings (and also, eg, an international       interns programme linking the Institute of Governance with the Scottish       Parliament) have had the effect of making our research well known in       Scottish political/policy and media circles.
Ad hoc events, international       visitors to our group and its publications have also brought this research       into the public domain in other countries, especially those in which       similar issues of sub-state nationalism are important.
Evidence of this       impact includes:            Multiple invitations to brief political figures (eg the Premier of         Qu&#233;bec in January 2013) and to address or brief public/policy bodies (eg         the House of Commons' Welsh Affairs Committee, Royal College of Defence         Studies, the Scottish Human Rights Commission, Sardinian         parliamentarians and civil servants, Danish civil servants).
Examples of         public bodies that regularly seek to be briefed by us include the UK         Delegation of the Government of Catalonia and the UK D&#233;l&#233;gation G&#233;n&#233;rale         of Qu&#233;bec.
Group members are frequently approached by the press to give their         views on current events, or their research is quoted in newspaper         articles, both in the UK (eg Daily Telegraph, Sunday Post,         Scotsman, Herald) and internationally (eg the Melbourne Age,         Ireland's Sunday Business Post, the Spanish press agency, Europa           Press).
For an indicative set of examples, see an analysis of the         press coverage of the work of David McCrone, prepared with the help of         the University of Edinburgh Press and Public Relations Office [5.2].
Group members are also asked, eg, to be interviewed on or otherwise         advise TV and radio programmes (eg on ITV, Spain's RTVE network, the         South African Broadcasting Commission and Radio 4).
Three indicative examples of our group's impact on the `public       conversations' concerning nationalism and national identity are:     (1) McCrone's research being sought out by Gordon Brown and the         Cabinet Office; testimony to the impact of his research on Scottish         politics and the Scottish media.
McCrone's Chatham House rule briefings have made him prominent in Scottish       political life.
In 2008, triggered by an article written with Bechhofer       for the 24th British Social Attitudes report (see       section 3), McCrone was sought out, via a Minister in the Scottish       Government, by then Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who has a strong interest       in questions of national identity in Britain.
McCrone was asked by Brown       to throw light on various issues about social and geographic mobility in       Scotland and the distribution of kin relations across the Scottish/English       border; the result was an exchange of handwritten letters between McCrone       and Brown.
In April 2013, McCrone was asked to provide a detailed briefing       on questions of national identity and constitutional change to the       Coalition Government's Cabinet Office, which he did in a two-hour session       with top civil servants in June 2013 [5.3].
In November 2008, McCrone was named in the Scotsman as one of 12       'academics [who] are helping to shape our political future' [5.4].
[text       removed for publication] commented in August 2013 on the impact on Scottish politics and       the Scottish media of McCrone's research: `Academics have many goals.
One,       perhaps, is to sustain intellectual rigour while attaining relevance in       wider society.
Professor David McCrone has consistently achieved both.
His       research provides acute, insightful analysis which reflects society and       politics back to all of us.
It has been widely cited and deployed by       leading political figures and the media' [5.5].
(2) Rosie appointed to Scottish Government's Advisory Group           on Tackling Sectarianism.
In response to continuing concerns over Protestant-Catholic sectarian       conflict, the Scottish Government set up this group in 2012 to advise       Ministers on all issues bearing on sectarianism in Scotland.
Among the       tasks given to the group is to identify appropriate ways of combating       sectarianism at a community level, and it makes decisions on the funding       of proposed projects from community groups and other bodies, with &#163;3m of       funding allocated by June 2013 [5.6].
It also commissions original       research, for instance a &#163;100k project on the community impact of marches       and parades in Scotland, commissioned in January 2013 [5.7].
Rosie was       appointed to help `ensure evidence is rigorously challenged before it is       accepted' because of his `longstanding research interest in sectarianism'       (see section 3) [5.8].
His role includes briefing Scotland's Cabinet       Ministers and senior civil servants.
According to [text removed for publication] the       Advisory Group plays `a vital role in shaping our future policy on       sectarianism by assessing evidence, evaluating current and future projects       and providing advice to [...] Ministers on sectarian matters'.
[text       removed for publication] notes Rosie's `considerable knowledge and experience' in the       field of sectarianism [5.9].
Rosie has, eg, also been invited to chair the       official launch event of the Scottish Government's Action on Sectarianism       web portal.
(3) Bond's research discussed at First Minister's Questions, Scottish         Parliament.
In a context of public concern about demographic trends in Scotland       (population decline, `brain drain', etc.
), the Scottish Executive and ESRC       funded six research projects on these topics, including a case study of       graduate migration and retention led by Ross Bond.
A resulting 2010       publication in the Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies (see       section 3) was picked up by the Sunday Times Scotland and then       repeated in the Scotsman in April 2010.
Both stories chose to       focus narrowly on the observation in the article that anti-English       sentiments expressed toward undergraduates from England could weaken the       capacity of Scotland to retain highly skilled English undergraduates.
This       was presented in the newspapers as evidence of a problem of anti- English       racism in Scottish universities.
Bond promptly wrote a letter, published       in the Scotsman the next day, correcting misrepresentations of the       research, and making clear that while the research identified some       anti-English sentiments, these did not appear to be significant factors in       English students' decisions about where to settle after graduation, and       that many English students came to feel an affinity with Scotland.
The       following day the whole issue was raised in the Scottish Parliament at       First Minister's Questions, by MSP Ian McKee.
In the ensuing exchange,       First Minister Alex Salmond discussed the original research article and       referred in detail to Bond's letter to the Scotsman dispelling the       errors in the press coverage [5.10].
Note re testimony: Bonney (author of the Scotsman article), [text       removed for publication] are reporters on the impact, not involved in the process of its       delivery (except via [text removed for publication] role as a Minister advised by Rosie).
