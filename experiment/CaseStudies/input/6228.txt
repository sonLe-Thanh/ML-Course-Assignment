     Hussey's research into the interrelations between French and North       African culture has been disseminated through books, newspapers, radio and       magazines, leading to enhanced public awareness of and engagement with       issues of historical and political context.
Throughout his academic       career, Hussey has been committed to communicating his work beyond an       academic audience, not just in the UK but internationally.
The reach of Hussey's impact is evidenced by a series of       BBC Radio documentaries based on this research.
They are:     Queer Tangier (Broadcast, BBC Radio 4, August 30th       2013) &#8212; a documentary on the history of American and European       avant-gardists in Tangier.
Morocco, Maliki and Me (Broadcast, BBC World Service, September 15th,       2013)     Albert Camus, Inside the Outsider (Broadcast, BBC Radio 3,       November 13th, 2013)     The BBC estimates an audience of c. 1.5 million for the Radio 3 and Radio       4 of these programs.
10 million is estimated for the BBC World Service.
The documentary on Albert Camus is the centerpiece of BBC Radio 3's       centenary for Camus, and includes interviews by Hussey with Catherine       Camus, Jean Daniel, Olivier Todd, David Walker, Geoff Dyer.
Hussey talked       about the documentary on Camus at the Cheltenham Literary Festival on       October 8th 2013.
