     Researchers from the University of Oxford's Mahidol-Oxford Research Unit,       Thailand (MORU), were the first to expose the full extent of artemisinin       resistance in western Cambodia, prompting urgent action from local       governments and the WHO7.
The Unit's longitudinal study showing       the spread of resistance to the Thailand-Myanmar border confirmed the       ferociousness of the problem, prompting further action and funding from       health authorities and governments around the world for rapid research and       containment programmes.
Following the publication of MORU's June 20093       paper on artemisinin resistance in western Cambodia the WHO released a Global         report on antimalarial drug efficacy and drug resistance: 2000-20108,       which cites MORU's 2009 study as key evidence to artemisinin resistance.
This research also provided evidence for the WHO's definition of       resistance, characterised by slow rates of parasite clearance8.
MORU's July 20094 paper also provided evidence to the WHO that       measures can be taken in the clinic to prevent the spread of resistance8.
The study was cited in the WHO's Global report on antimalarial drug         efficacy and drug resistance: 2000-20108, which       emphasised the need for correct prescribing, adherence to prescribed drug       regimens, and provision of effective treatment regimens, particularly       among hyperparasitaemic patients.
In 2011 the WHO released its Global         plan for artemisinin resistance containment (GPARC)9 - a       worldwide "call to action" for the prevention of further resistance.
The       GPARC report cites evidence from MORU4 studies and recommends       several courses of action, reflecting MORU's key strategies5       for the containment of malaria resistance, including9:     &#8212; Stopping the spread of resistant parasites, e.g.
mass screening and       drug administration in target areas;     &#8212; Increasing monitoring and surveillance to evaluate the threat of       artemisinin resistance;     &#8212; Improving access to diagnostics and rational treatment with ACTs;     &#8212; Investing in artemisinin resistance-related research; and     &#8212; Motivating action and mobilising resources (from stakeholders at       global, regional, and national levels)9.
As a result of the University of Oxford's research and the subsequent       call to action from the WHO, a number of government organisations have       pledged assistance for further research into artemisinin resistance in       Southeast Asia.
The UK Department for International Development has set up       the Artemisinin Resistant Malaria Program appointing MORU as the       lead research institute on the project.
The aim of this collaborative       program is to rapidly identify and geographically contain artemisinin       resistance, in order to prevent its spread to other parts of Southeast       Asia and Africa10.
As part of this program the Tracking         Resistance to Artemisinin Collaboration was launched in January       2011, to investigate the spread of parasite resistance to       artemisinin-based therapies in western Cambodia, and on the Thailand       Myanmar border11.
MORU's 2012 study, which emphasised the       global threat of artemisinin resistance, has received worldwide media       attention from Reuters12 and TIME magazine13, to The       Times of India14, and the Deccan Herald (India)15.
Such widespread media attention has highlighted the problem of resistance,       encouraging charities and investors to support global containment       programs.
This media attention has also improved social understanding of       the problem in high-risk areas, such as India.
Increased funding for research into artemisinin resistance has led to       ground-breaking outcomes in the genetic understanding of malaria       parasites.
A recent discovery from Oxford University researchers,       published in April 2013, shows that malaria parasites in western Cambodia       are genetically different from the strains of parasites found in other       parts of the world, such as Africa.
These findings will make it possible       for health care workers to track the resistant strains of malaria       parasites as they emerge, and to develop an appropriate response16.
