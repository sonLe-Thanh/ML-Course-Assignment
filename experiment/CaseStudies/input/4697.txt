     Ministers expressed concern that about 5,000 children were waiting for       suitable adoptive parents when there was a lack of adoptive parents and       that the research clearly identified the fee as contributing to structural       problems in the system.
Selwyn was invited to Downing Street to join a       `round table' on child welfare policy; she became one of the key advisors       to HM Treasury's review of adoption and was the only academic advisor on       the Government's Expert Working Group on Adoption [c].
The Parliamentary       Under Secretary of State for Children, Young People and Families sent a       letter (2009) to all Directors of Children's Services stating:     "I am writing to draw your attention to a report on adoption and the         inter-agency fee...The report raises some challenging but helpful         questions about the way some local authorities structure their budgets         for children in care and commission adoptive placements" [d].
A year later (2010) The Minister quoted the findings in a letter sent to       Directors of Children's Services "Despite all the evidence &#8212; most         notably in Dr Julie Selwyn's report last year on adoption and the         inter-agency fee &#8212; there still seems to be a widespread view that making         use of voluntary adoption agencies should be seen as a last resort...
I         want to see more collaborative working and effective partnerships"       [e].
The Minister referred to the findings in Statutory Guidance (2010) on       the new `Sufficiency duty' [f] and in his Foreword to Statutory Adoption       Guidance wrote: "Many voluntary adoption agencies specialise, and are         successful, in finding families for children who are perceived as         difficult to place... And there is clear evidence that there is little         difference in the cost of placing a child with the local authority's own         adopters and adopters from a voluntary adoption agency.
In many cases,         it will yield savings for the local authority and free up a fostering         placement...".
[g]     Government signalled its intention to legislate to change the structure       of adoption services quoting the research findings [h].
Selwyn gave a       presentation to the House of Lords Select Committee on adoption       legislation and was recalled to give oral evidence       (20/11/2011;19/06/2012).
She also appeared before the Children and       Families Bill Committee (legislative scrutiny) to give oral evidence in       the House of Commons.
In 2013, the DfE published `Further Action on       Adoption' again quoting the study and stating:     "The rapid growth in the numbers of children waiting on placement         orders in recent years suggests that the adoption system is not         effective in translating increases in the numbers going through the         system into increased incentives on agencies to recruit and assess.
This         analysis of the structure of the system helps to explain why.
It         demonstrates that the real improvement we need cannot happen while         provision is dominated by 152 local authorities trying to recruit and         approve only the adopters they immediately need and around 30 voluntary         agencies artificially limited by the reluctance of local authorities to         use their adopters."
[i]     The Government called for rapid change in practice and stated that a new       statutory power would be acquired to remove adoption services from local       authorities if they did not remove systemic barriers constraining the       recruitment of adopters.
In 2013, Government announced an additional &#163;16       million for the expansion of the VAA sector [j].
In response, the Association of Directors of Children's Services, the       Local Government Association and the Society of Local Authority Chief       Executives announced that one of the steps they intended to take was swift         progress on the levelling of the inter-agency fee, describing it as       a systematic disincentive to adopter recruitment.
Their joint statement       stated that by September 2013, all LAs should have implemented a single       fee set at the higher VAA rate [k].
Media coverage     Extensive media coverage followed the study launch 2009-2010 (The       Guardian, The Times, The Telegraph, Local Government Chronicle, Children       and Young People Now, Communitycare.co.uk).
Selwyn gave live interviews to       Radio 5 and Radio 4 Women's Hour.
Findings were comprehensively cited in a       Policy Exchange report on adoption and in a key Demos report on the care       system [l].
Influenced an appeal to the Charity Commission     Selwyn provided evidence in 2011 in the case of the Charity Commission v       Catholic Care (VAA).
The VAA argued that unless it were permitted to       discriminate against gay/lesbian prospective adopters, it would no longer       be able to raise the voluntary income from its supporters on which it       relied to run the adoption service, and it would therefore have to close       its adoption service.
The Charity advanced a case of proportionate       discrimination in order to achieve a legitimate aim and argued it should       be exempted from equality legislation.
Selwyn was called as a witness and       evidence was used from the study to argue against Catholic Care's case.
[m]     "The Tribunal concluded that... the Charity's case was... contradicted         by evidence presented to the Tribunal of the dominant influence that         local authority funding arrangements have on the work of the voluntary         adoption agencies and the inability of the voluntary adoption agency         sector to overcome the problems created by that system through its own         practice...in all the circumstances and having considered the evidence         carefully, the Tribunal has unanimously decided to dismiss the Charity's         appeal."
(para 61)     This forced all the 12 Catholic VAAs to change their literature and       practice and prevented further appeals to be exempt from equality       legislation.
There has since been a growth in the number of gay/lesbian       adopters [a].
Impact on social work practice     2012-2013 saw an increase in the number of children adopted and was the       highest figure since records of adoptions from care began in 1992.
This       represented an increase of 20% on the previous year while the care       population as a whole grew only 2% over the same time period.
There was       also greater use of VAAs who placed more children for adoption than in any       of the previous 10 years: exceeding the previous year by 20% [a].
The       research evidence had clearly shown that the inter-agency fee was a major       barrier to effective collaboration, that perceptions that VAAs were       expensive were false and that the fee acted as a deterrent for agencies to       recruit more adoptive parents.
Government ministers accepted the findings       and strongly encouraged the sector to remove the disincentive and       supported VAAs to grow, investing &#163;16 million in the expansion.
A strong       voluntary sector was seen as crucial to sustainable reform of the adoption       system.
The intention being to ensure that enough adoptive parents were       recruited and that children were placed with adoptive parents who best met       their needs, not adoptive parents who appeared to cost the least.
