     BEAA's research on oat genetics has made a significant contribution to       the breeding of innovative       oat varieties that have had considerable impact [5.1].
Oat breeding within       BEAA also formed part       of the award of the Queens Anniversary Prize for 2009 that was awarded to       Aberystwyth University       [5.2] in recognition of combining fundamental research on plant genetics       with plant breeding       techniques to develop new commercially viable plant varieties that are       designed to tackle some of       the pressing issues faced by communities across the world, those of food,       water and energy       security.
Impacts on health and welfare:       Public awareness of the merits of healthy food and the health benefits of       consuming oats has       increased over recent years.
This coincides with the publication of the       health claim on oats by the       EU [5.3] that accepts that eating oats contributes to a reduced risk of       coronary heart disease       because of their &#946;-glucan content.
BEAA's research on variation in       &#946;-glucan content in oats has       identified sources of high &#946;-glucan that has been incorporated into the       winter and spring oat       breeding programmes, providing suitable varieties for the UK milling       industry.
The BEAA oat       breeding programmes account for approximately 65% of the oats used within       the UK [5.4] and       varieties from that programme contribute to market diversification in oat       based products within the       breakfast cereal market and for snacks or light meals for consumers.
There       is a growing demand in       the UK for on-the-go convenient breakfast foods.
As a result, consumers       are increasingly opting for       cereal bars, instant porridge and other breakfast solutions.
The oat       varieties bred by BEAA are       marketed through a strategic alliance with the company Senova [5.5].
The       utility of the new oat       varieties in terms of milling quality is tested in collaboration with the       British Oat and Barley Millers       Association, which represents the major oat milling companies within the       UK.
In 2012, the quantity       of oats used within the UK was ca.700,000t of which 65,000t was imported,       with 450,000t milled for       human food consumption [5.4].
Impacts on commerce:        BEAA oat varieties based on our research activities [section 2] account       for approximately 65% of       the oats used in the UK and have a significant impact on the agriculture       sector.
The instant market       for oats in the UK as of May 2013 is worth more than &#163;120 million, with       "Oats So Simple" alone       worth &#163;97.3 million [5.6] and is now the 3rd most valuable       cereal in the UK.
Porridge sales are &#163;40       million putting the UK market for hot oat cereals at over &#163;160 million.
The BEAA oat varieties also       impact on other sectors: the ready to eat cereals, granolas and mueslis       market is approximately       worth &#163;19 million and bars and biscuits nearly &#163;10 million.
Sales of       oat-based products are       increasing at 5% per annum.
BEAA research thus contributes to the improved       human diet as a       consequence of the increasing popularity of oats in the retail market.
Economic impact is not only       in the UK as the UK is also a major exporter of oat products into Europe,       the Middle East, Africa       and Asia; 55% of the output of the QUAKER mill at Cupar is exported and       almost all as packed       retail products.
In the UK the majority of the oat crop comprises BEAA's winter oat       varieties; spring oats represent       ca.
25% of the crop.
The Crop Evaluation Limited Recommended List (RL) of       winter oats is       currently dominated by BEAA varieties (eg 100% in 2012).
The winter oat       variety Mascani, bred by       BEAA (RL listed in 2004), is currently the most widely grown, accounting       for nearly 50% of the       current winter oat seed sales [5.7] with 60,000ha of land sown for       production of this variety.
Two       BEAA bred spring oat varieties (Glamis and Conway) are currently on the UK       National List and are       in RL trials.
The oat crop is used for human food and also for animal       feed; the BEAA breeding       programme introduced the `naked oat' types in which the husks thresh free       from the groat during       harvesting, and these are favoured as feed for pigs and poultry.
The BEAA       naked oat breeding       programme has bred varieties with high oil content and high ME value       making them a quality       animal feedstuff.
Three (of 9) RL varieties of winter oats and one spring       oat (Lennon) listed in 2012       are naked oat varieties bred by BEAA [5.7], further emphasising the impact       of the BEAA breeding       programme on the diversification of the market for the oat crop.
The       merits of these naked oat       varieties, marketed by Agrii [5.8] are listed in the UK RL guide 2012/2013       [5.7].
Approximately       8500t were produced in 2012 with 18.8% going to the poultry sector, 14.1%       to pet food, 9.9% for       bird food, 16.4% for pigs and 40.8% for horses and malting.
Impact on production:       The BEAA research on dwarfing genes in oats has enabled the development of       dwarf varieties,       such as Balado, added to the UK RL in 2010, that reduce the risk of       lodging [5.9], and the need to       apply plant growth regulators to control plant height.
This is evidenced       by the relative performance       of dwarf oats in comparison with conventional height oats with and without       plant growth regulator       (PGR) treatment [5.9].
Balado is the highest yielding winter oat currently       on this list [5.7].
The dwarf       oats have a significant impact on the production of oats and on the       milling industry where grain       without PGR is increasingly important, particularly for the export market       to Scandinavia [5.6].
Research on disease resistance has also enabled varieties with improved       resistance (such as       Mascani) to be bred, reducing the need for fungicide application.
The UK       Recommended List for       Cereals [5.7] 2012/2013 provides details of the disease resistance of the       different varieties
