     Context: The Life ECOnet project has brought benefit to the three       study areas: Cheshire, UK; Emilio-Romagna, Italy; Abruzzo, Italy.
The ecological network created in Abruzzo featured as a case study in         an ECNC (European Centre for Nature Conservation) report [a].
Since 2008 the key impacts of the research have been seen in the         development and implementation of planning policy in the UK and China.
The work in Cheshire on the ECOnet, the original concept for which was         developed by James, has been included in a report by The Parliamentary         Office of Science and Technology [b] as a case study indicating         good practice in developing local ecological networks.
The wider ECOnet         work in Cheshire led to a &#163;3 Million investment in the Sandstone Ridge         ECOnet Partnership (SREP): the implementation phase of the project         covering a potential chain of interconnected woodland networks,         alternating with two interconnected heathland networks and two isolated         peatland networks.
The ideas developed in this work are now embedded within the Lawton         Report, Making Space for Nature [c] and in the Natural           Environment White Paper.
A direct result of the Life ECOnet         project was the inclusion in the North West Regional Planning documents         that all local authorities covered by the plan should develop an         Ecological Framework.
The Greater Manchester Ecological Framework         (GMEF), completed in 2008, was adopted into the planning system of         Greater Manchester, for example by incorporation into the Greater         Manchester Minerals Plan and was a forerunner of work on the Green         Infrastructure of Greater Manchester [d] and in work informing         the Natural Economy Northwest initiative (NENW) [e].
Working in partnership with Red Rose Forest (RRF), a Community Forest         serving Greater Manchester, the Forestry Commission and Natural England,         James's work from the Greater Manchester Ecological Framework (GMEF) has         been used to develop the overall approach to the Greater Manchester         Green Infrastructure (GI) Framework [f].
This work has shown how         different datasets may be brought together to model the benefits GI         could bring to the City-Region.
It also highlighted the importance of         ways to improve the `urban matrix', work Red Rose Forest pursues with         street tree planting [g,h] and other interventions (including         green roof creation).
The GMEF approach has been used in two major area strategies, the         Trafford Forest Plan and the Manchester City Centre Green and Blue         Infrastructure Plan.
The University joined with the Red Rose Forest's         Greater Manchester Tree Audit Consortium, helping this ambitious idea         become a reality, and the use of the Greater Manchester Tree Audit is         yielding useful data to develop the Audit as a `live' project.
The work         on ecosystem services has also helped formulate the approach for a new         piece of work identifying and prioritising Ecosystem Services for the         Mosslands area to the west of Salford.
This work is informing the         development of a Local Nature Improvement Area (the Great Manchester         Wetlands) and a significant funding application to the Heritage Lottery         Fund which is currently being written.
The research programme in Halton began in 2005 and as a result of the         early work the management of the ponds and urban trees within the         borough has been modified.
Since 2008 the work has focussed on the         movement of species in the borough and on the saltmarsh.
The outputs of         the work on species movement was used in informing the decision making         process related to the planning approval for the &#163;600 million second         Mersey Crossing bridge.
The work on the saltmarsh focused on the         ecosystem services associated with the environmental mitigation over         1,700 ha of land and estuary which will flow from the construction of         the bridge [i].
In China, the main impact of Professor James's work is seen in the         planning and design of a new development in the Xicheng District in the         centre of Bejing.
Xicheng is a major commercial district in central         Beijing.
Professor James's work is breaking new ground as this is the         first time that urban eco-system services and urban ecological concerns         have been incorporated so prominently in a practical masterplan project         in China.
This work has established the principles of integrating urban         eco-system services into the masterplanning agenda for this area.
In         particular, the proposal for creating a series of linked urban green         spaces (some of which span an existing urban ring road) has attracted         keen interest from the Xicheng government.
At the time of the writing         the proposals are being further studied by the policy makers in Xicheng.
