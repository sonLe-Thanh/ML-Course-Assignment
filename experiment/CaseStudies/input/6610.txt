      The research undertaken by the Centre has had a         significant impact on the journey Scotland has taken in relation to         sustainable waste management practices, in particular in relation to the         increase in recycling.
With REMADE Scotland as a major programme to         provide evidential research to help formulate waste policy in Scotland,         the country has moved from 4% recycling in 1998 to over 40% of household         waste being recycled in 2011.
The impact on the Scottish economy is         significant.
The REMADE Scotland programme showed that:             4,500 new jobs in the waste sector had been created           and sustained;        The number of waste related businesses has doubled           in Scotland        In 2012 the Scottish waste sector is estimated to           have earned &#163;1.2bn.
This represents a significant impact on the Scottish         economy over the period.
The evidential research produced by REMADE         Scotland provided much of the intervention and support to Scottish         agencies to deliver the shift towards greater resource recovery.
Two         areas of intervention where the Centre's work had significant impact are         given as follows:                      Finding               feedstock and markets for organic wastes material - one of             the consequences of early legislative changes which introduce limits             on the amount of organic waste going to landfill, was the             construction of mechanical biological treatment (MBT) facilities,             several were constructed in Scotland through Private Finance             Initiatives and standard procurementroutes.
These MBT facilities             were viewed as alternatives to incineration.
The consequence was the             production of a biowaste output, which under Waste Framework             Directive would still need to treated as waste and in accordance             with a waste permit.
Our research published in 2005 resulted in             guidance being produced for the Scottish Government (andfound on             Scottish Government website -http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/06/1483953/39542               ) which set out the main criteria for using the stabilised             biowaste material on the restoration of old landfill sites.
This             work continues to provide a methodology for considering how organic             waste can be safely applied to land.
Since 2010 Government interest has moved to the         treatment of organic material by anaerobic digestion (AD).
The west of         Scotland alone has 3 recently built AD plants each capable of processing         60kt of waste per year.
All three facilities were advised by the Centre         on the amounts and locations of potential feedstock in support of their         operations.
Our research also included a national survey of wastes         arising in the hotel and restaurant sectors, the evidence of which has         supported a new national voluntary initiative for the hotel sector on         waste reduction.
Assessment of             recycling performance of Local authorities- Scottish           Government targets have focussed on local authorities, with all         32 Scottish local authorities being given recycling targets over the         past 12 years and as such, have had to reconfigure their waste           collection infrastructure.
One outcome from REMADE Scotland programme           was individual service level agreements with 20 authorities, valued at           &#163;250k per year over a three year period to provide bespoke support.
Advice was provided on alternating weekly collection of residual and           recyclable wastes, shifts in working patterns, collection crew and           vehicle requirements, the development of Material Recovery Facilities,           recycling centres and points.
At the same time the Scottish Government           established a Strategic Waste Fund,which relied on performance           modelling tools developed by the Centre in appraising bids from 29 of           the 32 Scottish local authorities.
In effect these tools were used in           the determination and approval of &#163;65m per year of Government funding           into these Scottish local authorities.
The tools helped ensure value           for money and maximum recycling performance was achieved.
The Centre           also undertook annual reviews of recycling performance across all 32           councils, presenting evidence on best practice.
This led to a           reduction in the number of different services being provided by           Councils, to ensure maximum recycling performance and best value                     Perhaps of most significance is that the Remade         Scotland programme was the first waste research and market intervention         programme in the UK.
A similar model was later adopted by Clean         Merseyside Centre, Remade Essex, Urban Mines in Yorkshire, London         Remade.
The Waste and Resources Action         Programme was launched two years after, using the same model, and with         over &#163;250m funding, has become the UK         Government's principal agency in support of a material efficient       economy.
