     This research has informed antislavery debate, policy and practice on the       part of 1) the European Parliament; 2) NGOs; 3) specific communities (of       teachers and lawyers).
Influencing the debates of the European Union       Trodd's research (reference 4) has had an impact on the       antislavery discourse of the European Union.
She presented the findings of       her commissioned study (reference 4) to the European Parliament's       Subcommittee on Human Rights on July 10, 2013, then engaged in an exchange       of views with Myria Vassiliadou, the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator.
The       study assessed the EU's antislavery efforts so far and recommended new       courses of action, including an EU Directive on Transparency in Supply       Chains, national anti-slavery plans and slavery inspectorates for Member       States, a systematic regulation of labour recruitment agencies, a better       use of historic antislavery imagery in its own reports and resources       (rather than its current use of famous 19th-century icons like       the crouching, pleading slave from "Am I Not a Man and a Brother"), and       dozens of other recommendations centred around the suggestion that the EU       shift its focus from just trafficking (the process of enslavement)       to slavery itself, and do so with reference to earlier forms of slavery       and antislavery.
In response, the Vice-Chair of the Subcommittee on Human       Rights, Metin Kazak, said he wanted to "underline the message of the paper       that there is a clear recommendation to the EU to cease referring to       trafficking as slavery and rather recognise trafficking as a       method by which a minority of the world's slaves are brought to slavery" (source         1).
MEPs then debated the value of this proposed shift.
Here Trodd       introduced a new element to the EU's debate on its approach to combatting       contemporary slavery and human trafficking.
Other policy recommendations       have the potential for impact over the next two-three years.
Making suggestions to NGOs about elements of their abolitionism       Trodd presented research to antislavery NGOs about how best to translate       the lessons and methods of 19th-century abolitionism and       antislavery writing into 21st-century antislavery strategies       and campaigns.
The NGOs with which Trodd engaged subsequently changed an       element of their approach.
As well as her own research into antislavery       imagery and contemporary slave narratives (reference 3), she used       that of Ashworth (reference 2) to suggest that antislavery       organisations should support grassroots organisations that empower       enslaved people to take and sustain their own freedom, rather than       organisations that buy people out of slavery; and that of Newman (reference         1) to suggest that organisations should work to gather the       narratives of contemporary slaves, publish them without what Newman terms       the "straitjacket" of editorial interference and authenticating       testimonials by sponsors, and make the slave narrative as central to       contemporary abolitionism as it was to 19th-century antislavery       efforts.
Free the Slaves (the leading American antislavery NGO) applied the         suggestions based on Trodd and Newman's research into slave narratives         by launching a digital collection of testimonies (source 2).
The Frederick Douglass Family Initiatives (FDFI) (a high-profile         antislavery NGO run by Frederick Douglass' direct descendants) applied         the advice based on Trodd's research into antislavery imagery in its         contributions to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History's         National Youth Summit on Abolition, held on February 11, 2013, and         attended by 4200 high school students and teachers from the U.S., Kenya,         Canada, Pakistan, Malta and Brazil onsite and online.
The FDFI         president, Kenneth B. Morris (Douglass' great-great-great-grandson)         participated in the panel discussion and contributed material to the         summit's Conversation Kit, a document circulated a week in advance of         the event.
Here he applied Trodd's suggestions, quoting her directly (source           3, p.8).
Advice to The National Underground Railroad Freedom         Center (NURFC) (which is both a museum about the historic underground         railroad and a contemporary antislavery organization based in Ohio),         shaped its contributions to the same Summit, where it applied Trodd's         warning about sensationalising depictions of slavery, quoting her         directly (source 3, p.9).
John Brown Lives (JBL) (a human rights organisation based in upstate         New York) applied the suggestions based on Ashworth's research to         organize a public event in New York City in April 2013 where Trodd         discussed the potential value of the John Brown method (violent direct         action) and slave rebellion (central to Emancipation, as Ashworth has         argued), to today's antislavery efforts.
In direct response to this         event and the awareness it raised, New York City declared April 7&#8212;the         day of the event&#8212;John Brown Day.
A councilman proclaimed at the event         itself: "whereas John Brown.... is a figure of particular importance in         American history who spent his life fighting against the endemic         injustice of slavery and.... whereas an important event in recognition         of the efforts of Mr Brown is promoting knowledge through academic         discourse and educated discussion; now, therefore, April 7 is John Brown         Day" (source 4).
Creating a John Brown Day in New York that         highlights contemporary slavery and the antislavery strategy of armed         resistance and slave rebellion has, according to the Executive Director         of JBL, "engaged the communities of New York in the freedom history of         their region, promoted social justice and human rights, and encouraged         people to see who else is out there working on the question of human         equality today" (source 5).
Initiating the establishment of Britain's first antislavery taskforce       Following a lecture and seminar on contemporary slavery (based on research       in reference 4) that Trodd delivered in May 2013 to the Young       Public Lawyers Group (an industry-wide London-based network that       facilitates links between public lawyers and hosts events of interest to       this sector), the group (with Trodd as Advisor) established Britain's       first antislavery taskforce.
The London-based taskforce is initially       comprised of lawyers and NGO representatives, and will also include       A&amp;E doctors, police, social workers and local government officials.
The task-force is training and planning for trafficking and slavery cases,       addressing and resolving areas of potential overlap or conflict, and       ensuring that open lines of communication exist.
As shown in the U.S.,       where most major cities have such a group, local taskforces smooth the       movement of survivors to appropriate service providers, increase the       viability of prosecutions, and raise levels of public awareness and       vigilance.
Helping teachers promote antislavery awareness among students       Trodd drew primary material from her research (references 3-5) to       publish a collection of contemporary slave narratives online at the       Antislavery Literature Project (ALP)&#8212;an educational non-profit that       provides free access to the literature and history of the antislavery       movement (source 6).
The collection was accessed 536,796 times (as       of July 2013), with 87,336 unique visits.
A "Contemporary Slavery       Teachers' Resource" and accompanying website produced by the International       Slavery Museum with support from UNESCO used Trodd's narratives as the       basis for case studies (source 7) and was accessed 17,552 times       online by July 2013.
The resource has been used by teachers to educate       students aged 10 to 14 in England and Wales on contemporary slavery as       part of their education in Citizenship.
Trodd also adapted her       research (references 3-5) for numerous public talks, including in       Portland, New Haven and New York in March and April 2013; for a Youtube       lecture posted on February 27, 2013 that had reached 9200 views and 142       comments by July 2013 (source 8); and for two different 2-day       courses for 50 high-school teachers in Boston about contemporary slavery       in March and July 2013.
The teachers went on to adapt the course content       for their own teaching (which reaches around 1200 students, with average       class sizes at 25 students).
The teachers shared their reflections on the       course and also the lesson plans they had written and used as a result,       demonstrating the impact on their teaching (source 9).
For       example, one teacher had asked her students to complete a project about       the products they use that are connected to slave labour, then asked the       students to write letters to newspapers about contemporary slavery.
Working with students rather than teachers, Trodd also adapted her       research (reference 5) for a Widening Participation session about       contemporary slavery offered to 30 high-achieving and low-income local       Year 12s in the Nottingham area (March 2013) and successfully supported       the pupils in developing new knowledge and understanding.
Before the       session, questioning of students revealed they knew nothing about the       topic.
In a follow-up survey a week later, all students were able to       explain important facts and figures about today's slavery (source 10).
