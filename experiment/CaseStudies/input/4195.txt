     Since 2008 the research in Stretch Blow Moulding has made a significant       impact on a number of multinational companies.
The global presence of       these companies and the volume of products they produce ensure that both       the reach and significance of the impact is felt on a global scale.
The impact of the underpinning research has resulted in new         technology, software and knowledge being integrated into the design         process of containers thus enabling them to lightweight them.
This       has direct savings to the companies through the usage of less material as       well as impact on the environment through less use of petroleum based       plastic and the transportation of lighter containers.
Economic Impact     Between 2003 and 2012, the [text removed for publication]       invested ~&#163;200,000 of funding to develop mathematical models of the       behaviour of PET during processing and of the stretch blow moulding       process.
The research has had a significant impact within [text         removed for publication] and beyond.
A letter of support from [text         removed for publication] Head of modelling &amp; simulation [text         removed for publication] (2002-2012) has confirmed that the know-how       generated contributed to the launch of:             Several innovative packaging formats in 20 countries covering           almost all continents of the world [text removed for           publication]        Several lightweight containers, including all sizes of the famous         [text removed for publication] brand (from 33cl to 1.5L),         [text removed for publication].
As an example on the savings to the business, the reduction of ~3g from a       1.5l [text removed for publication] PET bottle lead to more than       1800 tonnes of PET saved per year (basis: 600 million bottles production       on average).
The average cost of PET since 2009 is ~ &#8364;1700, equating to an       economic saving of ~&#8364;3M per year since 2009.
The research work with       QUB enabled [text removed for publication] to make decisions about       the effect of processing on material properties as well as numerical       simulation prediction, and thus made a significant and direct impact to       these savings.
The research has also enabled [text removed for         publication] to develop a new methodology for evaluating new       materials for stretch blow moulding, including non-oil based and         eco-friendly materials which is a key challenge for them in the future.
The investment in research has also contributed to the professional       development of the [text removed for publication] packaging team       including increasing the expertise of technicians, engineers and [text         removed for publication] managers in the field of stretch blow       moulding technology and the recruitment of 2 former PhD students of GM,       CA, EHJ and PM.
Between 2008 and 2012, the [text removed for publication] have       invested &#163;342,000 in research with QUB with the aim of developing an       accurate validated simulation of the stretch blow moulding process.
They         use this process to make over 20% of the 5 billion containers they sell         all over the world every year.
They currently use the simulation       software package as part of their virtual design process for their new and       existing products.
The stretch blow moulding model is an integral       component of their virtual package design system.
A quote from [text         removed for publication] use of tools related to Queen's program has         delivered, in the last year alone, at least $3 million in savings.
Moving forward [text removed for publication] expects these models to         deliver $25 million in annual savings"     A new spin out company Blow Moulding Technologies was created in       2012.
The product the company is selling (THERMOscan) is       based on patent pending technology and the research assistant who worked       on these projects is now the CEO of BMT.
The company has already sold 7       units [EU and USA] and turned over &#163;140,000 in 6 countries.
The       technology is enabling multinational companies such as Logoplaste,         Amcor and Procter &amp; Gamble to optimise their process setup,       saving them time, energy and money and provides them with new information       that enables a better understanding of their process and a more efficient       production of bespoke products.
Paulo Correia, the Director of         Logoplaste Innovation lab which is the R&amp;D centre for       Logoplaste's 63&#160; manufacturing plants based across the world,       highlights the impact the new technology has on the business "THERMOscan           enables us to setup our processes easier and faster.
With a new           insight on how preform design and materials are influencing the           heating process we are now able to take upon even more ambitious           projects."
Whilst [text removed for publication] has       said "Temperature measurements from THERMOscan have enabled more accurate       blow moulding simulations, improving our package design process".
A major       machine manufacturer, SOPLAR, based in Switzerland have purchased the       THERMOscan device.
On THERMOscan they quote "THERMOscan has been an         invaluable tool in helping us optimize and develop our IR-technology."
THERMOscan 	         Environmental Impact     The research also has an environmental impact through less use of         petroleum based plastic and the transportation of lighter         containers.
Taking the case study of the 1.5l [text removed for         publication] PET bottle [text removed for publication] the 1800         tonnes of PET saved per year on this container can be translated in       to a reduction of CO2 of ~ 800 tonnes/year.
Considering the savings of material made on other leading global brands as       highlighted in the economic impact it is clear that the environmental       impact has both reach and significance.
