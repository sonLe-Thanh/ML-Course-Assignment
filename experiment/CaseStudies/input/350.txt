     Micronutrients play a central part in metabolism and in the maintenance       of tissue function.
Micronutrient deficiencies adversely affect the health       of a large proportion of the world population and according to the WHO,       over 1.3 million children die each year because of micronutrient       deficiencies in three critical micronutrients that are most limiting in       the diet (iron, zinc, and vitamin A).
Inadequate micronutrient intake and       status is also a problem in industrialised countries especially in       relation to iron.
In sharp contrast, an excess intake of particular       micronutrients is associated with an increased risk of chronic disease,       exemplified by the association between dietary sodium intake and       cardiovascular disease.
WHO Guidelines: We provided core expertise in systematic       review methodology and meta- analysis for the WHO Guidance Expert Advisory       Group to assess the scientific data on the effects of potassium and sodium       intakes on human health.
On the basis of the research in (7), WHO       developed its first guideline for potassium intake.
This new guideline       (corroborating source A) states that:       `adults and children without compromised renal handling of potassium         should increase their potassium intake from food and that adults should         consume &gt;90 mmol potassium/d for beneficial effects on blood pressure         and risk of related cardiovascular disease'.
WHO recommends that this is adjusted downwards for children, based on       their relative energy requirements.
Our WHO committee work and BMJ meta-analysis (research reference 8) has       also informed the revision and update of the WHO guidelines for sodium       (corroborating source B) which states:     `WHO recommends a reduction in sodium intake to reduce blood pressure         and risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and coronary heart disease in         adults.
WHO recommends a reduction to &lt;2 g/day sodium (5 g/day         salt)'.
and established a new WHO guideline for children, which states:       `WHO recommends a reduction in sodium intake to control blood pressure         in children.
The recommended maximum level of intake of 2 g/day sodium         in adults should be adjusted downward based on the energy requirements         of children relative to those of adults'.
European Food Standards Authority (EFSA) work: There is no       uniform approach for establishing micronutrient recommendations, and the       large variations across Europe create confusion among consumers, food       producers and policy-makers.
The EFSA is the EU authority that provides       independent scientific advice on risk assessment associated with the food       chain.
EFSA reports - our pathway to impact: As a result of the EURECCA       work, UEA was awarded two tenders, where we were commissioned to collate       all scientific data from which DRVs may be derived for six trace elements       (magnesium, potassium, fluoride, chromium, manganese, and molybdenum).The       submitted reports are: Preparation of an evidence report         identifying health outcomes upon which Dietary Reference Values could         potentially be based for magnesium, potassium and fluoride.

(2012) Mullee A, Brown T, Collings R, Harvey     L, Hooper L, Fairweather-Tait S.     Final report CT/EFSA/NDA/03 Lot 2, University of East Anglia     (http://www.efsa.europa.eu/fr/supporting/pub/284e.htm)     The reports included detailed systematic searches and reviews of studies       relating to these micronutrients and used methodologies developed as part       of the EURRECA project.
These focussed on primary studies in humans, and       reported on the dose-response relationship between intakes of the       nutrients within the physiological (dietary) intake range and health       outcomes, upon which DRVs may be based.
EFSA opinions - impact on the formulation of Dietary Reference Values         for micronutrients: The reports are now the research base behind the       EFSA DRV Minerals Working Group's strategy to issue opinions (the       scientific committee's consensus documents) on Dietary Reference Values       for the population of the European Union.
Of the six micronutrients       reviewed in our EFSA-funded work, detailed draft opinions have       significantly advanced policy and have already been released by the EFSA       committee on two micronutrients, molybdenum and fluoride (corroborating       sources C and D).
The other EFSA opinions will be released in the 2013-14       period.
Our expertise in this area is also having impact on the development of       micronutrient nutrition policy/guidelines by individual nations.
One       example is the Nordic countries, who collectively set their nutritional       recommendations and dietary guidelines.
Professor Fairweather-Tait was       appointed to the international Reference Group for the development of the       NNR5 guidelines as a result of her micronutrient expertise and involvement       with developing the methodologies for EURRECA (http://www.slv.se/en-gb/Startpage-NNR/Reference-group/       ).
Micronutrient deficiencies - impact on food security: The world is       facing a potential crisis in terms of food security.
The challenge is to       produce and supply enough safe and nutritious food in a sustainable way       for a growing global population, which is projected to reach 9 billion by       2050.
Micronutrient deficiencies are a significant public health problem       in developing countries and Fairweather-Tait's EURRECA work has informed       the development of an international biofortification programme,       HarvestPlus, partly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation.
HarvestPlus is helping to develop breeding of staple foods that are a       better source of micronutrients, and works with key international       stakeholders in micronutrient research, including Fairweather-Tait.
In       order to define targets for the level of zinc needed in biofortified rice       or wheat to have an impact on health, HarvestPlus was informed by the       findings from a workshop organised by EURRECA on intake-status-health       relationships, and the systematic review of biomarkers of zinc status.
HarvestPlus is now developing two key staples for the Indian       sub-continent, rice and wheat, biofortified with optimal levels of zinc       (final report, corroborating source E).
