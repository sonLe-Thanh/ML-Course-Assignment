     Patients benefit from improved clinical outcomes and improved quality         of life       Several studies (cited in [a]), including a five-year randomised control       trial comparing the outcomes       of 541 patients across 32 investigational sites and showing improved       outcomes for those patients       who had received a PRESTIGE disc (276 patients) versus those who had the       ACDF (265 patients)       [b], confirmed the clinical benefit of the artificial joint and       underpinned changes in NICE guidance.
The following outcomes were reported:             Neurological function as evaluated through tests of motor         function, sensory function and         deep tendon reflexes was consistently significantly higher for the ACJ         group.
Neck disability index improved for both patient groups, but         those that had received the ACJ         consistently had lower scores (i.e., less pain and disability) than         those that had ACDF.
At         both three and five years after the operation, the differences between         these two treatment         groups were significant.
Neck pain after the operation was consistently less among those         that had received the ACJ         (though the differences between groups were not significant after five         years).
Mean angular motion in the spine at the site of operation was         maintained in the ACJ group         five years after the operation, whereas it was greatly restricted in the         ACDF group, as         expected.
Reduced number of secondary surgeries and interventions at the           original site of operation         among those that had received the ACJ.
There were 11 secondary surgeries         associated         with the ACJ group and 32 associated with the ACDF group.
For people living with debilitating neck pain, replacement of the       cervical disc with an ACJ is a       viable treatment option that will not compromise future mobility.
One       patient reported that after       having the PRESTIGE disc surgery, "the neck pain [she] had come to think       of as normal was gone.
[She] went back to work within a week and did a 25-mile bike ride within       two weeks" [c, pg 16].
Changes to National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence         (NICE) guidance       The most recent (May 2010) guidance from NICE is that "current evidence on       the efficacy of       prosthetic intervertebral disc replacement in the cervical spine shows       that this procedure is as least       as efficacious as fusion in the short term and may result in a reduced       need for revision surgery in       the long term" [a].
This represents a shift from the NICE guidance issued       in November 2004, which       stated that there was sufficient evidence regarding the safety and       efficacy of the prosthetic       intervertebral disc replacement procedure to support its use, but that       "there is little evidence on       outcomes beyond 2-3 years" [d].
Economic benefits to society associated with ACJ       There are substantial cumulative long-term healthcare savings associated       with the use of an ACJ       rather than ACDF.
Though in-patient cervical arthroplasty is initially       more costly, there is a reduced       need for subsequent surgeries, resulting in a mean net benefit of $431 per       patient [e].
When       considering only outpatient single-level procedures, ACJ is 62% less       costly than ACDF [f].
Patients       who received an ACJ also had fewer days off work post-surgery (a mean of       38 work days) than       patients who had fusion surgery [e].
Based on the occupations and wages of       the study group       participants, this resulted in a mean societal benefit of $6,547 (2007       figures) per patient over two       years post-surgery due to reduced wage loss [e].
The long-term reduction       in healthcare costs       associated with cervical arthroplasty will have an ongoing positive       economic impact on society.
Medtronic benefits from the commercialisation of the ACJ developed in         Bristol       Medtronic is the world's largest medical technology company, reaching more       than 120 countries.
The ACJ developed by Medtronic in 1998, known as PRESTIGE I, used Gill's       design that improved       upon Cummins' original device to allow translational and rotational motion       [Gause, Gill et al.
(2006).
United States patent No.
6,113,637, cites 1].
Medtronic       subsequently invested in several       more adaptations of the PRESTIGE ACJ and the final version, developed in       2002, was approved       by the FDA in July 2007 [g].
This enabled Medtronic to launch the PRESTIGE       &#174; Cervical Disc       System in the US in the first quarter of 2008.
The unit sold for $4,450       USD (2010 pricing) [h].
Since       its launch, 31,000 Prestige units have been sold in 60 countries (personal       communication, Marc       Dace, Director of Product Development at Medtronic Spine &amp; Biologics).
This amounts to more       than $137million in sales for Medtronic since 2008.
Medtronic's net sales       of core spinal devices,       including the PRESTIGE, in the 2008 fiscal year were $1.869 billion USD &#8212;       an increase of 9% over       the prior fiscal year [i].
Medtronic attributed this increase to       "continued acceptance of our products       for the thoracolumbar and cervical sections of the spine" [i, pg 24].
Looking ahead in its 2008       annual report, Medtronic singled out the "continued growth and acceptance       of our PRESTIGE &#174;       Cervical Disc System" as an area of growth for future sales [i, pg 25].
The trend for increased growth in Medtronic's core spinal sales has       continued since 2008 [i-k].
In       2012, sales were $2.467 billion USD [k], an increase of 32% from 2008,       with much of the growth       occurring in international markets [k].
Spinal restorative therapies       constituted 20% of Medtronic's       annual revenue of $16 billion in 2012 [k].
