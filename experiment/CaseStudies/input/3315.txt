     The impacts are of a cultural, societal and educational nature and have       been, in relation to particle physics: to raise awareness; to respond to       the very high level of interest demonstrated by the public; to inform and       stimulate debate on research and its value; to motivate individuals and       students in particular to learn more and possibly pursue a career based on       the sciences.
The beneficiaries have been A-level students and their       teachers; young professionals in the London area; the general public       interested in science.
These impacts have been achieved, with the       engagement of all members of the CPP, by the targeted development of       hands-on demonstrations, and by our participation in, and organisation of,       a series of co-ordinated outreach events (Particle Physics masterclasses,       science lectures and open days for the general public, the Royal Society       exhibit on the Higgs boson in 2013).
More detail on these activities is       provided below.
Development of hands-on particle physics demonstrations &amp;         activities: Members of the CPP have developed several custom-made       hands-on demonstrations designed to engage a wider public with our       research on (i) particle accelerators, (ii) dark matter and (iii) the       search for the Higgs particle.
These demonstrations have been used in       2013, all before the end of July.
They are:            a 3 m-long table-top demonstrator ("Accelerate!")
of the principle         behind linear charged particle accelerators.
This was developed by Dr         Stephen Gibson, who joined the John Adams Institute for Accelerator         Science at Royal Holloway in January 2013, and has been used in the         Royal Holloway Particle Physics masterclasses, the Royal Holloway         Science Open Day (in excess of 650 visitors to the Department of         Physics, mostly families with children), and a Physics Taster Day for         A-level students, held at Royal Holloway and attended by 50 prospective         undergraduates.
a demonstration of how galaxy-rotation curves provide evidence for the         existence of dark matter in the Universe, based on a 1-m diameter         rotating "drum".
This demonstration was created by Nikkel and has been         used at Royal Holloway in 2013, for the Particle Physics masterclasses         and the Physics Taster Day.
a custom-made histogram made out of wood, and some loaded dice, to         explain how evidence of the existence of the Higgs was obtained in the         LHC data, and to demonstrate the statistical aspects behind the         discovery of a signal in the presence of background (a computer-based         version of this demonstration was also developed, to be used in         tablets); a "Higgs hunt" activity aimed at younger children, aged 4-12,         complete with a "Wanted poster" including other age-appropriate         activities; and a set of specially-labelled polyhedral 12-sided dice to         illustrate the probabilistic nature of the decay of the Higgs particle.
All of these activities were used extensively to engage the public         during the Royal Society exhibition described below.
Particle Physics masterclasses: an annual one-day event for lower       sixth form students and their teachers, which we run twice a year, in       March or April.
Every year, all available members of the group (PhD       students, PDRAs and academics) are involved in the running of this event.
The programme includes two talks, on the structure of matter, and on the       Large Hadron Collider and the search for the Higgs particle.
In addition,       there are three hands-on activities for the students to complete.
Teachers       and academics are encouraged to talk with each other during the day; the       teachers use this opportunity to ask about particle physics and, in       particular, topics which form part of the A-level curriculum that they       have to deliver.
This increases their confidence and familiarity with the       material.
The masterclasses are always oversubscribed.
We receive 75-80       students and 9-10 teachers for every masterclass, making in excess of 900       students impacted in the REF period.
In total 110 school groups have       attended a masterclass in this period, from 71 different schools.
The       masterclasses are integrated in the National Particle Physics Masterclass       programme.
The Royal Holloway Centre for Particle Physics was one of the       first UK groups to organise these masterclasses, and have done so every       year since 1999.
In student feedback collected in 2013 (39 questionnaires)       50% of the students responded that attending the masterclass had helped       them feel more confident about their ability to enter Higher Education.
Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition 2013: The ATLAS and       Theoretical Particle Physics groups at Royal Holloway contributed to the       organisation and the running of the "Understanding the Higgs boson"       exhibit that was open to the general public in the Royal Society, in       London, July 2-7 2013.
(One additional day, July 1, was dedicated to       visits from schools.)
The exhibit had contributions from 18 university       groups in the UK, and was co-ordinated by a colleague from the University       of Birmingham.
The Royal Holloway group was one of the main contributors       to the exhibit: in particular, Teixeira-Dias and Boisvert developed       several of the hands-on activities (described above) which were used [1].
In addition, Teixeira-Dias and Cowan contributed eight written pages with       personal accounts of their involvement in the Higgs search, included in       the free 110-page booklet [2] that accompanied the exhibit (2000 copies of       which were given to visitors at the exhibition), and 8 Royal Holloway       staff did 9 shifts of 4 hours each, interacting with the public at the       exhibition.
The Royal Society exhibition had more than 12,500 visitors       overall [3], with at least 7,000 estimated to have visited the Higgs       exhibit (based on actual peak-time and out-of-peak time visitor counts).
The Royal Society staff estimated that the Higgs exhibit was one of the       most sought-after exhibits (based on direct observation of how busy the       exhibit was throughout the week, and the observation that often visitors       arriving at the exhibition would ask reception specifically for directions       to the Higgs exhibit).
A total of 307 questionnaires were returned by       visitors to the Higgs exhibit, with 47% of respondents in the 12-18 years       age group (22% in 19-29 y; 24% in 30-65 y).
64% of respondents found the       exhibit "very informative" (with a further 30% selecting "quite       informative"), and 81% left the exhibit with an increased interest in       physics [4].
The website of the exhibition overall (http://sse.royalsociety.org/2013/;       including a link to the Higgs exhibit web page) had in excess of 110,000       visits from 83,000 Absolute Unique Visitors [3].
Particle Physics outreach lectures and media engagement: Members       of the Centre for Particle Physics regularly give talks on their research       to audiences outside HEIs and academia, and have engaged with the media.
The audiences impacted have ranged from professionals with a physics or       engineering degree, GCSE and A-level students and their teachers, young       professionals, and the general public.
Topics covered include the LHC and       the search for the Higgs and other new particles, the search for Dark       Matter, anti-matter, overviews of Particle Physics, etc.

Our contributions to the following are also worthy of note:            In August 2012, following on from the announcement of the Higgs         discovery at CERN, Boisvert gave a lecture on "Finding the Higgs", as         part of "The Lost Lectures" series that is very popular with young         professionals based in and around London.
The event &#8212; sold out &#8212; had a         paying audience of 500 on the night.
Boisvert's talk (one of six)         inspired and enthused the audience, was described by the founder of The         Lost Lectures series as an "exceptional talk" [5], "without doubt one of         [the] most popular and most appreciated speakers ever!
(...) making         difficult research interesting, entertaining and accessible to the wider         public" [6].
It also generated very positive comment on Twitter [5] and         Facebook [7].
The video of the presentation, freely available online,         has been viewed in excess of 2000 times since [8].
Members of the Particle Physics group have been assiduous contributors         to the "Science For Society &#8212; Particle Physics" one-week residential         course to inform and stimulate A-level Physics teachers.
This is an         annual event organised at Brunel University and funded by The         Goldsmiths' Company (Charity &amp; Education).
Every year since 2002         (2010 excepted) Cowan has contributed a talk on anti-matter:         "Discovering the particles of Nature: the picture that was not         reversed".
Since 2008 the group has contributed one additional talk         every year, on either "ATLAS and the search for New Physics" (Berry) or         "A tunnel to the beginning of time: the LHC and ATLAS" (Boisvert).
Typically, 25 teachers attend every year; since 2008 an estimated 150         teachers have benefitted from the pedagogical talks given by our         academics [9].
Cowan's contribution to the BBC4 "Beautiful Equations" one-hour         documentary [10] written and presented by artist and writer Matt         Collings.
The programme addressed the question as to whether, like art,         equations in physics can also be beautiful.
The program includes a five         minute segment filmed at Royal Holloway, with a demonstration of the         existence of anti-matter using a cloud chamber, in the context of the         discussion of the Dirac equation (one of five equations covered in the         program).
The program was originally broadcast on December 14, 2010 and         the official viewing figures show it was watched by an audience of         336,000 and was in the top 5 most-watched BBC4 programs that week [11].
There were also 5 repeat broadcasts, in 2010, 2011 and 2012.
