     Despite the comparatively small size of Jain religious communities,       numbering approximately four       million in India, 150,000 in the US and 30,000 in the UK, it has been       possible for the Centre of       Jaina Studies to make substantial impacts on these minority religious       communities in a short space       of time: the important annual lectures and workshops began in 1999 and the       Centre's founding in       2004.
Throughout the period 2008-13, the Centre, under Fl&#252;gel's       Chairmanship, has provided       simultaneously a platform for the dissemination of excellent new research       and a welcoming space       for lay Jains and monastics, many of whom regularly travel from India and       the United States to       attend the Centre's academic events featuring papers and presentations by       Fl&#252;gel and others       working in the field of Jaina Studies and cognate disciplines.
In addition, the Centre's events, which are organised around key themes       such as Jaina art, yoga       and approaches to ecological conservation and animal rights, attract wider       audiences of non-       sectarian cultural, advocacy and other organisations as well as interested       members of the general       public.
In recent years, members of Jain communities as well as       non-academics drawn from a       range of organisations have consistently outnumbered academic audience       members, comprising       60-75% of the total of those present.
The following details the Centre's impacts beyond academe specifically in       respect of enhancing       Jain community education and cohesion, and by drawing research on Jainism       into interdisciplinary       events that attract the participation of varied constituencies.
Amongst those from outside academia regularly attending Centre events are       teachers and       students of Jainism and representatives of community organisations and       educational initiatives.
Manish Mehta of the Federation of Jain Associations in North America has       been attending the       annual events since 2004, and has videotaped the presentations of research       for dissemination to       teachers of Jainism in the United States, of whom there are an estimated       600: "I have often cited         from Peter's research, as well as disseminated highlights of past Jaina         Studies Workshops across         the North American Jain communities and Jain teachers."
(1, below)     Teachers of Jainism in the UK have also profited from the Centre's       events.
Shruti Malde, an       ophthalmologist and teacher of weekly classes of Jainism in London to       students between the ages       of 13 and 16 has attended no fewer than eight annual lectures, sometimes       in the company of her       more mature students.
(2)     Fl&#252;gel has also provided advice to the Jain eLibrary, an electronic       resource providing free access       to more than 12,000 books, articles and audio files featuring material on       Jainism to more than       24,000 registered users globally (3).
Fl&#252;gel suggested additional key       holdings for the Library and       provided details as to the locations in India where important texts could       be found.
Aspects of the broader support for the community has been highlighted by       Atul Shah, of Diverse       Ethics, a company providing advice and training on diversity and ethics in       the workplace (4):     "Dr Fl&#252;gel's work has been a huge asset for the community in retaining         its culture and influencing         young people to take an interest and pride in this heritage.
It has         helped us to keep alive the spirit         of reason and to open our eyes to the vast ocean that is Jain philosophy         and culture."
The presentations and discussions of new research are particularly       beneficial to community       members according to Shah as the Centre's events "open [community       members'] eyes to the       science of Jainism and to see outside narrow sectarian boundaries to the       vastness of the       philosophy, the literature, history and the arts and culture."
Annual events in recent years in particular have been characterised by       their interdisciplinary and       often interfaith coverage of a range of topics including Jaina Art and       Architecture and Jaina       approaches to biodiversity and the welfare of animals and plants.
This       latter event, for example,       attracted the participation of environmental and animal rights activists       from the UK, India and       beyond including representatives of The Bhumi Project, a worldwide Hindu       environmental group       and the UK's Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society.
Richard Ryder, the       well-known animal       rights activist and trustee of the RSPCA, wrote in August 2012:     "The Conference had a significant impact on me, helping me to build         relationships, learn about Jain         and other approaches to the subject (...).
I have since spread the news         of this Conference to fellow         members of the large animal welfare community internationally.
It was         good to meet speakers from         other religions as well as from secular backgrounds.
I think the         Conference thus had a unifying         effect.
We felt drawn together by our common interest in animal life and         its wellbeing."
