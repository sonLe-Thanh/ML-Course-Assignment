     Empirical research by UCL Laws has influenced fair and meritorious       selection of judges and judicial professionalism, both of which are       critical ambitions for legal systems.
Our research has been used by the       judiciary, judicial nominating bodies, policy advisory bodies, judicial       training bodies, Ministry of Justice, UK Parliament, European Commission       and International Criminal Court.
Although much research on the judiciary       is inherently highly confidential, the impact of our research has been       publicly acknowledged by these bodies, as summarised below.
Informing selection and supporting increased judicial diversity:       In England and Wales, the new judicial appointments system introduced in       2006 raised expectations of greater diversity in appointments, but       progress has been slow.
By pinpointing barriers to diversity, research       commissioned from UCL Laws has had the following impacts:            Genn's senior practitioners' study [a] resulted in better-informed         outreach work by the Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC) and senior         judiciary.
It identified messages that needed to be communicated to         under-represented groups such as women, minorities and solicitors.
The         study's finding that the requirement to go on circuit and lack of         flexible working was for some highly qualified practitioners an absolute         block on application to the High Court, has led to greater emphasis on         allowing flexibility regarding circuit requirements and contributed to         the introduction of legislative provision for flexible working for the         High Court introduced in April 2013 [13].
Judicial Statistics show a         significant increase in women appointed to the High Court from 10 in         2008 (9%) to 18 in 2013 (17%) [5].
Thomas's recommendation for improved diversity data collection was         implemented by the JAC and Ministry of Justice in 2010, supporting the         evaluation of changes in JAC practice and enabling more reliable         assessment of progress toward diversity (Recommendation 8 in [1]);       Thomas's research findings on diversity influenced the recommendations         of the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution's 2011         investigation into Judicial Appointments [3], including shortlists (at         36), merit (at 70, 73, 95), and membership of the JAC and selection         committees (at 155) to improve selection processes and produce more         diverse appointments;       In 2011, UCLJI created a Judicial Skills CPD course for lawyers         considering applying for judicial appointment [12].
The Judicial         Diversity Taskforce relied on this in its 2011 Progress Report [14, p.         26, 28] and 2012 Progress Report [2, p. 24, 25] as the main evidence         that Recommendation 14 [1, para.
71] and Recommendation16 [1, para.
81]         of the Neuberger Panel had been fulfilled.
At the international court level, our research has also influenced       judicial selection procedures:            Findings and principles from the CICT study were used by the Advisory         Committee on Nominations of Judges of the International Criminal Court         in 2011 in drawing up its operating procedures [4] and in 2013 in         reviewing the processes used by different member states for screening         potential appointees prior to selection [15].
Influencing judicial education and training in the UK and Europe:       Genn's judicial training needs research with the judiciary of England       &amp; Wales [c] and Scotland [f] and Thomas's research on practices in 12       other jurisdictions [e] led to wide-ranging changes in the design and       delivery of judicial training [6, p. 7], including:            In 2008 the JSB implemented a new training strategy based on Genn's         judicial training needs research [7, p. 8] ensuring training is better         adapted to the development needs of the judiciary.
Responses to Genn's         recommendations include more use of participative learning, modular         options in continuation training, and a new cross-jurisdictional course         The Craft of Judging, introduced in 2010 [7, p. 8] and reviewed         favourably in the press in 2012 [11].
Since 2008, the framework of         judicial abilities and qualities (JAQ), which Genn drafted from her         research findings, has been used as the basis for the development of all         judicial training in England and Wales [8, p. 3] and has been adopted         abroad [8].
Genn's judicial training needs research and recommendations for change in       Scotland [f] were accepted and implemented [9, p. i, iii] and led to the:            Development of a new training programme [9, p. 2] and the         establishment of the Judicial Institute for Scotland (JIS) in 2012         costing over &#163;900,000, which has transformed the approach and facilities         for judicial education.
In 2013 the JIS commissioned the UCLJI to review         and evaluate the quality of the training introduced in response to the         2008 report (to be completed by 2015) [16].
Thomas's review of judicial diversity strategies in other jurisdictions:            Highlighted the need for greater exposure of lawyers to the work of         judges before applying for appointment and led to the Neuberger Panel         recommendations that judicial skills training be offered to lawyers         interested in applying for a judicial post [1, para.
71, 81] and the         establishment of the UCLJI CPD course Understanding Judging [2,         12].
Thomas's review of judicial education and training in 12 jurisdictions:            Contributed to the framework and deliverables for all four         Workpackages in the European Commission "Menu for Justice" Project.
From         2009-13 this Project assessed the key gaps in legal and judicial         education and produced a database of national reports for all         twenty-seven European member states [10].
