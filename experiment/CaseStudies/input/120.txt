     The interest generated by this project has resulted directly in two major       exhibitions receiving 200,000 visitors.
Including such things as travel,       food, accommodation and direct expenditure on purchases relating to the       exhibitions, website development, and the spin-off exhibitions it       prompted, the economic activity generated by the project will be in the       order of &#163;5 million, especially if the generation of museum gallery       installations, sales of related publications and merchandise, newly       commissioned art works, and spin-off exhibitions are included.
(3,008       copies of The Power of Dogu have been sold by the British Museum and 1,164       copies of Unearthed by Oxbow Books.)
Once the funding was secured from AHRC, we were able to attract       additional funding from a number of other sources (including: the       International Jomon Culture Conference who funded two Handa Archaeology       Fellows for young Japanese archaeologists: Dr Akira Matsuda, who       specialised in public archaeology and is now a lecturer at UEA, and       Fumihito Nagase, who went on to secure further funding to undertake       fieldwork in the Balkans.
Archaeologists from the Balkans (Slovenia,       Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania) were encountering the Japanese archaeology       and Jomon figurines for the first time.
ERASMUS funded a Polish Intern,       Magdalena Hamera, who specialised in fashion and was interested in what       the figurines could tell us through the representation of clothing and       coiffure.
With the involvement of the British Museum we were able to secure the       cooperation of the Japanese Government Agency for Cultural Affairs (which       has responsibility for archaeology) and the Tokyo National Museum, which       was also a major lender and hosted a `homecoming' exhibition in January       2010.
The British Museum exhibition featured contemporary Japanese art in the       form of manga, and The Power of Dogu exhibition also gave rise to       a special exhibition featuring the work of the manga artist Yukinobu       Hoshino in the Asahi Room (Room 3), which attracted over 90,000 visitors.
It was organised by Professor Nicole Coolidge Rousmaniere, who had       consultative oversight of the project as a whole.
Hoshino spent a week in       London during the exhibition, resulting in Professor Munakata's         British Museum Adventure (first serialised in Japan in Big         Comics for Men published by Shogakkan, circulation c.10 million, and       then published (and subsequently reprinted by the British Museum Press,       Yukinobu Hoshino, Professor Munakata's British Museum Adventure.
London, British Museum Press (2010).
The SCVA exhibition also included       contemporary art and art specially commissioned for the exhibition.
Both       exhibitions had public conferences and a series of over 20 public       `figurine making workshops', run by Dr Andrew Cochrane, and attended by a       wide-range of family groups, teachers and indeed potters.
Associated with       the SCVA exhibition there was a concurrent show of contemporary art       inspired by prehistoric figurines at Gallery 18/21 in the centre or       Norwich, and the `Jomon artist' Ifurai presented his own work during a       weeklong photomontage at `Fusion', a large scale display in the Norwich       Millennium Library.
The exhibitions featured widely in the media (Metro,       Herald and Tribune, Sunday Telegraph, Japan Times, Balkan newspapers,       Radio Norfolk).
The project helped raise awareness of other Japanese       archaeological materials in the British Museum, in particular a collection       of later materials from the kofun period (the Gowland Collection), which       was subject to a special documentary by the main Japanese broadcaster,       NHK, which involved Simon Kaner, Nicole Rousmaniere and other members of       the `dogu team', seen by 10.2 million people in Japan when aired in July       2012.
Other impacts            There are now enhanced materials on the websites of both the British         Museum and the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts which enhance access for         public and scholars to these aspects of their collections.
Based on the exhibitions, further exhibitions have been held in Japan         (Tokyo National Museum, Miho Museum, Akita Prefectural Museum).
Drawing on the exhibition a grant has been secured from Hitachi of         Europe to develop an English-language online resource about Japanese         archaeology and heritage for use in schools in UK and around the world.
This is significant as it will for the first time make easily accessible         Japanese cultural heritage (one of the greatest but little known such         traditions anywhere in the world) in a form of use to teachers within         the constraints of their curricula.
A grant has been secured from the Japan Society for the Promotion of         Science to hold a public symposium and academic workshop on future         agendas for University Museums (one of the justifications for the AHRC         grant was to develop connections between the collections at UEA (SCVA)         and the British Museum.
Building on connections established through the exhibitions, linkages         have been created between municipalities in Japan, the Balkans and UK,         which will result in educational and other cultural exchanges.
Materials from the SCVA exhibition were included in exhibitions in         Japan, and one of the featured artists, Sarah Beare, was invited to         Japan to take part in public workshops in Aomori and Osaka, which         further enhanced the impact of the dogu project for audiences in Japan.
