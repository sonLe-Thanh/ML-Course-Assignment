     The research described in section 2 has increased the use of data and       statistics in the       management and monitoring of healthcare in the UK.
Imperial's work has led       to the development of       innovative statistical and computational methods for processing large data       sets derived from       electronic medical records and NHS databases.
Findings and recommendations arising from our research for the Bristol       Inquiry were reflected in       the inquiry outputs, with the importance of routinely collected hospital       data highlighted in Ian       Kennedy's final Bristol Royal Infirmary Inquiry Report in 2001, `The         Report of the Public Inquiry into         children's heart surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary 1984-1995'       [A]:     "From the start of the 1990s a national database existed at the         Department of Health (the         Hospital Episode Statistics database) which among other things held         information about deaths       in hospital.
It was not recognised as a valuable tool for analysing the         performance of hospitals.
It is now, belatedly."
As a direct consequence of our work final recommendations of the Inquiry       included:     "Steps should be taken nationally and locally to build the confidence         of clinicians in the data         recorded in the Patient Administration Systems in trusts (which is         subsequently aggregated         nationally to form the Hospital Episode Statistics).
Such steps should         include the establishment         by trusts of closer working arrangements between clinicians and clinical         coding staff."
"The Hospital Episode Statistics database should be supported as a         major national resource         which can be used reliably, with care, to undertake the monitoring of a         range of healthcare         outcomes."
[A]     The Commission for Healthcare Improvement (CHI, now called the Care       Quality Commission or       CQC) took forward the recommendations of the Bristol Inquiry from July       2001, which to this day       uses Hospital Episode Statistics to monitor healthcare performance (for       example, `CQC indicators       for mortality and emergency readmissions using Hospital Episode Statistics       (HES)', May 2013 [B]).
Our contribution to the Shipman Inquiry was recognised in the final       report by Dame Janet Smith [C,       paragraph 14.27]:     "I am most grateful to Dr Aylin and his colleagues for the work that         they have done for the         Inquiry.
It is innovative and, as I had hoped, it has made a real         contribution to the debate about         the feasibility and the value of setting up a system for the routine         monitoring of mortality rates         among the patients of GPs."
A number of recommendations arose as a direct result of this work [C,       Recommendations,       paragraphs 22-44, page 53] :     The Department of Health (DoH) must take the lead in developing a         national system for         monitoring GP patient mortality rates.
The system should be supported by         a well-organised,         consistent and objective means of investigating those cases where a GP's         patient mortality         rates signal as being above the norm.
Every GP practice should keep a death register in which particulars of         the deaths of patients of         the practice should be recorded for use in audit and for other purposes.
PCTs should undertake reviews of the medical records of deceased         patients, either on a routine         periodic basis (if resources permit) or on a targeted basis limited to         those GPs whose         performance gives rise to concern.
The above recommendations are detailed further in Chapter 27, `Proposals       for Change &#8212; The Use       of Mortality Data as a Clinical Governance Tool: A National System of       Monitoring' (27.105-27.107,       [C]), and Chapter 14, `The Monitoring of Mortality Rates among the       Patients of General       Practitioners' [C].
Chapter 14 details the exact contribution of Aylin,       Best, Bottle, Marshall and the       Imperial team to the Inquiry (14.23-14.71, [C]).
Chapter 14 described how       "CUSUM charts could be         used to monitor patient mortality rates at GP level and that they would         have been capable of         detecting Shipman if they had been in use at the relevant time"       (14.65, [C]).
The methodology developed and published in [4] and [5] is the methodology       that now underpins       both (i) our Real Time Monitoring System which is currently used by 70% of       English NHS acute       trusts to assist them in monitoring a variety of casemix adjusted outcomes       at the level of diagnosis       group and procedure group [D], and (ii) the CQC mortality outliers       programme that looks at       patterns of death rates within NHS trusts and is used to generate the       quarterly alerts of trusts with       high mortality [E].
The process involves analysing data that suggests       concerning trends in the       death rate for specific conditions or operations, with the trends being       calculated using SPC charts       [F].
All of the outliers are calculated using patient-level data from       hospitals which become part of a       national HES system.
Some outliers are calculated by Imperial College (Dr       Foster Unit), while       others are calculated by the CQC [F].
Imperial's mortality alerting system has also been pivotal in alerting       the then Healthcare       Commission (HCC) to problems at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust       [G], which has       been the centre of a number of investigations and national inquiries.
Through the HCC's       programme to analyse mortality rates in England, it received an       unprecedented 11 alerts about       high mortality at the trust, four of which were after the investigation       was launched.
Of the seven       alerts that were received prior to the launch of the investigation, four       came from the Dr Foster       Research Unit at Imperial College as part of its analysis of data [G,       Appendix E].
