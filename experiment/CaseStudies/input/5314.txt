     Graham's academic research undertaken at Imperial in 2001 provided an       initial general approach for measuring the effects of accessibility on       productivity.
In 2005 the UK DfT commissioned him to develop this work to       devise a specific approach to WEI estimation that would produce empirical       results compatible with existing methods of appraisal [1,3,5].
Between       2005 and 2008 the DfT disseminated the results of the Imperial research in       a series of high-profile conferences, seminars and workshops aimed at       informing civil servants and professional analysts about these new       techniques.
These included the following events            `Wider Benefits of Transport Investment' given to the Office of the         Deputy Prime Minister / Department for Transport seminar (November 2005)       `Agglomeration and Transport' given to HM Treasury (Eddington Group)         (July 2006)       `Transport and agglomeration', OECD Round Table on Macro-, Meso- and         Micro-Infrastructure Planning and Assessment Tools, Boston (October         2007)       `Transport and productivity', DfT Conference on the Eddington Report         and Transport Policy, London (April 2007)       `Transport investment and urban productivity', DfT Eddington         Analytical Seminar, London (May 2007)       `Measuring wider economic benefits of transport', UK Government         Economic Service Annual Meeting, Nottingham (July 2008)       `Cost Benefits Analysis', US Department of Transport Benefit Costs         Analysis Conference, Washington DC (May 2010)          The research was also adopted by the UK Treasury who in 2006 funded       (jointly with DfT) a research annex to their report on `Transport's role       in sustaining the UK's productivity and competitiveness' (The Eddington       Report) [2].
The Eddington Report included detailed applications of the       WEI approach to appraisal and argued that it provided a superior tool for       decisions support than conventional CBA.
The significance of the research on WEIs is that it has led to an       important reform of CBA for project appraisal of transport schemes, and       consequently has influenced investment planning at national and local       levels [A-E].
Following publication of this work the DfT subsequently       undertook a major revision of their CBA methodology (2007-2009) based on       Imperial's approach for the assessment of WEIs and in 2009 formally       incorporated Graham's estimates in the DfT web based CBA guidance (WebTAG)       (see http://www.dft.gov.uk/webtag/documents/expert/pdf/U3_5_14-wider-impacts120723.pdf)       [A,B,C].
Interest in WEIs spread rapidly and has been taken up by national       Governments and public authorities throughout the world as a decision       support tool.
It is now used routinely by the transport modelling       profession as the standard approach for WEI assessment.
Within the UK, high-profile examples of the direct application of the       Imperial approach (with economic value indicated) include CrossRail (2010)       (&#163;16bn) [F], High Speed 2 (2010, 2012) (&#163;50bn) [G], Manchester Rail Hub       (2009) (&#163;530m), and the Leeds city-region transport strategy (2009-2012)       (&#163;4bn).
Indications are that it will be used to assess the case for       CrossRail 2.
Following formal adoption of the WEI approach in the UK interest spread       throughout the world.
Initial international applications took place in       Australia (2011) [J], New Zealand (2010, 2011) [H, I], and the USA (2009).
We have been active in leading the spread of our approach worldwide.
The       table below summarises the projects in which Imperial or its industrial       partners have been directly involved since 2009 and shows that almost 150       billion US Dollars of international investment has been appraised using       the Imperial approach.

Furthermore,       recent desktop research of impacts finds much more extensive use of       concepts and calculations derived from the research.
The fundamental       contribution of the work lies in developing an empirical approach to       capture the productivity effects of changes in the transport network.
This       is done by estimating a set of parameters that will typically differ by       country, and possibly by regions of countries, and there is therefore a       very large scale of on-going work to roll the approach out in different       countries.
The benefits of the research accrue to many different groups in society.
It offers Governments improved information upon which to make decisions       about transport investments, and in so doing, can support improvements in       economic growth and productivity for regions and nations.
It provides the       transport profession with more robust ways of modelling the impacts of       investment on the economy, and it advances the scope and influence of the       transport modelling discipline.
It allows interest groups and societal       organisation access to more reliable information about the impacts of       infrastructure proposals that affect them.
Finally, it aids the       coordination and planning of major infrastructure projects and helps in       prioritising transport spending to achieve better outcomes for society in       terms of value for money, economic growth and productivity.
