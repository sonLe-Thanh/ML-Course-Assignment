     The MCW Foresight programme findings have raised awareness through their       contribution to critical debate on mental capital and wellbeing.
Specifically, they have had impact on government policy, business,       academic and charity work and attracted international interest to develop       similar programmes.
They were reported to the senior management teams of       relevant UK government departments, including the Departments of Health,       Work and Pensions and Education).
Cooper and the government's Chief       Scientific Advisor presented the findings to the Permanent Secretaries on       10th December 2008.
The Chief Scientific Advisor confirms the `considerable         impact on policy development, research and the strategic thinking of         many of the project's stakeholders in government and elsewhere',       saying that the Government Office for Science is `particularly         grateful to Professor Cooper for his continued active support for the         report and in championing the study with key organisations and fora with         an interest in this area.'
This included presentations to       professional institutions such as the Chartered Institute of Professional       Development (CIPD) and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
`The         MCW One Year Review' (2009) details the dissemination of the       findings between October 2008 and November 2009 and includes statements       from national and international organisations who have adapted their       policies and strategic thinking following the programme.
