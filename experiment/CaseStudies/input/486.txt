     The International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) was the first of its       kind to compare neurosurgical clipping and endovascular coiling for       patients suffering from subarachnoid haemorrhage.
It showed endovascular       coiling to be the superior treatment for cerebral aneurysms, leading to       significant changes in clinical guidelines for the management of       aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, and major changes in practice around       the world.
Clinical Guidelines:       In 2012 the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association       issued guidelines for the management of aneurysmal subarachnoid       haemorrhage, recommending endovascular coiling for patients with ruptured       aneurysms6.
The guidelines, which cite ISAT as their primary       source of data, support the use of coiling as the preferred treatment for       patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, and also emphasise the       importance of follow-up imaging for patients who have received both       coiling and clipping treatments due to the small risk of re-bleeding,       which was demonstrated in the trial6.
Current National       Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines support the       use of coil embolisation of ruptured intracranial aneurysms due to the       safety and efficacy of the procedure in comparison to surgical clipping.
They also stated that due to the small risk of re-bleeding, patients       should receive long-term monitoring following both procedures7.
In addition, the NICE Interventional Procedures Consultation Document for       Embolisation of Intracranial Aneurysms states that the endovascular       coiling procedure is superior to surgical clipping in the short term8.
In 2009 the American Association of Neuroscience Nurses Clinical Practice       Guidelines for the Care of Patients with Aneurysmal Subarachnoid       Haemorrhage recommended endovascular coiling as the preferred method of       aneurysm treatment in cases where both surgical clipping and endovascular       coiling are potential options9.
Practice Patterns:       A 2003 Position Statement from the Executive Committee of the American       Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology and the American       Society of Neuroradiology concluded: "the ISAT study was a         well-designed and well-executed, randomized, controlled trial on a large         number of patients.
These data provide the highest level of evidence         supporting the use of detachable coils for patients with ruptured         cerebral aneurysms suitable for endovascular therapy"10.
The 2009 Stroke Association haemorrhagic stroke factsheet recommends       coiling as the preferred treatment option for subarachnoid haemorrhage,       because 77% of patients make a good or full recovery, in comparison to 70%       following surgical clipping11.
In the UK, endovascular coiling       is increasingly the treatment of choice12 and this is       associated with a beneficial effect on survival.
The NHS now claims that       65% of people survive aneurysms in comparison to the 50% mortality rate       cited in Jan van Gijn's 2007 Lancet paper on subarachnoid haemorrhage2.
Such an improved outlook is partly down to better treatment, and party due       to more urgent admissions.
Patients undergoing neurosurgery have to wait       for up to a week to be stabilised for treatment, whereas coiling can be       administered immediately.
In a 2011 review13 analysing the impact of ISAT on clinical       practice in the United States, it was concluded that as a result of the       trial there were significant pattern changes in the treatment of ruptured       aneurysms in the US, with far more patients undergoing the endovascular       coiling treatment for ruptured aneurysms than clipping.
Changes in       clinical guidelines following the publication of ISAT also led to a 3%       decrease in mortality for those suffering from ruptured aneurysms13       in the period up to 2011.
The report concluded: "The results of the         ISAT have been associated with a prominent change in practice patterns         related to the treatment of ruptured aneurysms.
The review also       claimed: "The cost of hospitalization has increased and the mortality         has decreased, presumably due to a larger proportion of patients         receiving any treatment and endovascular (coil) treatment"13.
