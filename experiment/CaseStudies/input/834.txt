     Context     In the UK, electricity generation through biomass co-firing began in 2002       and grew to approximately 28 MWe by 2005 (DTI, 2005).
More recently there       have been several strategic investments by the UK's power generation       industry to replace coal with biomass, driven by legally- binding domestic       targets in CO2 reduction and government incentives so that in       2011 co-firing was delivering over 525 MWe; this is projected to more than       double by 2020 and the same is true in Europe as a whole (National       Renewable Energy Plans).
Conversions to biomass will result in       approximately 70% reduction in GHG emissions compared to coal.
And       increasing incentives could "employ up to 18,000 jobs in the UK by 2020         in the biomass electricity sector alone" (Bioeconomy Consultants       NNFCC, 2012).
The move to biomass has required changes in policy and practice at nearly       every stage in the energy cycle, from fuel procurement and logistics to       handling (including milling), burner design, and firing and emission       control strategies.
Research from the University of Leeds underpins a       number of technical challenges the industry has overcome and has also       informed policy, in particular the development of energy roadmaps, these       impacts occurring during the eligible period as a result of dissemination       and direct beneficiary engagement via collaborative R&amp;D, consultancy,       CPD and expert advisory roles and capacity building.
Impact on Industry Practice     Technical innovations in the fields of biomass combustion, boiler       efficiency, plant operation and emission have benefited the UK's two       largest electricity generators Drax Power and Eggborough Power, who       between them generate 11% of the country's electricity.
A combination of biomass combustion collaborative research [A]       (EP/H048839/1, Jones, 2010- 2014) and consultancy between 2010 and July       2013 has "been extremely valuable" to Drax Power Ltd [B].
Impacts include:     - Widening the fuel portfolio so that Drax is able to use larger volumes       of lower grade fuel (i.e.
from agricultural and forestry) sources; "providing         significant savings on fuel costs of up to &#163;15m per annum".
[B]     - Allowing "full sustainability to be achieved, opening up new markets         to the industry and better managing the world's resources on a global         scale" by completing a "superb analysis of options in the supply         chain".
[B] "The outcomes of the KTP project with Drax have         directly contributed to the overall strategy of Drax Group PLC by         supporting the establishment of new supplies of biomass that when burned         will ultimately reduce its CO2 emissions from         power generation by burning more biomass and will diversify the business         away from the current almost total reliance on fossil fuel supplies for         power generation".
Improved market research capability through the       KTP has resulted in an estimated reduction in biomass cost of &#163;2m p.a.
[A].
- Solving engineering issues allowing the use of biomass; "slagging         and fouling to be managed and corrosion to be reduced to the four yearly         outages normally only seen with coal."
[B]     Drax Power, which invested &#163;50 million in 2009 to allow co-firing of up       to 12.5% biomass and CO2 reductions of up to 1.8 million       tonne/p.a., plans conversion of half of their units to biomass over the       next three years.
Despite recent changes to government policy on biomass       subsidies, Drax remains committed to this expansion the CEO describing it       is a "sound investment strategy" [C].
Eggborough Power Ltd announced plans in November 2012 to fully       convert to biomass, an investment of "hundreds of millions of pounds"       [D].
Consultancy for Eggborough in the field of biomass combustion between       February and July 2013, particularly NOx formation, have been "fundamental         to the success of the project" [E].
Researchers from Leeds undertook collaborative research [F] with Energy         Environmental Ltd (EEL) in the field of torrefied biomass handling       and combustion (June 2012 to March 2013).
EEL, the holding company for a       portfolio of companies concerned with viable new environmental       technologies, benefited from being able to seamlessly integrate torrefied       biomass into the coal feed prior to milling.
Commercial scale milling and       combustion data showed that torrefied biomass "offers a low cost         alternative for coal-fired power stations".
[G]     A University of Leeds Continuing Professional Development short course on       biomass combustion that drew on the underpinning research and the       Institution's engagement with industry has helped beneficiaries make fuel       supplies more predictable in terms of performance in the boiler [H].
The       annual course started in 2009 and has been attended by 203 delegates at       all levels of seniority, from new graduates to senior project engineers,       managing directors, and senior policy advisors [H] from 95 different UK       and international beneficiaries (companies/government departments/NGOs).
Policy     Leeds researchers have participated in many workshops and policy       discussions, drawing on the underpinning research in biomass and biofuels       utilisation to provide expert advice that has informed the development of       UK energy:      - All Party Parliamentary Renewable Transport Fuels Group, 2009.
This       comprises 20 politicians from the major political parties and aims to       highlight the potential of renewable transport fuels in reducing carbon       emissions from the transport sector and increase fuel security       (Pourkashanian).
