     Epidemiology and diagnostic criteria tools: Our International       Study of Asthma and Allergies in       Childhood (ISAAC: 1.96 million children, 306 research centres in 105       countries, 53 languages,       &gt;500 publications) has increased global awareness of the importance of       eczema as a significant       childhood disease to policy makers by demonstrating that it is increasing       and common in       developing as well as developed countries.
The work influenced the       formation of a National Child &amp;       Youth Eczema Clinical Network funded by the Ministry of Health and       Paediatric Society of New       Zealand in 2012 [a].
This has provided information and training in patient       education and eczema       management to nurse specialists, general practitioners and paediatricians,       and has developed a       system for monitoring services to inform continuous quality       improvement.The diagnostic criteria for       eczema that we developed for ISAAC and other epidemiological studies were       found to be the best       validated and widely used criteria worldwide in an independent systematic       review in 2008 [b].
They       continue to be the most widely used diagnostic criteria for eczema for       epidemiological studies       [PLoS One.2012;7(7):e39803].
Systematic reviews influencing clinical practice: Our systematic       review of eczema treatments       was the major evidence source for the UK NICE guidance on eczema in       children 2007,       recommendations of which were taken up from 2008 onwards as in the NICE       update in 2011 [c],       SIGN guidance on eczema of all ages in 2011 [d], and international eczema       guidelines for       dermatologists, paediatricians and general practitioners in South Africa,       Europe, New Zealand and       Japan [e].
The Japanese guidance required a full translation into       Japanese.
As a result of another       key finding from our review, picked up by our BMJ change page [Br Med J       2007;334:1272] and       2011 SIGN Guidance [d], it was recommended that doctors prescribe       once-daily topical steroids       rather than more frequent application.
This benefits patients and their       carers by reducing the       treatment palaver for busy parents, and reducing the risk of side-effects       like skin thinning.
It also       benefits the NHS by reducing treatment costs from &#163;3.25million to       &#163;2.44million (2012 prices) [f].
Clinical Trials &#8212; introducing cost-effective treatments and discarding         ineffective ones:       Following on from our pioneering research into nurse-led clinics,       dermatologists in the UK,       Germany and the Netherlands set up similar clinics from 2005 to 2012,       which have been shown to       be cost saving.
NICE Guidance including an analysis of the       cost-effectiveness of nurse-led       educational interventions for eczema in children concluded that it       "appears to be both effective and       good value for money for children with atopic eczema in secondary care"       [c], which has been borne       out by a subsequent analysis of a large trial of nurse education conducted       in the Netherlands in       2010 [Br J Dermatol 2011;165:600-611].
Our topical corticosteroids trial has been cited 111 times and was used       to inform the NICE       guidance updated in 2011 [c].
It was the first trial to evaluate disease       flares in eczema research       and has led to a series of trials of "proactive" (twice weekly) therapy       which has reduced eczema       flares in children and adults by around 50% [g].
Our trial of water softeners provided clear guidance, showing for the       first time that these do not         work for children with eczema.
If our work prevented just 10% of the       estimated 400,000 UK       families with a child with moderate to severe eczema buying a device over       the 3-year period       2011-2013, this would save around &#163;4 million (based on an average cost of       &#163;750 per unit, plus       salt and servicing costs).
Outcomes research: Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) are       recommended by the       Department of Health as critical aspects of measuring clinical care       outcomes.
Our eczema-specific       PROM, called the Patient-Reported Eczema Measure (POEM), one of three       eczema severity       scales that have been appropriately validated and recommended for use, is       recommended as a       tool for capturing treatment response in consultations with eczema       patients by NICE [c] and Map of       Medicine [h].
POEM is being used in clinical practice to assess the       severity of eczema and monitor       treatment outcomes.
Quotes describing its impact include `especially good       as makes assessment       less subjective' and `very useful resources in a busy clinical setting'       [i].
Beneficiaries have included       paediatric dermatology teams at Nottingham, Birmingham, Dewsbury, Oxford,       Gloucester and       London, and US care organizations including the Boston Children's Hospital       and Mayo clinic [i].
Public engagement in research: Our James Lind Alliance research       priority setting partnership       has benefitted NHS funders including the NIHR Efficiency and Mechanism       Evaluation (EME)       Programme who, in 2013, issued a special call on skin diseases       [http://www.nets.nihr.ac.uk/funding/eme-commissioned/briefs/13-50-com-brief.pdf].
The Nottingham Support Group for Carers of Children with Eczema       (http://www.nottinghameczema.org.uk),       which we established in partnership with patients, has       developed twenty two information sources for patients' benefit covering       all aspects of eczema, and       has won several awards.
Our University now hosts this website, the value       and impact of which is       evidenced by numerous quotes from patients, carers and healthcare       professionals [j].
Our       engagement with the public has benefitted outstanding patient volunteers       such as Amanda       Roberts [j] who became part of the NICE 2007 and RCPCH 2011 guidelines       groups.
Amanda runs       a Twitter account on the group's eczema work (@eczemasupport), and has       over 4,200 followers.
