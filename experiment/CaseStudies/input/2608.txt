     Thomson's challenge, in leading the Monet 1840-1926 team, was to       conceptualise, select and mount an exhibition which not only surveyed       Monet's career comprehensively but provocatively challenged widely-held       public preconceptions about both the artist and the character of a museum       retrospective.
Brought into an established team at the Mus&#233;e d'Orsay, he created a       successful partnership with other colleagues at Orsay and the R&#233;union des       Mus&#233;es Nationaux, negotiating key loans and refining the initial selection       made in October-November 2008.
This coming together of experts from both       academia and public museums was a key exercise in knowledge exchange,       leading to more public access to the paintings and their international,       scholarly interpretation (5.8).
Beyond his curatorial work, Thomson became involved in raising       sponsorship for the exhibition, giving a presentation at the H&#244;tel       Matignon to the financial services company, Natixis, on 14th December       2009.
This resulted in sponsorship of &#8364;500k for the exhibition and a piece       by Fran&#231;ois P&#233;rol, Director of Natixis, in the catalogue, commenting on       the company's wish to be associated with the reassessment of the artist       and on the show's 'surprising connections and unprecedented groupings'       (5.6).
Having collaborated with Guy Cogeval on choosing authors for the       exhibition catalogue essays, Thomson wrote the account of the concept of       the show in the catalogue, together with six section introductions       (totalling about one third of the publication) and liaised with the       production team.
During the exhibition, 83,000 copies were sold (French,       English and other languages) at &#8364;50 a copy (totalling &#8364;4.1m in sales)       (5.1).
Prior to the exhibition's opening, Thomson and the team worked with the       installation designer and the hanging team, as well as press and       sponsorship staff, to ensure maximum public awareness of, and       accessibility to, the works on display.
At the opening on 22nd September       2010, his contribution to the press launch included radio and television       interviews with France Inter, France Culture, France 5, Radio France       Internationale, BBC News and Reuters TV (20th September 2010).
Running until 24th January 2011, Monet, 1840-1926 was seen by a       total of 913,064 people and was kept open continuously for the last four       days.
Thomson played a key role in delivering the most successful       exhibition ever staged at the Grand Palais (with admissions totalling &#8364;10m       based on a standard entry price of &#8364;12 and &#8364;8 for concessions) (5.1).
To supplement the exhibition, and give more access to contextual material       and research, a programme of lectures and films was held in the Grand       Palais.
Collectively, these received 21,928 visitors, with 5,970 children       attending workshops (5.1).
Calculations of the economic value of the Monet exhibition to Paris have       been made using the formula provided by the Association of Independent       Museums and its figures for London (there is no R&#233;union des Mus&#233;es       Nationaux equivalent): 100,000 visitors (overnight visit) at &#8364;57.13;       200,000 visitors (day visit) at &#8364;42.99; 600,000 visitors (local or       half-day visit) &#8364;21.50; totalling &#8364;27,211,000.
The Balances of Tourism         in Paris/Ile de France 2010 reported that, while tourism to the       capital from western European countries had dropped by two percent since       2009 (due to the economic crisis), 'The success of exhibitions of renowned       international artists such as Claude Monet' helped the situation (5.5).
To promote Monet to a younger demographic, Thomson edited the texts for Monet         Num&#233;rique (Digital Monet), an interactive exhibition website,       supported by the Conseil National de la Cr&#233;ation Artistique (CCA).
This       website, www.monet2010.com,       received two million hits during the four months of the show and remains       an active online resource today.
As expected in the initial conceptualisation, which sought to engage       historic art with contemporary debate, press and blogs across France       responded to the exhibition in terms of national identity, nostalgia and       the pressures of modernity: 'Nostalgia for a France of gardens, peaceful       villages, and the slow pace of life without the car or the aeroplane' (Sud         Radio); 'A luminous reflection of French identity...as it was a       hundred a years ago' (inventerre.canalblog.com); 'The vanished       happiness of a France which today has lost its identity' (M&#233;morial         del'Is&#232;re newspaper).
Indeed, the exhibition was extremely well received in the French and       international press, both for its accessibility &#8212; `it met with a public       success that is the opposite of elitism' (Le Figaro) &#8212; and for its       presentation of both famous and unfamiliar works in an innovative but       legible display.
`The (re) hanging [of these works] is suggestive, and       demonstrates a remarkable work of elucidation and reinterpretation' (Le         Monde) (5.3); {it is a) `marvellously arranged exhibition', (John       Berger, Harper's); 'Will there ever be a better Monet show, or one       that successfully rethinks this successful rethink?
Not in my lifetime' (Sunday         Times) (5.4).
In an interview for the Annual Review of the Mus&#233;e d'Orsay et de       l'Orangerie 2010 (5.2), Guy Cogeval described how 'general astonishment at       seeing well known works rehung, gave the Musee D'Orsay the feeling of       having been given an entirely new life.'
