     The research was specifically commissioned with the intention of       developing and enhancing Human Resources practice in West Mercia       Constabulary (WMC), which at the time was one of the largest forces       geographically, covering 3 counties and employing approximately 4500       people.
A clear reporting strategy was therefore in place from the outset       to disseminate on-going findings from both projects within WMC.
This       culminated in the production of a final joint report for the funders (Source         A) and the delivery of a training workshop in June 2007 to the       Corporate Development Strategy Group consisting of WMC's Director of       Strategy and Organisation and the Head of Training and Development as well       as senior police officers and staff.
Feedback at the time from the Head of       Training and Development noted: `as a result [of this training] we have         been able to introduce innovations which have led directly to         performance gains and national recognition'.
(Source B)     There were a range of impacts on Human Resource practice in West Mercia       Constabulary (articulated by the Head of Training and Development) (Source         C):            WMC's Performance and Development Review process was modified in light         of the research with an increased focus on the career development aspect         of the process.
This was highlighted by a poster `campaign' within WMC         with the tagline: "Putting the `D' back into PDR".
The new process was         quality assured through dip sampling undertaken between 2009 and 2010         which showed that staff felt they had benefitted from the change.
The research informed the policy decision taken by WMC to offer the         National Core Leadership Development Programme not only to a wider range         of police officers but also, innovatively, to other police staff.
This         began in late 2006 but continued through into 2010.
The research informed strategy relating to talent management and         succession planning.
For example, the concept of `knowing whom' fed into         the development of a Mentoring programme which was rolled out in 2009.
The research had a palpable impact on organisational learning within         WMC.
For example, the concept of `knowing how' informed the development         of `Learning the Lessons', an agenda that became part of strategic         meetings within HR and which resulted in 2011 in the introduction of         simple, short electronic learning bites (i-cards) (designed to highlight         key points around a subject ) cascaded down from senior officers to         relevant people via email.
More generally, the research raised awareness of a broader concept of         careers amongst police officers and staff and has led to a cultural         change within WMC which has enhanced opportunities for individuals.
For         example, the work on career anchors enabled individuals and the         organisation to view lateral progression as career development.
The impact of the research, specifically the Career Competencies       Indicator, has extended beyond West Mercia Constabulary clearly       demonstrating both reach and significance.
The Career Competencies       Indicator was exhibited at the Festival of Innovation at Birmingham NEC in       November 2007.
At this event, the owner of Consulting         Tools &#8212; a company specialising in online psychometric tools (Source         D) targeted at consultants (in the areas of coaching, training,       talent management) and Human Resource staff &#8212; approached the Centre for       People at Work to collaborate in bringing the tool to market.
The Career       Competencies Indicator was consequently developed through a University of       Worcester Innovation Grant (see section 2 above).
Market research with       careers experts clearly showed that the tool could be applied in the other       sectors.
A revised version of the Career Competencies Indicator, aimed at       18-24 year olds, was exhibited and promoted at the British Psychological       Society's Division of Occupational Psychology Conference in January 2012.
It was launched in its final         version by Consulting Tools in April 2013.
Plans are in place to       develop another version of the Career Competencies Indicator aimed at       16-18 year olds.
The successful commercialisation of the Career Competencies Indicator has       had immediate commercial benefits for Consulting Tools itself.
It is a       product that extends their portfolio into a new area and expands their       client base.
The product has already found a market within the Higher       Education sector (for example, it is to be trialled at the University of       Leicester) and there is interest from the Further Education sector and       sixth form colleges.
Moving forward, this tool has clear potential to       enhance the career development of individuals within an age group (16-24)       where unemployment as of July 2013 was over 20%.
