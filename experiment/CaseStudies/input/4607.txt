     Impact on clinical guidelines     By establishing the reliability of mammalian cell systems for drug       screening and potential cardiac toxicity, the research conducted by       Professor Hancox and colleagues at the University of Bristol forms a       cornerstone for the validity of mammalian cell line screens for drug       certification by pharmaceutical companies (as well as for basic science       researchers to better understand how hERG gene products work).
Their       research not only showed that mammalian cell lines can be used to identify       cardiac risk but also revealed some unexpected and clinically important       interactions of disparate drugs on cardiac repolarization mechanisms (see       above).
For example, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had warned       about the use of high doses of SSRI antidepressants because of concerns       over its association with prolonged QT intervals.
This prompted the UK's       regulatory body, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency       (MHRA) to amend its dosage guidance so that it no longer recommends high       doses of SSRIs because of cardiac risk.
However, not all SSRIs have the       same risk and in-vitro hERG bioassays can help identify the less dangerous       SSRIs (that is, those with least effect on hERG) to allow continued use       with less risk and avoid unwarranted concerns as to cardiac safety.
[a, b,       c]     Impact on pre-clinical screening     For an integrated assessment of cardiac risk in drug discovery       programmes, both the current European Medicines Agency (EMA) and FDA       guidelines S7B (2005) recommend the use of mammalian cell line (for       example, CHO) hERG screens (hERG expression in CHO in physiological       conditions was pioneered by Professor Hancox and colleagues).
These       guidelines pertained throughout the REF period, and the EMA guidelines       were updated in December 2009 in ICH guideline M3 (R2).
[c] Virtually all       companies now employ screens against hERG for their lead compounds.
Such       tests are also used to help define structure/activity relationships for       lead compounds (these data are commercially sensitive for drug companies       and thus cannot be documented here).
A 2005 survey of 119 pharmaceutical       companies found that 93% employed hERG assays [d] and approximately 71% of       test substances have undesired effects on hERG.
[e] The hERG screens allows       companies to:            Develop new antiarrhythmic agents directed toward selective hERG         channel inhibition.
This can be carried out more efficiently with modern         automated patch clamp screens using stably transfected mammalian cell         lines.
Determine cardiac toxicity due to promoting long QT syndrome of all         other drugs they develop.
(It should be noted that there are real         concerns as to the validity of small animal models for human conditions         which is reduced by using the human cell line approach.)
Achieve early rejection of prototype drugs.
This creates considerable         cost savings by preventing progression to expensive animal and clinical         trials with subsequent rejection due to long QT effects, which represent         about 70% of the estimated development cost of around $800M per drug         entity (see http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/25/2/420.long).
Impact of new screening technology     The utility of using hERG assay screens has also led to new spin-offs and       development of new hERG-based ion channel screens.
Just a few examples of       major pharmaceutical laboratories developing and using hERG-based ion       channel screens are: Abbot Labs,[f] Pfizer,[g] Millipore,[h] AstraZeneca       [i] and Johnson and Johnson.
[j] The utility of this method has also led to       the development of companies that carry out confidential screening of       prototype drugs for the pharmaceutical industry, such as Cytoprotex       (Macclesfield, UK http://www.cyprotex.com/toxicology/cardiotoxicity/hergsafety/),       which recorded revenues of &#163;8.33m in 2012.
The ability to use mammalian cell lines (such as CHO cells as       demonstrated by Professor Hancox) for drug screening is not only       cost-effective but has also led to the development of automated patch       clamp machines as an important new industry.
Some examples are:             Multichannel Systems: http://www.multichannelsystems.com/products/automated-patch-clamp         Fluxion: http://www.fluxionbio.com/         Cytocentrics: http://www.cytocentrics.com/         Molecular Devices: http://www.moleculardevices.com/Products/Instruments/Automated-Electrophysiology/IonWorks-Quattro.html           Such companies represent a growing $375m industry in the $60-100 billion       drug screening industry (Global Industry Analysts Inc. "Top 10 Drug       discovery technologies" Market Strategic Analysis and Global Forecasts       (2010-2015); Ion Channel Trends 2011, HTS Tec Ltd.).
Impact on drug development legislation     The development of reproducible and documented drug screens also allows       regulatory bodies produce guidelines as to how the pharmaceutical industry       can document the safety of their compounds; this necessary documentation       must be developed before human trials to minimize risk for patients       enrolled in the trial.
[c]     Societal impact     Societal impact arises from increased patient safety; by uncovering       important interactions between non-cardiac drugs and arrhythmia risk,       patient mortality is reduced.
As one example, during treatment of heroin       addicts methadone is usually prescribed but it is now known that methadone       also carries a risk for TdP.
[k] Finally, impact also arises from       replacement of animal models by suitable cell systems that have been       documented to reproduce native cell behaviour.
This not only reduces cost       and increases speed for drug testing and screening but also reduces       ethical concerns on animal use, which has important societal impact.
It       also fits with the Research Councils' desire to reduce, refine and replace       animal use where possible (see also http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/       and http://www.iacuc.org/alternate.htm).
