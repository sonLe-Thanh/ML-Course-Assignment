     4a: Change in national and international guidance for hypertension The         2011 NICE Hypertension Guideline CG127 was a partial update to       guidance from 2006 and Caulfield served on the Guideline Development Group       [8].
The 2011 analysis including data derived from ASCOT confirmed that       beta-blockers were usually less effective than a comparator drug at       reducing major cardiovascular events, particularly stroke, and showed       excess rates of new onset diabetes and should be used at step 4.
Importantly, the results from the ASCOT BP Lowering Arm when combined with       new data made a strong case for a further modification to the       Pharmacological Treatment algorithm.
This is summarised in section 12.3       page 208 of that guideline and indicated that a combination of a calcium       channel blocker and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor at step 2       therapy, first trialled in ASCOT, was superior in preventing       cardiovascular outcomes [8].
Step 2 of the algorithm was changed to       reflect this and a meta-analysis showing that calcium channel blockers       (CCB) were superior to thiazide diuretics in stroke prevention changed       priority at step 1 for over 55s to CCBs.
The NICE Hypertension Guideline       also cites publications, also based upon ASCOT, showing differential       effects of antihypertensive treatments on blood pressure variability as an       independent predictor of clinical outcomes as a further rationale for the       CCB recommendation at step 1 (CCBs were most effective at reducing       variability).
In the European Society of Hypertension Guideline 2009,       ASCOT alongside other new data supported the recommendation for equal       consideration of CCBs and ACE inhibitors [9].
4b: Change in national and international guidelines for lipid lowering     ASCOT and CARDS changed lipid-lowering guidance for primary prevention of       cardiovascular disease in people with hypertension and for those with type       2 diabetes over 40 years old who (due to lack of peer reviewed evidence)       had not been offered such drugs previously.
The Cholesterol Trialists Meta-analysis [10] informed the NICE Technology       Appraisal (TA094) and Guideline on lipid lowering (CG67) and NCCPC/RCGP       revision 2 [11, 12].
Heavily influenced by ASCOT and CARDS, it showed that       within a year of therapy, people begin to benefit and over 5 years this       translates into an overall reduction of about one fifth per mmol/L of LDL       cholesterol reduction (48 fewer per 1000 having major vascular events       among those with pre-existing CHD at baseline, compared with 25 per 1000       if no such history).
This benefit is reflected in national (NICE) [13] and       also international guidance, including American Diabetes Association,       European Diabetes Association, European Society of Cardiology and Joint       American and European Societies [14,15].
4c: Change in patient outcomes     Hypertension.
Following NICE Hypertension Guideline CG34 in 2006       the most recent Health Survey for England 2011 (chapter 3, figure 3G page       10 and table 3.12 page 31) shows evidence of improved treatment rate (12%       improvement in men and 5% in women).
The proportion of patients with good       BP control (&lt;140/90) has risen from 52% in 2006 to 62% in 2011, and       older people in particular are more tightly controlled [16].
This       improvement is likely to be due partly to ASCOT (reflected in NICE CG34)       and also to the Quality and Outcomes Framework in primary care.
Cholesterol.
From the Health Survey for England, mean levels of       total serum cholesterol were lower in men than women (5.1 and 5.2 mmol/L       respectively) in 2011 [16].
On page 2 in chapter 2 on cardiovascular       disease the 2011 survey reports 44% of men and 43% of women had total       cholesterol levels below 5 mmol/L (the `audit level' for those with CVD,       diabetes or hypertension who are on drug treatment), while only 14% and12%       respectively had levels below 4 mmol/L (current target for same group).
Since 1998 there has been a fall in mean total cholesterol of 0.5 mmol/L       in men and women, accompanied by a rise in prescriptions in England from       52,190,000 in 2008 to 61,649,000 in 2011 (page 89 Table 3.1 in BHF Heart       Statistics 2012 [17]).
This reflects the influence of lipid lowering       studies such as ASCOT, CARDS and cholesterol trialists' meta-analysis on       lipid guidelines and thus on implementation.
In Europe, mean cholesterol       varies between 50-70% above 5.2 mMol/l and 20-29% above 6.2 mMol/L which       means the findings of ASCOT and CARDS if accompanied by prevalence rates       between 30-40% for hypertension and 6-8% for diabetes have broad impact       for large numbers of the European population [17].
4d: Professional education     Caulfield has been active in promoting continuing professional       development of health professionals [15].
Hitman and Caulfield have given       international tours to disseminate the findings of ASCOT and CARDS to       health professionals and as expert advisors to groups developing national       guidelines.
4e: Patient and public engagement     Caulfield chaired a steering group that produced a National Health       Service Patient Decision Aid for the Department of Health between       September 2012-March 2013.
This is designed to explain the management of       blood pressure and specifically the NICE Guidance on Hypertension that       derives from the ASCOT study.
It is intended to answer what patients       frequently ask and help them to build an understanding of what to expect       and why it is important.
During ASCOT and ILLUMINATE the researchers held       regular open question and answer "Town Hall" meetings with participants       and their families.
The engagement of the patients and public in CV       research as a direct result of ASCOT and ILLUMINATE at this Centre has led       to patient production of videos, animations and personal statements to       encourage participation in new trials.
As a direct result of their       experience in ASCOT, the patients have acted as champions of a national       electronic volunteering system for trials called Mediguard.
Annual       meetings are held for all participants involved in the ASCOT and       ILLUMINATE Trials.
This has created a highly engaged `patients and public       engagement' group who propose, advise and support clinical trials at Queen       Mary.
