     To set the context, prior to 2008, Platt's research contributed to the       change in perception in       Scottish Government (ministerial level and civil service) about the burden       of suicidal behaviour on       Scottish society, and the urgent need to develop a comprehensive national       suicide prevention       strategy and action plan (Choose Life, published December 2002).
Platt was       involved in two       research projects and an evaluation of phase one of Choose Life, all three       studies commissioned       by the Scottish Government (Platt et al 2007, McLean et al 2008 [see       section 2 above];       http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/09/06094657/22 or       http://tinyurl.com/o8e7o3k).
The       Scottish Government gave an enthusiastic welcome to the findings of the       evaluation of Choose Life       and accepted most of the conclusions and recommendations:       http://www.chooselife.net/Publications/publication.aspx?id=40 	  orhttp://tinyurl.com/pkokadk     Since 2008, and thus within the REF period, strategic planning by the       Scottish Government and       action by local authorities has reflected the epidemiological evidence and       evaluation findings of the       research conducted by Platt and colleagues, resulting in particular in:            The improved integration of clinical services (mental ill-health and         substance misuse) into         the broader public health approach to suicide prevention;       The clarification of best practice with regard to the prevention and         treatment of `high risk'         self-harm;       The task of building a more strategic, mainstreamed and sustainable         approach to suicide         prevention at the local level;       The improvement of national and local connections with delivery in         primary care around         recognition of, and effective response to, mental health problems,         particularly depression;       The delivery of a more strategic and targeted approach to training in         suicide prevention;         and tackling socio-economic inequalities in suicidal behaviour.

Platt served on the Scottish Government's National Suicide Prevention       Working Group (2009-10)       and contributed to the development and writing of the final report.
This       report proposed a more       focused and streamlined set of objectives to inform work for the remaining       period of the strategy.
("Refreshing the national strategy and action plan to prevent suicide in       Scotland.
Report of the       National Suicide Prevention Working Group").
http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/10/26112102/13       or http://tinyurl.com/nlxjk4d     Platt also served on the Scottish Government's National Self-harm Working       Group (2009-10) and       contributed to the writing of the final report, which was issued as a       consultation document       ("Responding to self-harm in Scotland").
This report set out objectives       and principles for the       development of appropriate services to reduce self-harm.
http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/346117/0115190.pdf       or http://tinyurl.com/q25op4e     In January 2011 Platt was invited to join the National Suicide and       Self-harm Monitoring and       Implementation Group, which was tasked "to oversee the monitoring and       implementation of agreed       commitments at both the national and local levels with regards to both       suicide and self-harm"; and       "to develop an agreed monitoring framework for the delivery of the Choose       Life strategy as well as       progress in reducing suicide."
Platt has contributed to both these       objectives.
In 2012 he submitted       a report on the `Development of a framework to capture and monitor trends       in completed suicide       and its determinants in Scotland, 1979-2010', which had been commissioned       by Scottish       Government.
"The research was presented to a range of Scottish Government policy       makers, health       professionals and others on 25 January 2013.
This research has directly       influenced discussions       during our engagement process [see above]; among other things, it has       highlighted the need to       identify appropriate policy interventions to reduce female suicides and to       fully understand the       different drivers for male and female suicides within Scotland" (Geoff       Huggins, Deputy Director,       Mental Health &amp; Protection of Rights Division, Scottish Government).
[5.1]     Subsequently the Scottish Government established a Working Group to       oversee the generation of       a new strategy for the prevention of suicide and self-harm which is due to       come into effect in late       2013 (successor to Choose Life).
Platt is one of only two researchers who       have been invited to join       the Working Group.
His research findings on the epidemiology       of suicide and self-harm in       Scotland, and the monitoring framework he has devised (see above),       together with earlier research       on the effectiveness of Choose Life, were incorporated into an `engagement       paper' (published       February 2013) which was used to consult with practitioners on the scope       and contents of the new       strategy.
(http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/Services/Mental-Health/Suicide-Self-Harm/Working-Group/EngagementPaper       or http://tinyurl.com/o9m479p)     "We are aware that, in developing its engagement paper for the Scottish       suicide and self-harm       prevention strategy 2013-2023, Scottish Government consulted and       referenced Professor Platt's       research into: effective interventions to prevent suicide and self-harm in       Scotland; inequalities and       suicidal behaviour; the prevalence of self-harm in Scotland; [and] the       impact of the current `Choose       Life' strategy and action plan to prevent suicide in Scotland" (Samaritans       [5.3]).
The Scottish Government, NHS Health Scotland and Samaritans have       acknowledged that the       findings of Platt's research studies have had a major impact on the       development, implementation       and sustaining of evidence-informed suicide prevention programmes and       activities in Scotland,       which have contributed to a fall of 18% in the country's suicide rate over       the period 2002-12 [5.1,       5.2, 5.3].
