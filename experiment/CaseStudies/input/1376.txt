     Fylan's role as principal investigator on the research team that produced       the Effective Interventions       for Speeding Motorists report for the Department for Transport in 2006 led       to invitations to present       at several different forums, including the Association of Chief Police       Officers (2007), the       Parliamentary Advisory Committee on Transport Safety (2008), the National       Association of Driver       Intervention Providers annual meetings (2008, 2009), and the Road Safety       GB annual conference       (2008).
Her subsequent work on specific driver offender interventions led       to invitations to speak at       both national and international police forums, e.g.
the Police Federation       Annual Conference       (2010), and TISPOL (European road policing) (2013).
She provided research       input into several       different local authority road safety teams (including Staffordshire,       Warwickshire, Durham County       Councils, and Greater Manchester Joint Road Safety Team), specifically       around the psychological       constructs underpinning behavioural decision making, using this       information to provide driver       behavioural change programmes, and evaluation methodology.
Her input       helped road safety teams       across the UK to understand the theoretical frameworks they can use to       develop road safety       interventions for pedestrians and motorists, and the advantages and       disadvantages of different       evaluation methodologies.
Her input therefore directly led to an increase       in the quality of the       evidence base around road safety (for example, research she has advised on       can be viewed on       the Road Safety GB Knowledge Centre (http://www.roadsafetyknowledgecentre.org.uk/).
She has       disseminated this research in various forums, including during invited       presentations at several       different road safety professional conferences, such as the RosPA annual       seminar (2011), the       Brake International Road Safety Forum (2011), the annual Road Safety       Scotland seminar (2011)       (http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;frm=1&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.road-safety.org.uk%2Fdownloads%2Fresources%2Fdirections---winter-2011%2F&amp;ei=h3yLUvzhKIeR0QWl6ICQCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHxAZx8drHwyKw2Gjiqco3H_Ofxaw&amp;bvm=bv.56643336,d.d2k)       and the PACTS conference on educational alternatives to prosecution for       driver offenders (www.pacts.org.uk/docs/events/Fylan.pdf).
Fylan's research on speeding motorists led directly, in 2007, to the       formation of a steering group       with the remit of agreeing the content and delivery method of a National       Speed Awareness Course;       Fylan was the academic adviser to this group and identified the       psychological constructs that       should be addressed in these courses (http://www.driver-improvement.co.uk/index.php/home/speed-awareness-scheme).
In       2009 the National Strategic       Course Development Board was set up, which has responsibility for using       research evidence to       advise on driver offender management policies and to develop interventions       to change driver       offender behaviour.
As the lead academic on this board Fylan has made       policy recommendations       about course content and delivery, and has developed driver and rider       intervention specifications       for several different national courses:            The National Speed Awareness Course (2008) is aimed at speeding         motorists.
The National RIDE Scheme (2009) is aimed at motorbike riders who have         been involved in         a collision or who have committed an offence.
The National Driver Alert Scheme (2010) is aimed at motorists who have         been involved in a         collision and who have been driving at a standard below what would be         expected of a         careful driver.
The National Your Belt Your Life Course (2012) is aimed at drivers and         passengers not         wearing seat belts.
The National Driving 4 Change Course (2012) is aimed at motorists         whose lack of skills         resulted in an offence.
The National What's Driving Us Course (2012) is aimed at motorists         whose attitudes         resulted in an offence.
Fylan's work has been cited by the UK Transport Minster, Mike Penning       (e.g.
Jan 2011) and by the       Road Safety Lead in ACPO, Chief Constable Suzette Davenport in their       statements on dealing with       offender motorists (`There is a report that has been done that looks at       the national driver offender       retraining schemes-NDORS.
That has not been released yet, but that is very       positive in terms of       the impact.
It is hugely positive' &#8212;     http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmtran/uc1738-iii/uc173801.htm).
Promoting the uptake of these courses have been included in the       Department for Transport       Strategic Framework for Road Safety (2011, 2012):     ps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/8147/action-plan-update.pdfps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/8147/action-plan-update.pdf;     https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/8146/strategicframework.pdf).
Fylan's work has also been influential in policy decisions       internationally, and she has been       consulted by key government personnel, for example by the Australian       Office of Road Safety,       when exploring how to apply the UK model of driver interventions in their       own countries (e.g.
research report AP-T134/09, Development of a Best Practice Intervention       Model for Recidivist Speeding Offenders,       https://www.onlinepublications.austroads.com.au/items/AP-T134-09).
The beneficiaries of this research are therefore:            The police, who have an evidence-based policy for handling offender         drivers.
Road safety professionals, who have benefited from direct advice         and/or access to         presentations made by Dr Fylan.
Offender drivers, who can choose to attend an evidence-based         intervention to address their         driving behaviour, rather than receive a fine and licence penalty         points.
The courses have         contributed to a reduction in speeding offences.
Road users more generally, who benefit from safer road environments.
