     McKillop's research led to his appointment to positions of influence by       the Governments in the       Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland, as follows:            September 2009, appointed by Minister for Finance (Ireland) Brian         Lenihan to The         Credit Union Advisory Committee to advise the Minister, the Central Bank         and such others as         the Minister thinks fit in relation to the improvement of the management         of credit unions and         the protection of the interests of members and creditors;       May 2011, appointed by Minister for Finance (Ireland) Michael Noonan         as Chair of the         Commission on Credit Unions;       March 2012, appointed by the Office of the First Minister and Deputy         First Minister         (Northern Ireland) to an Advisory Group to consider the scope for         intervention by the Northern         Ireland Executive to alleviate financial hardship arising from         implementation of Welfare         Reform legislation.
Major impacts of his research have included:     Republic of Ireland       In 2010, Minister Lenihan requested that the Credit Union Advisory       Committee (CUAC)       develop a stabilisation framework for credit unions.
The framework was       developed drawing       almost exclusively on McKillop's work (output 4).
It includes a       deposit insurance mechanism       to protect members' savings, a stabilisation mechanism to stabilise credit       unions in temporary       difficulty, appropriate regulatory oversight and intervention to ensure       adequate capitalisation       and a failure resolution mechanism.
In 2011 and 2012, The Commission on Credit Unions (Chair McKillop) made       extensive use of       McKillop's research in its Report, including:     (i) the credit union typology classifying Irish credit unions as       transitional with the       implication that policy change in Ireland should be informed by the mature       movements       in North America (output 1);     (ii) efficiency studies of Irish credit unions which suggests that there       is under-       performance and that significant restructuring of the sector is required,       again       benchmarked against research on other credit union movements.
(outputs         3 and 6);     (iii) prior and current work on governance for Ireland, the US and Canada       which       suggests that the credit union governance model is diluted as a movement       matures,       with weaknesses emerging in the governance of many Irish credit unions,       particularly       around director selection and training, (outputs 2 and 7); and     (iv) research on performance and restructuring of credit unions in       Ireland and the US       (outputs 2 and 5).
Minister of Finance Michael Noonan TD wrote, after the publication of the       Commission's First       Report: "I have examined the Report and I agreed the recommendations.
I         have asked my         officials to proceed now with whatever steps are required to have each         recommendation         implemented, including the preparation of heads of bill for submission         to Government."
(28       October 2011)     Following publication of the Final Report, the Minister wrote: "I         would like to reiterate my         satisfaction, and that of my Government colleagues, that the Commission         provided a quality         Report containing in depth analysis and far reaching         recommendations...." (13 July 2012)       He also stated that the Report "will inform Government policy on credit         unions for the         foreseeable future".
Directly stemming from the Commission's work was the Credit Union and       Co-operation with       Overseas Regulators Bill 2012 passed by the Irish Parliament in December       2012, and the       establishment of a Credit Union Restructuring Board in September 2012.
The 2012 Bill has five parts and provides for (i) Prudential       Requirements, (ii) Governance, (iii)       Stabilisation, (iv) Restructuring and (v) Amendments to the Credit Union       Act 1997.
The Restructuring Board will oversee the restructuring of the Irish       credit union movement on a       voluntary, incentivised and time-bound basis.
Credit unions approved for       restructuring through       amalgamations or transfers will be provided with funding to ensure they       have adequate capital       and to enable them to upgrade their technology and other systems.
North America       McKillop's research on credit unions (output 5) has influenced       Government bodies in the US.
His work on the drivers of credit union consolidation is cited in a 2012       US Government       Accountability Office report which considers the impact of the Dodd-Frank       Act and focuses in       particular on issues relating to consolidation.
McKillop was commissioned by the Filene Research Institute, US (a credit       union think tank)       and Credit Union Central Canada (the national trade association for the       Canadian credit union       system) to undertake research on governance in US and Canadian credit       unions.
There are       800 credit unions in Canada with over CAN$250bn in assets.
The published       report (output 7)       was disseminated to credit unions worldwide.
