     Following the underpinning research at Imperial College that led to the       demonstration of a family of       high average power, fibre-based lasers operating throughout the visible       and the near infra-red,       impact has been identified and acknowledged by the commercialization of       the developed systems       and in the application of the lasers in diverse medical treatments.
From 2006 to 2010 Dr Popov College held a Royal Society Industrial       Research Fellowship, which       was undertaken in association with IPG Photonics.
During this time and in       collaboration with Dr       Popov, the IPG group of companies undertook the commercial development of       several of the high       power fibre laser systems that had been researched at Imperial College, in       particular, the (i)       frequency doubled Yb and Yb:Er fibre lasers, (ii) MOPFA type fundamental       and frequency doubled       Raman fibre lasers and (iii) the Thulium based system operating around       2&#181;m. In a letter, IPG       Photonics confirms that in "we established a mutually beneficial         programme to investigate the         frequency doubling of Yb based MOPFAs (master oscillator power fibre         amplifiers) in periodically         poled materials.
The thrust of that programme was to use controlled seed         signals from laser diodes         or fibre lasers and to amplify these to moderately high average powers,         in the many tens of watts         regime, before efficient frequency doubling in various poled crystals.
The programme was very         successful and deploying Yb, Er and Raman based amplifiers in various         formats, tuneable red,         green, yellow and blue sources were demonstrated at tens of watts         average power" [A].
It confirms       that in "the past few years, with further development, IPG have         commercialized the high power         green system based upon SHG [second-harmonic generation] in crystals         pumped by seeded Yb         fibre lasers and these highly reliable and efficient systems should         rapidly replace large frame         inefficient Argon ion lasers and other traditional solid state solutions"       [A].
Regarding sales of the visible fibre laser systems developed from the       original research programme       of the Imperial group, IPG confirms that "In the past few years sales         of green systems has         exceeded 100 units of various specification, with the power in this         family of devices now exceeding         100W at 530nm and associated revenue was in excess of 3 million US$.
Sales of Raman based         units exceed those of the 530nm system."
[A]     The marriage of MOPFA technology with frequency doubling techniques in       simple configurations       has led to the commercialization of a family of compact and efficient high       power lasers with       exceptional wavelength coverage.
With the lasers fundamentally based upon       developments in       telecommunications and through the use of telecommunications specified       components, this has led       to greater reliability and simplification, such that the basic commercial       laser product requires no       maintenance and is characterised by a simple user interface that requires       no laser optimization       procedures.
As a consequence, the systems are in demand in the       applications market place and       this is best exemplified by the medical laser market, where the       reliability, compactness, no need for       servicing and cost reduction of fibre based laser medical systems has had       instant impact.
Over the period 2006-2010, high power Thulium fibre lasers operating at       1940nm were developed       in collaboration with IPG Photonics for applications in surgery.
The water       peak absorption of tissue       at 1940nm allows for faster ablation and tissue removal compared to       procedures developed for the       Holmium laser at 2100nm.
A 120W laser system was developed utilizing       single transverse mode       pumping from a Yb:Er laser system - the Thulium Fiber Laser System [B].
Collaborative clinical       trials were instigated at the Chelyabinsk Medical Centre, Russia and at       StarMedTech in Germany.
StarMedTech, an international medical technology company specialising in       surgical laser system       technology, also includes a 120W 1.9&#181;m Thulium laser in its product line &#8212;       the vela&#174; XL laser [C].
This laser is advertised for use in "urology, gynecology, ENT,         pneumology, neurology and surgery"       [C].
As with the IPG Photonics 1940nm lasers, due "to its high         absorption in water, the optimized         wavelength of 1.9&#181;m is ideal for haemostatic cutting of soft and hard         tissue" [C].
Dr Popov and the Femtosecond Optics Group at Imperial College have       collaborated closely with       the Medical Laser Division of IPG in the development, trials and       commercialization of several fibre       laser platforms for various medical procedures, some of which are now       routinely applied.
This is       confirmed in a letter by NTO-IRE Polus (part of the IPG Photonics       Corporation): "The research and         development in fiber lasers at Imperial College, followed by         commercialization by IPG Photonics         allowed us to develop integrated medical devices, conduct trials and         qualify medical technologies         for surgery, ENT, gynaecological, prostate treatments and vein therapy         in Russia, Germany and         USA" [D].
In Russia alone "over one thousand ENT operations were         successfully performed on 330         patients, 3.5 to 66 year old, in the Second Central Medical Clinic using         Raman and Er fiber laser         based surgical instruments.
In Chelyabinsk at the Medical and Physics         Center of the Chelyabinsk         State Medical Academy 104 patients, age 34 to 68, with gynaecological         problems were         successfully treated using Tm fiber laser based devices" [D].
Further confirmation of the medical impact of the fiber lasers comes from       the University of Illinois at       Chicago.
The director of the Dental Emergency Medicine Responder Training       (DEMRT) Office       confirms "Dr. Popov and I have collaborated in the research and         development (R&amp;D) of fiber based         lasers for medical and dental spectroscopy, diagnostics, non-surgical,         and surgical applications         since 2008.
His applied and clinical laser device and applications         research, for laser based         diagnostics, dentistry, medicine, and surgery, have been critical for         our clinical needs...We have         collaborated with a number of medical centers and companies across the         world, all of whom         express continued interest in developing new medical and dental devices         and procedures for         global and international health needs...The lasers developed at Imperial         College have been         commercialized by IPG Photonics and applied in medical applications such         as dentistry, oral         surgery, ENT, gynecology, prostate treatment; aesthetics and have         already passed medical trials         and certification in Russia, Europe, USA and Asia."
[E]     The important role of Dr Popov and the Femtosecond Group in the       commercialization of the fiber       laser sources is nicely summarized in the following additional quotes: "Dr         Popov's input has been         an important and vital ingredient in the route to commercialization [of       medical laser systems]" [A],       and "The results of the research conducted by Dr Popov at Femtosecond         Group at Imperial         College in collaboration with IPG Photonics have clearly resulted in         practical apparatus which was         successfully applied to novel low-invasive medical treatments" [D].
