     The research has produced several key intersecting impacts:     i) Securing of the role of Primary Mental Health Workers in YOTs and        LAC's Teams in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland.
(1)     The most immediate impact of the research was that the role of the PMHW       within YOT and LAC was secured in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland,       as evidenced in the 2002-2009 CAMHS strategy (1).
The Young People's Team       in Leicester was commended for its accessibility to LAC in the county's       2011-12 Ofsted report.
ii) The model developed here was fed into a network of projects       nationally for work by Primary Mental Health Workers working in contexts       with difficult to access and difficult to engage populations.
As an outcome of her research on the role of PMHWs, Callaghan       participated in a range of initiatives to help develop both the role of       Primary Mental Health Worker in CAMHS, and to support appropriate training       for this new category of worker.
(2) These developments linked directly to       research expertise in the PMHW role.
Emergent from this network was the       development of the PMHW Competency and Capability Framework, issued in       April 2005     Dr Callaghan participated in the Primary Mental Health Workers Higher       Education Institution network, a network of trainers involved in       developing training for PMHWs.
The University of Northampton was awarded       &#163;25,000 by the DOH to develop specialist training for PMHWs at the       University of Northampton.
This was seed funding to enable the development       of Masters level training for NHS staff who needed to develop the key       competencies to work as PMHWs.
Dr Callaghan also led training events for       PMHWs (some of this was in the previous RAE cycle).
The CHIMAT (Child and       Maternal Health) training event in Birmingham, at which Callaghan was a       keynote speaker, included Primary Mental Health Workers from around the       country, and contributed significantly to the development of the PMHW role       in CAMHS (3).
iii) Building on our established expertise in Primary Mental Health         work, the university is part of a network of Universities and Mental         Health service providers, training staff in the NHS to broaden access to         mental health services for children and young people.
Dr Callaghan is         leading the evaluation of this training project, across the Midlands and         East of England, and the development of training in Core Competencies in         CAMHS.
(5)     As CAMHS workforce development has shifted in focus towards the       development of an Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT)       programme, Dr Callaghan has been instrumental in the development of       training to support IAPT across the Midlands and East of England, as a       steering group member of the Children and Young Persons' IAPT programme.
This includes the development of level 6 training for CAMHS staff in       working at the tier 1 / tier 2 interface, and leading regional evaluation       of IAPT linked initiatives in the Midlands and East of England.
(5, 8 and       9)     This project focuses on broadening young people's access to mental health       services, embedding evidence based practice in services and developing,       and facilitating young people's involvement in service planning and       delivery.
25 NHS and Counselling staff have completed the two CPD module in 2013,       developing skills in work with children and young people, developing       skills in working with young people's mental health needs in primary care       contexts.
These students have noted that the programme has built their       confidence and knowledge in working with children and young people with       mental health difficulties who do not currently meet the referral       threshold for specialist CAMHS services.
(10) A MOOC is in development to       broaden the reach of these CPD modules to NHS and other mental health       staff round the country.
iv) In Northamptonshire, Dr Callaghan is leading an initiative for the         University of Northampton, working in partnership with the         Northamptonshire Health Foundation Trust to develop a model for Primary         Mental Health Workers to support counselling staff working in schools,         and through youth counselling agencies.
Funded by the former East         Midlands Strategic Health Authority, Dr Callaghan is leading on the         development of counsellor training, and evaluating the intervention.
She         is also a member of the Northamptonshire Young Healthy Minds Partnership         Board, which shapes regional policy and commissioning patterns in CAMHS.
(4)     This project has significant implications in terms of broadening young       people's access to psychological therapies, by providing services to young       people with `low threshold' mental health difficulties (low mood, anxiety       etc) to intervention.
(4) The project is therefore widening access to       psychological therapies for young people, and embedding the principles of       evidence based counselling and routine outcomes monitoring in work with       children and young people.
v) Building on Primary Mental Health training programmes funded by the         Department of Health, the University of Northampton has led the         development of training programmes for professionals from the UK, EU,         Asia and Africa in working with children and adolescents in primary care         and early intervention settings.
This training has blossomed into one of the most successful MSc       programmes in Child and Adolescent Mental Health in the country, with a       broad reaching programme that has trained students from India, China,       Southern and East Africa, Sri Lanka and Nepal in the skills needed to       provide good quality mental health services for children and young people.
(6) Students have built the skills in direct work, consultation and       liaison that are key competences for Primary Mental Health Work, and this       has impacted positively on their work with children and families, and       their career development.
(7)     This work is being taken forward through the establishing of a strong       collaborative at the University of Northampton, where CAMHS linked       research is a growing area of interest.
In 2013, Dr Callaghan and the       CAMHS team at the University of Northampton convened a three day CAMHS       Conference, drawing together practitioners and academic researchers both       from around the UK, and internationally.
