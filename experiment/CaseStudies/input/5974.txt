     Issues concerning reparations are of major contemporary importance.
However, there is very little clarity about how we should implement these       legal provisions.
Sandoval's work has therefore filled an important gap       and had a formative influence in legal applications of the concept of       reparations.
Expert Advice for the ICC, the UN, and other Courts     In July 2005 a Vice President of the International Criminal Court invited       Sandoval to work as a visiting professional at the Court to advise her on       how to understand reparations.
Sandoval's research on the Inter-American       Court was particularly valuable to her role as advisor, as at this stage       the IAC was the only court with a clearly defined treatment of       reparations.
This advice to the ICC has led to the research impacting on       ICC judgements during the REF period 2008-2013.
Both the ICC and the UN       have contacted Sandoval on multiple occasions since 2008 to provide them       with expert advice on reparations for gross human rights violations and       international crimes.
For example, the ICC's report on the case of the Democratic Republic of       Congo v Thomas Lubanga Dyilo includes an annex written by Sandoval       [corroborating source 1].
This annex details the understanding of       reparations in the IACHR and is based on her research in this area       (2009b).
The guidance given in the ICC report makes multiple references to       practices in the IAHCR and cites both Sandoval's annex and the briefing       papers written by her students and based on her research.
The ICC judged       on the Lubanga case &#8212; its first judgement on reparation &#8212; in August 2012.
The Vice President of the ICC, who was also one of Judges on the Lubanga       judgement, has personally communicated her thanks to Sandoval for bringing       the ICC's attention to relevant cases in the IAC, which guided their final       judgement:     I want to thank you for all your support over many years and the generous       contribution that you always gave me to fine tune the many ideas that       there are.
You were decisive when from the beginning you made me aware of       the importance of the Inter-American Court.
Vice President of the International Criminal Court     Other examples of Court use of Sandoval's reparations work include:            In 2009 Sandoval used her research in an amicus curiae brief on         reparations for the Inter-American Court `Cotton Field' v Mexico case.
In accordance with convention, the final judgment did not quote the         brief, but the Court did acknowledge the brief [corroborating source 3,         para 14], as the only brief dealing with reparation to be submitted to         the Court, and it is clear from the judgment that many of the views put         forward in the brief were taken on board by the Court [full analysis of         the court decision reflecting the brief is available as corroborating         source 4].
Sandoval, in collaboration with legal charity and NGO Redress (see         below), is currently using her research to litigate the case of Garcia         Lucero v Chile at the Inter-American Court.
Leopoldo Garcia Lucero and         others are seeking reparations for human rights violations under         Pincohet.
The case has received international media attention (see for         instance The Guardian [source 5]).
Redress     Sandoval's research on reparations has also had significant impact on the       activities of international human rights NGO Redress, with whom Sandoval       had collaborated to produce some of the underpinning research (2009a).
Redress has used her work in a number of submissions to a range of courts       including the International Criminal Court:            Sandoval was asked by Redress to write its January 2010 amicus curiae         brief for the case of Manuel Cruz Cavalcanti [source 6].
Here Sandoval         used her research on rehabilitation to argue that Cavalcanti was         entitled to both greater monetary compensation and other forms of         rehabilitation.
In January 2011 the court awarded Cavalancti greater         monetary compensation, in accordance with Sandoval's brief [source 7].
Aside from the Redress report written by Sandoval, a second Redress         report on the concepts of reparations and victim [source 8] makes         multiple references to her publication on the concepts of injured party         and victim (2009b).
This report has formed a major part of their         campaigning and was submitted to the ICC to advise on how to award         reparations.
Sandoval's report on Rehabilitation, written for Redress, has been         used by the NGO in much of their international legal campaigning.
The         report was cited in Redress' discussion paper submission to the         Government of Rwanda regarding reparations for survivors of genocide         [source 9], in which Redress argue that rehabilitation `should include         medical and psychological care as well as legal and social services'         (p.6).
Sandoval's Redress report on rehabilitation has impacted not only on the       campaigns of Redress but also on the UN Committee Against Torture (UNCAT).
Her report recommends that UNCAT write a General Comment on Article 14 of       the Convention Against Torture, which deals with reparations for torture       victims, including rehabilitation.
This recommendation was a contributing       factor to UNCAT's decision to publish, in December 2012, a General Comment       on Article 14.
Sandoval was subsequently consulted and interviewed by members of the       Committee responsible for the drafting of the General Comment and her       publications were circulated to Committee members.
The influence of       Sandoval's research on the General Comment is most evident in its section       concerning rehabilitation, which states that `the provision of means for       as full rehabilitation as possible...should be holistic and include       medical and psychological care as well as legal and social services'       [source 10].
The influence of Sandoval's research was attested in comments       made by a member of UNCAT, Nora Sveaass.
In a paper given by Dr Sveaass to       the Washington College of Law Sveaass said that Sandoval's Redress report       `gives a very good and comprehensive review on the history of       rehabilitation in treaties, declarations, and conventions on human rights,       and in particular reparation' [source 11].
