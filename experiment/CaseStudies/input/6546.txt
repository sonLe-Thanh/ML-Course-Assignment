     The research was disseminated in two main ways, each having its own       distinctive but complementary impact:     1.
Shakespeare in Hackney; or, `Tis a mad world at Hoxton,         by Peter Howell and Matthew Hahn (Drama St Mary's), dir.
Matthew Hahn,         starring Jack Klaff.
This is a redacted and dramatised version of the poem, produced in       collaboration with the Theatre Arts team of St. Mary's University College.
It was premiered on 23 May 2013 at Hoxton Hall, a theatre in Hoxton,       London, close to the location of the Pimlyco tavern in the early 1600s,       and was followed by a lecture by Peter Howell on the poem, the local       history of the area and its relevance to The Tempest.
A recording       of the performance is available at www.otranto.co.uk/index.php/pages/index/pimlyco-13.
A total of 78 people bought tickets for the performance, and they were       asked to fill in a questionnaire concerning attitudes to Hoxton, and       attitudes to Shakespeare.
25 completed questionnaires were received (the       questionnaire can be found at the end of this section), a summary of which       follows:            24 of the 25 respondents lived at least three miles from Hoxton; 5 of         the respondents came to Hoxton `between 1 and 5 times per year' or more         often, and the rest had `hardly ever' or `never' been to Hoxton.
As         such, there is evidence that the performance drew an audience into an         area with which they were not previously familiar.
Respondents were asked to write up to four words to sum up the reputation         of Hoxton, and up to four words to sum up their own opinion of it,         having seen the show.
Many predictable responses came up in both         categories &#8212; `grungy', `edgy', `up-and-coming', but some transformative         effects were evident:                                     How often in Hoxton           Reputation           wn Opinion                             Hardly ever           White poverty enclave           Less isolated than that                             Never           Didn't know where it was           Very Londonish                             Never           Village atmosphere?

The respondents were quite knowledgeable about Shakespeare, with all         but two having either read or seen at least `11-20' plays in the past         ten years.
16 had studied his work at university level, with all the         rest having studied it either to GCSE or A-Level (or equivalents).
There were not many answers to question 13 (the `open' question),         possibly because the optional nature of it was emphasised in order not         to lead respondents too much, but below are some of the responses         received, indicating that the performance encouraged the audience to         re-evaluate perceptions of Shakespeare and his work:         `An excellent exposition of the context of Shakespeare's writings'           `It brought home for me the creative atmosphere Shakespeare was           working in &#8212; I didn't really know anything about his influences and           other contemporary writers'           `It has enlivened again my interest in Shakespeare'           `Interesting to hear possibilities of where Shakespeare drew his ideas           from and also the idea of an island as a space inland!'
`Emphasised how his work is rooted in London/English society'       	           2.
Text of Pimlyco; or Run Red Cap &#8212; `Tis a mad world at           Hogsdon and related discussions on www.otranto.co.uk     Following the performance of the poem, the text of the original pamphlet,       together with recordings of the performance and an academic paper on the       poem, were made available online in an innovative new format for the       interactive publication of academic texts created by St Mary's scholars: www.otranto.co.uk.
After the paper       was published by the journal Literary London, it was taken down       from the otranto site, but for the three months it was on there       (June-August 2013) it attracted a high standard of discussion,       particularly on the nature of the poem's relationship to The Tempest.
Discussion of the text of Pimlyco itself can be viewed at       http://www.otranto.co.uk/index.php/publication/view/52.
At the time of       writing this site is still an on-going project, but it raises the       possibility of increased interaction with community and non-specialist       readers interested in the local history of east London, and in       Shakespeare.
