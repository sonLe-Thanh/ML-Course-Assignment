     Impact has been generated by two routes.
The first is through the       synthesis of porous solids and the capability for tuning porosities in       both adsorbent and catalyst synthesis.
The second is through improvements       to thermal analytical techniques and the new information available on the       structure/function relationships in solid-state systems.
The techniques       have been used in the characterisation of catalytic materials and       pyrotechnic materials, with the associated benefits to users and to       manufacturers, including global companies and the defence industry.
We have been working with Johnson Matthey (JM) since 1999 (as ICI/Synetix       in the early years), applying controlled-rate techniques to catalysts and       catalyst precursors with a view both to strengthening the understanding of       the processes that occur in the preparation of solid catalysts and to       improving the properties of solid catalysts prepared by thermal methods.
Our (Parkes' and Barnes') work with JM, based on that reported in       references A1-A3 above, has illustrated the potential for controlling       catalyst morphology, especially in calcined materials, so offering the       prospect to tune key catalyst properties.
Through both our early       fundamental work and the continuing collaboration with JM, knowledge       transfer to JM has occurred.
Impact has been felt by JM throughout the       assessment period and continues to be felt today.
The Catalysis R and D       Director at JM, describes the research as "crucial for our           understanding of how to scale and optimise manufacturing processes for           materials development.
This has clear implications for economic and           environmental benefits for our manufacturing processes and end-users           of our products".
[S1]     Joint research with Dstl, Porton Down over a similar period (Parkes and       Brown) has been aimed at the use of controlled-rate techniques to tailor       porosity characteristics in activated carbons.
The objectives were to       increase understanding of the synthesis/preparative factors that control       the properties of carbon adsorbents, and also to improve the extent to       which activated carbons can be characterised.
This work (reference A3       above) was ultimately aimed at improving carbon adsorbents for personal       respirator use by improving the balance between effective adsorption       performance and resistance to airflow.
The benefits in these directions       were witnessed at Dstl in the 2008-2010 period and the Chief Scientist       (Physical Sciences Dept), Porton Down, reports that:.... (Our         collaborative work) "has greatly increased our understanding of the         factors that affect the performance of activated carbons used in         respirator filters including the influence of metal impregnants and pore         structure on removal of toxic chemicals from contaminated airstreams.
In         particular the controlled-rate activation methods developed           at Huddersfield have enable excellent control over the properties of           activated carbons, resulting in significant improvements in adsorbent           performance and their long-term stability".
[S2]     A similar approach to tuning carbon pore structures using controlled-rate       techniques has recently been applied to carbon adsorbents for use in       cigarette filters (2008-date, funded by BAT).
[B1] The joint research       (Parkes) has shown that it is possible to change the internal structure of       an activated carbon derived from an environmentally-preferred       vegetable-based source to maximise its adsorption properties when       operating under high flow rates.
The Research Manager at BAT confirms that       in the period since 2010 "significant enhancements in the adsorption of         some key smoke toxicants were achieved (using the methods developed       in Huddersfield) compared to the use of conventional materials".
[S3]       An international patent with BAT has been granted.
[B2]     Our expertise and unique capability in adsorption calorimetric techniques       have been applied to work with MEL Chemicals (Brown).
Over the period from       2003 we have been using these techniques, based on references A4 and A5       above, to characterise modified zirconia catalysts, significantly       increasing the company's understanding of the structure/function       relationship in these materials.
Impact has been felt in two areas.
The       first is in designing doped zirconias with controlled acidity/basicity for       use mainly in auto catalysts but also in gas clean-up catalysts [B3]       (2008-2011).
The second is in the design of lithium zirconate catalysts       for biodiesel synthesis (2011-13).
A patent was filed on our joint work on       lithium ziroconate in 2012 [B4] and the work has been presented at       numerous conferences.
The Divisional Research and Development Director       says that this work has "strengthened our product range.
In           monetary terms, the joint research has certainly brought benefit to           MEL".
[S4]     Over the period 2000 to date, Charsley has been carrying out research       with the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, QinetiQ Ltd, armasuisse,       Switzerland and the Finnish Defence Forces.
In this work a series of       advanced and unique thermal analytical techniques (based on reference A6       above) have been used to characterise the strongly exothermic reactions of       a range of pyrotechnic compositions, with a view to designing new       materials using more benign compounds than those that have traditionally       been used, particularly perchlorates.
[B5] This has resulted in a series       of new formulations (introduced 2008-2010) based on magnesium alloy-sodium       nitrate-calcium resinate compositions.
The overall programme was sponsored       by the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Programme (SERDP),       US Department of Defence and in 2009 was awarded the SERDP Project of         the Year Prize.
The Principal Capability Group Leader at QinetiQ       involved in this work confirms that the contribution of Huddersfield "was         pivotal to the consortium being awarded the project (in competition with         US research laboratories) and the prize", adding that "the         reputation of your team and quality of work performed at Huddersfield         has allowed the UK to benefit from a number of long term international         collaborative studies on pyrotechnics and novel materials".
[S5]       Through facilitating the study of these reactive materials, says QinetiQ,       the University has "contributed to defence research both in the UK           and internationally".
