     Food production is the largest manufacturing sector within the UK.
The       annual turnover is &#163;76.2bn turnover with a gross value added of &#163;20.9bn       and this accounts for 16% of total UK manufacturing industry.
Around 13%       of the people employed in manufacturing in the UK work in the food and       drink industry and it is of particular significance in our local East       Midlands region where 21% of manufacturing jobs are in the food sector.
Large multinational corporations lead the industry, but hundreds of small       and medium enterprises make a significant contribution to the market,       again the proportion is particularly high within the East Midlands.
Innovation, sustainability and efficiency in the industry are often       dependent upon relationships between manufacturers, processors and       academic researchers.
The long-term commitment of Food Sciences at the       University of Nottingham (UoN) to understanding the interactions between       materials and processing and the implications of phase change (the       transitions of biopolymers from crystalline to amorphous forms) has       brought about a range of benefits to the industry at international,       national and local levels.
UoN researchers took a fundamental approach to       understanding these processes and transferred the knowledge to industry.
Engagement with companies has enabled the commercial utilization of the       growing knowledge base.
It has been the wisdom accumulated through many       UoN research projects, that has impacted on the thinking and activities of       food and biomaterials companies large and small.
As described below, UoN engagement with companies has been extensive and       the dissemination and knowledge transfer in relation to biopolymers       impacts on the sustainability and competiveness of those using       biomaterials, within the food and other industries.
Small company activity: The knowledge base       generated by UoN research has been effectively disseminated to smaller       businesses, particularly to those in the East Midlands.
Food and Drink       enterprises are a key economic driver in the East Midlands, worth &#163;1.6       billion.
Along with Yorkshire and Humber regions, the East Midlands is the       country's biggest food manufacturing centre.
Working closely with the Food       and Drink iNet (The Food and Drink innovation Network was established in       2008 to co-ordinate specialist support to stimulate innovation in the food       and drink industry), UoN has played a key role in increasing the       effectiveness of local industry, through knowledge and technology transfer       (Source 1).
Two major EU grants have provided impetus for this       knowledge exchange and support for the smaller companies within the East       Midlands.
UoN expertise on biopolymers has been transferred to SMEs       through the UoN Starch Processing Centre (2008-2011).
Since inception, 66       separate business support activities occurred with 55 different companies.
From this activity 621 people were assisted in their skills development,       drawing on the expertise of the UoN researchers.
This activity was       extended through the addition of lipids to the Centre (award 2013-2015)       and the concomitant addition of new interactions with the small companies.
This makes UoN a key partner in achieving business goals for many food       companies (Source 1).
National relevance: Supporting commercial operation       within the UK food industry by increasing the knowledge base on       crystalline-amorphous behaviour of biopolymers is of major strategic       importance.
There are many examples where UoN expertise has helped       companies establish their unique selling points, by allowing them to use       scientific knowledge and measurements based upon UoN expertise to create       innovative products.
An example of this would be GA Pet Foods a       manufacturer of own-label innovative petfood.
The Managing Director of the       company stated (2013), "GA Pet Foods has invested in excess of &#163;18         million in the last three years for the innovative manufacture of dry         pet foods.
We are particularly interested in using sources of animal         protein that shorten the supply chain and do not impact upon the         resources being used for human foods.
To do this novel manufacturing         technologies are required, as well as an understanding of the         nutritional benefits that could be gained (Source 2)."
These technologies have been derived from the research work led by UoN.
"To         limit risks and provide a credible background for the work, an academic         partner with a history of processing and an understanding of the         nutritional requirements of animals was necessary.
The group at         Biosciences at Nottingham are leaders in this field and have a proven         record of industrial collaboration" (2013, Source 2).
The       retention of a critical mass of technological/research expertise within       the UK is essential for a vibrant food industry.
McCain Foods, the world's       largest producer of French fries and other oven-ready frozen food products       state that "no small part of the decision" to base their global       batter group in the UK came from their knowledge exchange collaboration       with UoN (Source 3).
International Engagement: Many international       companies use expertise from UoN in support of their manufacturing       developments.
Pepsico is an American multinational food and beverage       corporation with interests in the manufacturing, marketing and       distribution of grain-based snack foods, beverages, and other products.
A       statement from the Head of Breakthrough Foods R&amp;D at Pepsico confirms,       "The Nottingham group have proven themselves to be a key partner for         Pepsico in Europe and globally in support of our Foods business,         predominately though a combination of their scientific leadership in the         area of starch and other complex carbohydrates, and their partnership         orientated approach to working with industry" (Source 4,       2013).
UoN have acted as first port of call to aid in translation       of upcoming technologies for many other companies.
Key areas of knowledge       transfer have been particularly in the field of alternative raw materials       and novel processing (Source 2,) and much of this work has been       based around enabling companies to understand and monitor factors allowing       fat and salt reduction in their products (2-3,6 and e).
Pepsico       confirm that, "Knowhow created within Biosciences at Nottingham has         been used to understand expansion and quality of such products.
Providing a mechanistic understanding of the starch &#8212; biopolymer matrix         that enabled the PepsiCo researchers to devise a new approach to product         formulation ultimately led to a successful product re-launch of our Oven         baked chips from Lays into the Netherlands and Belgium.
We first         launched Baked Lays in the Netherlands in 2008 and relaunched in 2010         with the dramatically improved product design which as a strong         contributor to the very strong sales uplift we saw post re-launch &#8212; the         product is held to be one of the best Baked Lays product designs in         PepsiCo today."
(Source 4, 2013).
Similarly the Director of       Fundamental and Applied Research at McCain Foods states, "McCain's         Fundamental Applied Research team has maintained a collaborative         relationship with Nottingham University for the past 5 years.
In this         time the project has produced multiple positive developments".
"The         information and knowledge gained has allowed McCain to complete a long         term project in the highly relevant area of fat reduction after many         years of work leading to a quantifiable increase in sales and volume.
A         second project which has real process innovation at its core, again         based on starches in our applications, will help us significantly reduce         our wastage on a global scale."

Due to the fundamental approach taken by UoN researchers (a-d, 1-6),       links with industry and raw material processing have extended from food       materials to other biomaterials.
UoN is a founding member of the European       Polysaccharide Network of Excellence (EPNOE) and within this organisation       has helped establish the links between crystalline-amorphous behaviour       cellulose and starch which can be applied to non-food materials (Source         5).
The commercial significance of this is confirmed by a 2013       statement from the Head of Global Development and Innovation Textiles at       Lenzing Aktiengesellschaft (Source 6), "Lenzing AG is an         Austrian based company specializing in man- made cellulose fibres         including the non-woven modal and lyocell (TENCEL&#174;) fibers.
The tonnage         of fibre produced is ~900,000 per annum and annual sales are in the         region of &#8364;2,000 million...
The Lenzing Group prides itself in leading         this industrial field through innovation and technology.
The concepts         put forward within the European Network of Excellence in Polysaccharides         and the comparative understandings between starch and cellulose, led by         the team based in Food Sciences at the University of Nottingham, have         been of considerable interest to Lenzing AG.
This has contributed to our         understanding of the properties of semi crystalline materials and how         mixtures of polymers may be of use in developing new materials with a         commercial application.
New processes from these findings are being         considered for commercialisation".
Dissemination of knowledge: The knowledge generated by food       scientists at UoN across three decades has generated a body expertise that       has been made accessible to small and large businesses.
Between 2008 and       2013, the transfer of this knowledge has been a driver for product       reformulation (Source 4), innovation (Sources 3 and 6),       waste reduction (Source 3) and the promotion of a critical mass of       expertise in the industry (Sources 1 and 3).
A key element of this       knowledge transfer from UoN to the local and global food industry has been       effective participation and engagement with opportunities for       dissemination.
For example, the Food Standards Agency, as part of the       European Salt Action Network (ESAN), which was set up under the auspices       of the World Health Organisation, asked UoN to supply an expert talk at a       meeting hosted in Malta for the EU on salt perception and flavour (Source         7).
Similarly UoN research to improve understanding of the       commercial implications of sodium reduction was disseminated to industry       through invitations, requested by Pepsico (Source 4) to give       knowledge transfer presentations on the relevance of Salt Reduction and       Processing at the American Cereal Chemist Association (Source 8).
UoN also participates in knowledge transfer activity through direct       engagement with companies.
For example, Mars established a       multidisciplinary research collaboration with Prof. Hill, which informed       strategy for their petfood business.
