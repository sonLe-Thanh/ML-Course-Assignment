     The impact of Blair's research can be seen clearly in three main areas of       public life:     Current planning and policy       Blair's work on churches and the landscape is regularly cited in local         authority planning documents, of which Oxford City Council's Urban         Resource Assessment and Research Agenda 2011 is a notable       example, Blair's work being cited more than 96 times [i].
To quote David       Radford (Oxford City Archaeologist): "I definitely use [Blair's] work on a       regular basis when dealing with central Oxford sites" [1].
As Graham       Keevil (Archaeological Consultant for Blackburn, Rochester, and Salisbury       Cathedrals, Christ Church, Oxford, and Tewkesbury Abbey) confirms, Blair's       work, notably Church Archaeology: Research Directions for the Future,       of which he is co-editor and part- author, is a standard reference for         diocesan and cathedral archaeologists [2].
His research on canals       has had a similar influence in that area.
He has been a long-term member       of several bodies concerned with the conservation and planning care of       churches and archaeological sites, and has taken a leading role in       working-parties for individual conservation projects.
He has played a       significant role in a great many decisions relating to specific sites and       buildings, as well as in developing and applying high standards and good       practice.
To take one example, his research on the Anglo-Saxon landscape       of the Bampton region in West Oxfordshire has underpinned the conservation       and management policy developed by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and       Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust for the National Nature Reserve at Chimney       Meadows (http://www.bbowt.org.uk/reserves/chimney-meadows).
His active engagement in many fields of conservation is evident in his       membership of public bodies: currently he is a member of the Board of       Trustees of the Marc Fitch Fund, the Oxford Cathedral Fabric Committee,       and the Oxford City and County Archaeological Forum.
He has been a member       of the English Heritage Research Panel, the Advisory Board for Redundant       Churches, and the Oxford Diocesan Advisory Committee.
Policy formation       Blair's research project, People and Places in the Anglo-Saxon         Landscape, which was presented to a large public and professional       audience in the 2013 Ford lectures, has given him an unrivalled insight       into the challenges of how best to manage development-funded archaeology       so that the data it produces is not lost but becomes a national asset for       future generations.
Roger M. Thomas (English Heritage) invited Blair to       speak on this issue to the Annual Conference of the Institute for       Archaeologists in 2013 [ii], and English Heritage have recently       commissioned him to produce a report on this topic.
Its conclusions are       already being fed into the formulation of future policy [3].
As Roger       Thomas states, "[Blair's research] has reinforced the policy case for       development-funded archaeology, demonstrating that the data it has       produced will not simply moulder unread, but has the potential to       transform our picture of the past."
He also points out, "Blair's work on       the archaeology of village development, notably his insight that row       villages are likely to be a post- conquest development, is set to have a       significant impact on the on the application of planning policy in the       future" [4].
Given that Britain's management of development-funded       archaeology is watched with keen interest elsewhere in the world, the       influence of this work is bound to spread far beyond the UK.
Public awareness       Blair's publications on churches and landscapes are extremely popular with       adult education classes, whose participants are regularly inspired by         his research on Oxfordshire to explore their own neighbourhoods with new         eyes.
Blair "speaks on occasion to local audiences, is a valued       contributor to projects such as the recent Historical Atlas of         Oxfordshire, and advises and enables many local historical       activities through, for example, membership of the Council of the       Oxfordshire Record Society and as a Marc Fitch Fund trustee" [5].
His work       on water transport has been a similar inspiration, winning both the Canal       History Book of the Year Prize and the Transport History Book of the Year       Prize in 2009 [iii].
He has worked closely with Channel Four's Time         Team (1998-2009), and has spoken on television and radio, including       such programmes as Tony Robinson's Gods and Monsters (2012) and       Channel 5's Mysteries of the Vampire Skeletons (2011) [iv].
His       books are standard reading on the Anglo-Saxon period all over the world.
