     On the basis of the findings of the research, the Plymouth DAAT developed       new ways of approaching public injecting in the City.
The changes have       included deploying primary care services in hostels, reducing the size of       the standard issues of syringe packs to reduce discards, introducing       injecting bins in new sites and targeting outreach work to new locations.
The DAAT publically stated the changes introduced as a result of the       research to be: `... a really cost effective way of finding out about         the problem in detail and using that detail to bring about effective         changes to policy and practice'.
The research and recommendations       have enabled Plymouth DAAT to better target services and develop policies       that are likely to mitigate rather than increase risks by reducing waste &#8212;       both in terms of discarded equipment and services that are not needed or       inappropriately sited &#8212; and develop partnerships and practices designed to       reduce deaths associated with public injecting.
They have also used the       research to reach out to hidden and at risk populations.
At a local level       it has reduced the harm to public injectors as there is now a better       understanding of the specific local issues that increase risks.
On the basis of this research the NHS Plymouth Public Health Directorate       signed a Memorandum of Agreement with Plymouth University to develop       research, teaching and training and helped secure the post-doctoral       employment of Stephen Parkin (Jan 2010 through to March 2012 when Parkin       left Plymouth) in a newly developed and resourced Drug and Alcohol       Research Unit under the Directorship of Coomber.
DARU was built into the       Memorandum as an explicit area to be supported in a collaborative way.
The       Memorandum commits both organisations to develop Public Health careers and       education pathways, as well as broaden and deepen educational, research       and enterprise.
The Memorandum has led to a range of public health courses       and research opportunities such as degree level modules run by Public       Health.
Dissemination of the results from the first project (in Plymouth)       resulted in greater awareness of public injecting practices and led to two       new (Barking &amp; Dagenham, and Southend-on-Sea) pieces of commissioned       research to focus on those localities.
Change of practice and attitude       towards public injectors and public injecting by local DAATs and other       stakeholders in each of the areas has since been implemented and       evidenced.
In Southend-on-Sea the research has led to similar benefits around       managing the environmental risk and the planning of services and strategy.
The Southend DAAT Manager stated that:     `Instigated by the research and continued post-research was both         better situational monitoring of public toilets by the contractor, and         importantly, installation (via both retro-fitting and at time of build)         of sharps disposals.
Incidences of discards reported to DAAT have fallen         subsequent to this process and there has been no further 'bad press'         such as that immediately prior to us commissioning DARU.'
They also reported improved joint working with agencies in dealing with       the issues and a more joined up approach to injecting including a joint       policy on discards including the non-use of blue lighting unless problems       persisted and then only with a full assessment.
They stated that this       would be `unrealisable without the research and the opportunity for         dialogue it created'.
They stated `by necessity the research         brought some difficult subjects into sharp relief, together with the         often conflicting responses to these.
Joint approaches to such issues is         more routine and relations are palpably improved.'
The research was presented at the National Conference on Injecting Drug       Use (2010) which is a non-academic conference organised by Exchange       Supplies - an established agency set up by drug workers to develop new       products, produce publications and stage conferences.
Attendees include       Nurse specialists, needle exchange support workers and Addiction workers.
The presentations have led to further knowledge and debate on the issue of       public injecting.
By demonstrating that public injecting and the discarding of needles is       not simply the result of thoughtless behaviour the research has enabled       more reflexive policy development to take place that results in less harm       for injecting drug users.
The finding that fluorescent `blue-lights' used       in public toilets does not deter injecting but make it more risky has been       used by each of the DAATs to specifically change policy around how public       injecting and needle distribution and exchange is approached in their       areas.
It has also led to wider debate around the use of blue light.
We       expect more studies to be commissioned and the impact to grow, both       nationally and internationally.
