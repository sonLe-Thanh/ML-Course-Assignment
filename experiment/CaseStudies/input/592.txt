     In developing this area of the law, the English courts have expressly       relied on and adopted the four-part       analytic framework developed over several years by Birks and Burrows, as       well as other particular       aspects of their views.
Their framework has been so widely endorsed by the       courts and used by       counsel that it left a profound mark on the law in this area.
There are       few fields of English law where       the courts have made such pivotal and persistent use of academic research.
Indeed, so entrenched       has the Birks-Burrows approach become, that it is routinely described by       the courts and others as the       standard view of the area.
The research of Birks and Burrows has been favourably cited in scores of       decisions of the courts in       England and Wales (as well as in other `common law' jurisdictions,       including Australia, Canada and       Hong Kong).
In these decisions, the courts gradually shaped a ground of       recovery that was, in English       law, entirely new.
Restitution was known and recognised in the United       States and some other       jurisdictions.
Nonetheless, seeing that there is space for, and a need       for, a kind of legal remedy, is not       sufficient to call it into being.
Someone needs to articulate and       recognise its basic principles, and to       show how these can be integrated with the rest of the law of that       jurisdiction.
In some areas, this is work       for Parliament, but in large fields of common law it falls to the courts.
So it is in the law of unjust       enrichment.
When counsel and the courts sought guidance in developing this       area of law they naturally       looked to other jurisdictions.
But they also looked to the work of legal       researchers, and in England and       Wales, very extensively to the work of Birks and Burrows.
Their arguments       reached the courts by their       frequent citation by academic writers, through the work of counsel who       actively sought out research that       offered guidance that could be useful developing arguments, and by more       than a decade of direct       engagement with the legal profession in seminars at Oxford and elsewhere,       including Professor       Burrows' work in judicial education through the Civil Committee of the       Judicial Studies Board.
In the period 2008-2013, the courts made specific use of the post-1993       publications of Birks and/or       Burrows in many leading cases, including the following:     (i) Arden LJ in Benedetti v Sawiris [2010] EWCA Civ 1427, having       just cited a passage from Burrows       [R2], immediately went on to say `I would add ... at this point       that the writings of scholars are of great       importance in the development of the law of restitution ...I have found       [them] helpful as background in       resolving some of the novel issues on this appeal.'
The case concerned the       question of how one should       value services rendered where there is no binding contract between the       parties.
The decision of the       Court of Appeal was upheld by the Supreme Court (see (v) below) [C1].
(ii) Aikens LJ in Haugesund Kommune v Depfa Bank [2012] 2 WLR 199       had to decide whether the best       interpretation of the law was that one House of Lords decision had been       overruled by another.
Having       cited at [86] Birks' [R4 and R1] he went on in the next paragraph       to reach a conclusion relying on their       analysis [C2].
(iii) In Test Claimants in the FII Group Litigation v HMRC [2012]       2 WLR 1149, which concerned       restitutionary claims for several billions of pounds of overpaid       corporation tax, Lord Walker at [61] cited       Burrows [R3 at 544] as being `generally supportive' of the earlier       case of Phillips-Higgins before going       on to say that, contrary to what he had indicated in a previous case, he       now thought that `Phillips-Higgins       was rightly decided'.
On the separate question of whether one needed a       demand for a       Woolwich claim, his Lordship, at [73], cited Burrows [R2, at       507-8] along with other writers arguing that       a demand was not needed before saying in the next paragraph, `This is a       formidable volume of       distinguished academic opinion' and then going on, at [79], to restate the       law as not needing a demand,       authoritatively settling an important and controversial point of law [C3].
(iv) In Investment Trust Companies v HMRC [2012] EWHC 458 (Ch) at       [38]-[39], which dealt with       restitution of incorrectly charged VAT, Henderson J said the following:       `It has now become conventional       to consider the question whether English law recognises a right to       restitution by reference to the four       questions ... namely:             a) Has the defendant been benefited, in the sense of being enriched?
b) Was the enrichment at the claimant's expense?
c) Was the enrichment unjust?
d) Are there any defences?
As Professor Andrew Burrows QC says in The Law of Restitution,       3rd edition (2011), at p.27, if the first       three questions are answered affirmatively, and the fourth negatively, the       claimant will be entitled to       restitution.
He adds that these four elements "constitute the fundamental       conceptual structure of an       unjust enrichment claim".
While reminding us that this is a framework for       analysis, Henderson J       continued, `I have no quarrel with this basic conceptual structure.
....'       And later at [74], he said, `The next question is whether the enrichment       of HMRC at the expense of the       claimants was unjust.
As Professor Burrows explains in The Law of         Restitution 3rd edition (2011),       chapter 5, the traditional common law approach to this question requires       the claimant to establish the       existence of an "unjust factor" which caused the payment that the claimant       seeks to recover.'
The primary issue in the case was a question on the meaning of `at the       expense of'.
Having looked at       various views, he set out the view of Burrows, saying at [54] that Burrows       occupied `a somewhat       intermediate position' before going on at [67] to decide that that       intermediate position was the correct       approach to apply [C4].
(v) Perhaps most importantly of all, on the appeal to the Supreme Court       in Benedetti v Sawiris [2013]       UKSC 50, Lord Clarke giving the leading judgment relied very extensively       on the work of Burrows.
There are favourable references to Burrows [R2] at [16], [18-20],       [22], [25] and to Burrows [R1] at [28]       and [31-32].
Indeed at [31]-[32], the very detailed examples set out in       Burrows [R1] are repeated and       the conclusions Burrows put forward on their basis are regarded as correct       [C5].
The broad general impact of Birks' research is fairly summarised by a       passage in his obituary in The         Times (July 9, 2004) [C6]: `By now [the late1990s] his work       was inspiring not only other academics but       was also influencing practitioners and judges.
He came to be held in great       esteem by many senior       judges who admired the power of his analysis in pointing the way to a       principled decision.
The respect       afforded to his views reached the point where, in one case, even a mere       footnote in a Birks article       proved to be the subject of several paragraphs of reasoning in the       speeches of the law lords.'
That was       a case in 1996.
But this is not mere background: given the way the common       law works, decisions       reached on the law of unjust enrichment in the period 2008-2013 continue       to rely on prior decisions that       were directly influenced by Birks, as well as on current decisions such as       those detailed above invoking       the work of Burrows.
For example, in Haugesund Kommune v Depfa Bank       [2010] EWCA Civ 579 at       [152] Etherton LJ relied again on the case of Dextra Bank Trust Co Ltd         v Bank of Jamaica [2002] 1 All       ER (Comm) 193 in which the Privy Council said at [45], `Their Lordships       find themselves to be in       agreement with Professor Peter Birks who, in his article [see 4 above on       change of position] at p 49       rejected the adoption of the criterion of relative fault in forthright       language.'
The enormous impact of this research is acknowledged throughout the legal       profession.
A leading QC       says `[T]he work done in this area of law by Professors Birks and Burrows       has been absolutely pivotal,       forming not only the core of the submissions by Counsel as to what the law       is or should be, but       (perhaps more significantly) also underpinning the decisions actually made       by the courts which are, of       course, littered with citations to both Professor Birks' and Professor       Burrows' works'.
[C7] And one of       Britain's most senior judges, now retired, says `Their works made a major       contribution to the       development of the law by the House of Lords judges during this period.'
And `I regarded the       Professors' work as essential and extremely useful background reading when       I was preparing my       judgment in that case.
This is because understanding the structure of the       English law in this field is       extremely important to its future development, and it is important that       the judges get this right when       writing their judgments.
I found the clarity and accessibility of their       exposition of the subject of very       great assistance.
'[C8]     The impact of this research endures; it affects everyone in England and       Wales who might have a claim       in unjust enrichment, or who might have to answer such a claim, and       everything from a phone bill       inadvertently paid twice, to disputes involving millions of pounds in       mistakenly paid tax.
It has       profoundly shaped an entire area of our law.
