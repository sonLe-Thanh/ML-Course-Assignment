     Our research was specifically commissioned to elucidate drivers'       expectations and experiences with EVs in order to inform the UK       Government's strategy for ultra-low emission vehicles in the UK.
The aim       of that strategy is to have a UK car fleet with zero emissions by 2050.
Our research in the BMW international MINI E trial helped to demonstrate       that drivers' expectations and experiences are robust across nations.
Our research in the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) UK trial shows that       those findings are robust across car manufacturers.
Therefore, our       social-psychological research into drivers' use of EVs provides a firm       foundation for government policy makers, car manufacturers, and energy       suppliers seeking to convert EVs from promising prototypes to viable fully       market-ready products.
Findings were disseminated widely to:     Government departments and agencies (Technology Strategy Board, Dept.
for       Transport, Business Innovation and Skills, Dept.
of Energy and Climate       Change, The Office for Low Emission Vehicles)     Car manufacturers (BMW, Mercedes Smart, Tata, Ford, Lightning Car       Company, Westfield Sports Cars, Mitsubishi, Jaguar Land Rover, Toyota,       Microcab, Allied Electric Vehicles, Delta Motorsport, Ecotricity Cars,       Peugeot, Smith Electric Vehicles, Liberty Electric Cars, AVID, Nissan)     Energy suppliers (Scottish and Southern Energy, EDF Energy)     In addition, academic journal articles and conference presentations have       disseminated results to the wider community and the research has been       reported in national media, including BBC News, national newspapers and       automotive websites.
Impact on Policy and Economic Development: Significantly,       the research has shown the UK Government that EVs are a viable proposition       for daily use by private and corporate drivers in the UK today, and have       indicated ways in which usability could be improved further [Refs       1,2,4,5,6].
Mr. Norman Baker, MP, Minister of Transport, said,     "This in-depth study provides important evidence to support the         Government's policy which is set out today in the Ultra-Low Emission         Vehicles Strategy.
People find electric vehicles easy and fun to drive.
In addition, they are less polluting and a vital part of the UK's         transition to a low-carbon sustainable transport system" [a].
Mr. Phil Smith, Chair of the TSB, indicated that,     "The UK is committed to a low-carbon economy, and transport is a key         area where change will be needed.
This study shows how people will         welcome and readily adapt to well- thought-out and effective innovation         in this" [b].
The Head of Low Carbon Regulation, R&amp;D and       Procurement at OLEV said that     "the finding that drivers used their at-home charge points for 97% of         their charging time" led to the OLEV strategy to commit to providing       "a national package of up to &#163;37 million through to May 2015 to support         the installation of charge-points in homes, residential streets, railway         station and public sector car parks and rapid charge-points to         facilitate longer journeys" [c]     As a result of the research, Government is aware that drivers expect EVs       to be priced at comparable levels to normal cars, and to receive further       financial incentives.
This has ramifications for ensuring that EVs are       introduced at an appropriate price (and for the continuation of the EV       purchase supplement), and for follow-on benefits such as congestion charge       waivers [d].
Impact on EV Car Development: The results on drivers' range       requirements, levels of adaptation and driving styles have informed car       manufacturers' decisions regarding the required battery capability of       their EVs, drivers' prior expectations, anticipated mobility needs,       expected vehicle cost, the learning curve of adaptation to EVs, and the       way these vehicles should look relative to normal cars [Refs 1-6].
We had       an especially close relationship with BMW.
The Project Leader (User       Research, BMW) indicated that the unique theoretical underpinnings of the       research enabled BMW to understand the need "to establish a situation         in which fleet car users identified with the green agenda of their         company" in order to achieve optimal adaptation and that "on a         theoretical level, the differentiation between primary and secondary         adaptation resolved a paradox that was not explainable before" and       that "in order to make EVs a success story, customers should be         encouraged to achieve secondary adaptation", making "these         results highly relevant for sales and aftersales processes and long-term         customer satisfaction" [e].
The findings prompted BMW to develop the new position of EV Mobility       Consultant and to construct salesrooms that are specific to EVs.
General       Manager of BMW UK's Project i stated that the research had "been         invaluable in helping our understanding of how people really respond to         electric cars" and that this information puts them in a "strong         position to provide a well-rounded product and service proposition".
Indeed, she also explicitly stated that Harris et al.
's findings "informed         the development of the 2011 BMW ActiveE" and that "the biggest         beneficiary will be the BMW i3, the first purpose-built EV from the BMW         Group, due in 2013" [f].
Impact on Energy Provision: Energy suppliers are       particularly concerned with assessing drivers' ease of use of private and       public charging points and concerned with determining the degree of public       charging infrastructure required to support a new market of EVs.
The Head       of Sustainable Transport at Scottish and Southern Electric has said that       the findings have     "been invaluable for us in forecasting the impact of EV charging on         the network and understanding the underlying behaviours of EV owners         when recharging at home.
This has helped when talking to EV charging         equipment manufacturers in designing charging equipment that is         functional and easy to use.
It has also provided valuable insights into         the utility of public charging infrastructure and the types of locations         that would meet the requirements of future EV owners as the market         develops" [g].
In addition, energy suppliers and consultants are also using the results       on drivers' preferred charging times to inform their development of       charging posts and to increase the predictability of public charging sites       being available for use for mid-journey recharging [Refs 4,6].
These       factors are helping to make further improvements to the provision of       public charging infrastructure that would enhance the experiences of EV       drivers.
