     Context     Lack of urban greenspace can lead to problems such as urban heat islands       and flooding.
Before       this research, most climate prediction models answered very specific       questions and required high       level input.
This research enabled the development of accessible and       easy-to-use tools that       planners can use to design urban greenspace intelligently and has informed       policies on a local,       national and international scale.
The work is at the boundary between scientific research, policy making       and adaptation practice,       bringing together the organisations and people responsible for addressing       the challenges that       climate change will bring.
Pathways to impact            Customised models have been made publically and freely available         online as STAR tools:         Surface Temperature And Runoff tools for assessing the potential of         green infrastructure in         adapting urban areas to climate change.
The site had 610 unique visitors         from 351 different         organisations in the period 1st Feb - 22nd Oct         2012 [text removed for publication] with other         international visitors from Singapore, Germany, Japan and Brazil.
Meeting with stakeholders, seminars and talks across the UK and Europe         by the research team         led to the widespread dissemination of the research.
Reach and significance of the impact     Influencing international planning:            The UMT approach has been adopted in five African cities including         Saint Louis (Senegal),         Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), Dar Es Salaam (Tanzania), Douala (Cameroon) and         Ouagadougou         (Burkina Faso).
In Addis Ababa in particular, the UMT dataset has         already helped the effective         engagement of local stakeholders and is to form the foundation of the         city's new Master Plan         (May 2013).

In terms of the importance of urban vegetation for aesthetics and         biodiversity, Whitford et al [1]         was cited in the proceedings of the Ecocity World Summit 2008 [B].
This         is a cross-disciplinary         World Summit on Sustainable Cities, supported by the non-profit         organisation, Ecocity Builders,         who aim to reshape cities for the long-term health of human and natural         systems.
Ecocity         Builders are a global network that works in partnership with the United         Nations to develop and         implement policies on a global scale.
Informing national policy:            The Forest Research report to the Department for Environment, Food and         Rural Affairs         (DEFRA) and the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG),         titled `Benefits           of green infrastructure' [C] cites data from Whitford et al [1]         and Gill et al [3].
This report         examined how the policy objectives of DEFRA and DCLG could be supported         based on         evaluation of scientific literature.
Whitford et al [1] is cited under         `hydrological benefits' of         greenspace and Gill et al [3] is cited under `heat amelioration' and         `sustainable urban drainage'         as `environmental benefits' of green infrastructure.
Following on from the Forest Research report to DEFRA and the DCLG         [C], the DCLG         produced a National Planning Policy Framework [D].
The 2012 guidance document produced by CIRIA (Construction Industry         Research and         Information Association), `The benefits of large species trees in           urban landscapes' [E], was         influenced by the findings of Gill et al [3] in terms of `costing,         design and management'.
Users of         the guidance document include developers, local authorities, planners,         highways authorities,         landscape architects and arboricultural managers.
Informing the planting practices of community forests:            In collaboration with partners, Community Forests North West, research         regarding optimal         planting conditions for street trees is being widely disseminated to the         arboricultural, planning         and architecture community.

Informing the Manchester Climate Change Action Plan:            Ennos's research has influenced the strategy of local governments in         the North West.
The 2009         Manchester Climate Change Action Plan [I], published by Manchester City         Council, includes         models to show the maximum surface temperature in Greater Manchester         from 1970-2080, with         reference to Gill's PhD thesis.
Research findings were incorporated into the Greater Manchester         Climate Strategy for 2011-2020         [J] under the action `Green and Blue Infrastructure'.
