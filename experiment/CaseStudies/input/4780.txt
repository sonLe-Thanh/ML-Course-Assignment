     Mark Casson's research has made, in the words of the UKTI Director of       Economics and       Evaluation, `an outstanding contribution' to the analysis of the economic       rationale for Government       support for exporting and inward investment [1].
In the 1990s and early 2000s Government policy was to encourage all forms       of inward FDI through       the UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) arm of the then Department for Trade       and Industry (DTI, now       the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, BIS).
The prevailing       view among policy makers       was that the net benefit of inward FDI on the productivity growth of the       indigenous firms (mostly in       the supply chain) was very significant, indeed more significant than the       impact of assisting SMEs to       begin exporting.
The 2004 Spending Review proposed that resources to       increase efforts to attract       inward investors be doubled from 2005 to 2008, but trade support services       for exporters receive an       increase of only 30% [see section 4.10, p. 44 in source 2].
The DTI,       Foreign and Commonwealth       Office and HMT commissioned research from the University of Reading       because of the       international reputation of several economists there in the field of       international business.
Led by       Casson, this grouping was called the Reading Business Group [see Annex 1       `Reading Business       Group', in source 3].
Building on Buckley and Casson's 1998 analysis of foreign market entry       strategies (see section 3       above), the Reading Business Group (James Pemberton, appointed to Reading       in 1984, retired       2011, Simon Burke, appointed to Reading 1989 to the present, Andrew       Godley, appointed 1991 to       present, and Nigel Wadeson, appointed 1997 to present) then produced the       2005 report on the       Design and Analysis of a Survey of UKTIs Trade Development and Inward         Investment Activities       [see Section 3 above].
This report then formed the basis of the DTI       report, Study of the Relative         Economic Benefits of the UK Trade and Investment Support for Trade and         Inward Investment:         Final Synthesis Report, which became known as the `Relative Net       Benefits Study' [3].
This study showed that the previous consensus among policy makers had       both over-estimated the       benefits of inward investment to the UK economy (through failing to       acknowledge both that       subsidiary profit is repatriated and that inward investment might       undermine indigenous intellectual       property rather than add to it) and underestimated the benefits of trade       development (by failing to       acknowledge the impact on SME profitability from increased exports and       underestimating SMEs'       export potential).
This work was followed up by the Evaluation of         Industry Support provided by         UKTI Sectors Group, 2006 [4], which showed that Government support       for trade development was       being targeted on a limited range of sectors, many of which (e.g.
banking)       did not need support.
HMT was initially proposing a radical change in UKTI policy that would       sharply reduce the       proportion of support for SMEs and divert those resources in favour of a       doubling of support for       inward investors.
But the University of Reading research team demonstrated       that in fact this was       based on flawed assumptions.
Instead the University of Reading research       demonstrated that the       net benefits of supporting UK-based SMEs to export and to become embedded       within UK supply       chains were significantly higher than previously believed [3, 4].
These findings were initially seen as controversial.
The initial DTI       report, which drew on the       Reading research, International Trade and Investment &#8212; The Economic         Rationale for Government         Support [5] required additional data gathering by an independent       source.
This source corroborated       the Reading Business Group's findings.
The Reading findings were then       subsequently accepted       and incorporated into UK policy, and the shift of resource to supporting       inward investment was       reversed back in favour of export support.
This can be illustrated from successive UKTI Annual Reports.
In 2005-06       UKTI spending on inward       investment support totaled &#163;27.3m and on trade support &#163;57.1m.
Then, in       UKTI's first significant       response to the 2004 Spending Review target of doubling resources for       inward investment support,       resources for inward investment then increased by almost one-fifth to       &#163;32.1m in 2006-07, while       trade support spending was cut to &#163;51.7m [pp.
10-11 in source 7].
But once       the Reading findings       were accepted, the funding of inward investment support fell from &#163;32.6m       in 2007-08 to &#163;26.2m in       2010-11, whereas the funding for trade support increased from &#163;51.7m in       2006-07 to &#163;57.6m in       2007-08, and increased further to &#163;62.1m in 2010-11 [Fig 17, p. 31 in 8].
A clearer illustration of the impact of the research is when the amounts       of funding are depicted in       relative shares of the total UKTI funding for trade and inward investment       support.
In 2005-06 the       relative shares of trade support and inward investment support were 68%       and 32%.
In 2006-07,       when the 2004 Spending Review targets first significantly influenced       spending decisions, those       shares changed to a fall to 62% in the share of UKTI funding for trade       support and a rise to 38%       for inward investment support.
After the Reading Business Group's findings       had been accepted       and policy was reversed back to favour trade support, the relative shares       changed.
First a slight       change in 2007-08, when trade support received 64% and inward investment       36%, then more       clearly by 2010-11, with trade support receiving 70% and inward investment       support 30% of the       total.
The latest UKTI Annual Report confirms that this continues,       with 75% of funding going to       trade support and only 25% to inward investment support activities [see       p.8 in source 9].
The UKTI Director of Economics and Evaluation confirms that the       `analytical work did indeed play a       crucial role in shifting the policy attitude in Government towards greater       recognition of the validity       of the economic rationale for this [trade] support'.
As a result of this       work by Mark Casson and the       team at the University of Reading, UKTI practice was changed in 2007 and       measures to attract FDI       became far more selective, notably focusing on the potential to benefit       UK-based firms in the       supply chains of the proposed inward investments.
In addition, successive       adaptations since 2008       have reversed the earlier UKTI (and HMT) prioritisation of supporting       inward FDI and instead UKTI       now devotes a greater share of its resources to supporting SME exporters       than was envisaged in       2007 [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
In sum, this research has had a major impact on UK Government policy       since 2007.
Its direct       beneficiaries include UKTI, BIS, and HMT.
Its indirect beneficiaries       include UK-based SMEs that       benefited from UKTI support to become part of inward investors' supply       chains.
