     The University of Oxford's research showing artemisinin and ACT to be the       superior treatment for malaria in both children and adults, led the World       Health Organization (WHO) to recommend ACT as the preferred antimalarial       in 20067.
As a result, this research has led directly to the       successful cure of millions of malaria sufferers worldwide.
Since 2000 an increasing number of countries in which malaria is endemic       have adopted ACT in the treatment of malaria, with the number of ACT       treatment courses surging from 500,000 in 2001 to 31.3 million in 20058       - more than 80% of these orders were placed through the WHO8.
This number increased to 76 million in 2006 and reached 158 million people       in 20099.
By the end of 2009, 11 African countries had provided       sufficient courses of ACT to cover more than 100% of malaria cases seen in       the public sector, while a further 8 African countries delivered enough       courses to treat between 50-100% of cases9.
In 2008, 78 countries reported a policy of treatment with ACT for malaria10.
In 2009, of the 108 countries in which malaria is endemic, 77 were using       ACT for the treatment of malaria and 52 were offering ACT free of charge       in the public sector for children under 5 years10.
Due to the       availability of ACT along with other malarial control measures, such as       insecticide-treated nets and indoor-residual spraying, there has been a       50% reduction in confirmed malaria cases and malaria caused deaths in 13       African nations11.
WHO guidelines recommending the use of ACT7 along with other       control measures, such as insecticide-treated nets and indoor-residual       spraying, effectively saved the lives of 736,700 children in 34 African       countries between 2001 and 201012.
A recent news release       circulated by the WHO on World Malaria Day 2012, showed that the number of       ACT courses distributed worldwide by government health departments had       "increased exponentially", from 11 million in 2005 to 181 million in 2010.
Along with long-lasting insecticidal nets, sprays, and better diagnostic       tests, this increased coverage has led to more than 1 million lives saved       over the past 10 years13.
