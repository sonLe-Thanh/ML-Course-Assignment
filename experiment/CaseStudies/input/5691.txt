     Empyema is a complication of pneumonia which causes significant       morbidity, with prolonged hospitalisations and multiple invasive       procedures.
The incidence of paediatric empyema has risen dramatically       over the last decade, both in the UK and around the world [a].
Prior to the research described above, significant variance in the       management of paediatric empyema existed.
Treatment was dependent on       institutional and practitioner preference, with concern over both the       state of the evidence base and a lack of standardised practice.
This was       acknowledged in the British Thoracic Society Guidelines for the Management       of Pleural Infection in Children (2005) which said that "in the UK         there is little consensus over management among respiratory         paediatricians and thoracic surgeons" [b].
Through the demonstration by Sonnappa and Jaffe of clinical equivalence       between chest drain insertion with fibrinolytic instillation and       video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, a clinical consensus favouring the       former has emerged.
Supported by subsequent randomised trials in the US,       chest drain use is now established in international guidelines as       first-line management of empyema.
Furthermore, it is now widely accepted       that routine CT chest scanning should not be performed in the management       of children with empyema, thus reducing exposure to harmful radiation.
Impact on international guidelines     The Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand reference our studies       in their recommendations on: the use of daily X-rays, drainage of pleural       fluid and use of VQ scans [c].
Clinical practice guidelines issued       by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases       Society of America on the management of community-acquired pneumonia in       infants and children, referencing both our study and the subsequent US       study, recommend: "Both chest thoracostomy tube drainage with the         addition of fibrinolytic agents and VATS have been demonstrated to be         effective methods of treatment.
The choice of drainage procedure depends         on local expertise" [d].
The Canadian Paediatric Society       also refers to our research in their guidelines which state that "Although         there is still ongoing controversy and a need for additional randomized         trials, the best evidence suggests that either VATS, early thoracotomy         or small-bore percutaneous chest tube placement with instillation of         fibrinolytics (CTWF) results in the best outcomes as measured by         hospital length of stay.
CTWF may be the most cost-effective choice"       [e].
Impact on hospital practice     Many hospitals in the UK and abroad have adopted our research finding in       drafting their local guidelines for managing empyema in children.
Guidelines from United Bristol Healthcare NHS Trust state that "Video-assisted         thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) may be an appropriate alternative to         thoracotomy.
Early VATS, as a primary procedure, does not appear to         offer benefit over a chest drain and urokinase, but is routinely used in         some centres and in the US" [f].
Furthermore, guidelines from the Children's Mercy City Hospital in       Kansas, USA recommend that "Utilization of VATS or chest tube with         fibrinolytic agents have been shown to decrease morbidity compared to         chest tube alone with evidence suggests that treatment with VATS or         chest tube plus fibrinolysis decreases the duration of fever and         hospital length of stay" [g].
Our study is also referenced in the Children's Health Clinical Guideline       for Empyema provided by Auckland City Hospital, New Zealand [h].
Benefits to patients     This shift in practice has reduced exposure to the potential harms of       general anaesthesia and invasive surgery along with the associated       psychological stress to both paediatric patients and their parents/carers.
Furthermore, the use of CT scans itself carries significant morbidity.
Various studies have indicated an increased risk of cancer developing       later in life for those who have undergone CT scanning.
An Australian       study, published in 2013, found that cancer incidence was increased by 24%       in patients exposed to a CT scan when aged 0-19 years, compared with the       incidence in the unexposed [i].
Thus our demonstration that       routine CT scanning is clinically unnecessary means that through the use       of plain chest X-rays and ultrasound scans for confirming a diagnosis of       empyema, children are exposed to much lower doses of ionising radiation,       reducing the risk of future malignancies.
Economic benefits     A 2008 US study used our data as the basis for their estimations of       cost-effectiveness and concluded that "On the basis of the best         available data, chest tube with instillation of fibrinolytics is the         most cost-effective strategy for treating pediatric empyema" [j].
