     The impact of Altunba&#351;' research on the formulation of public policy in       the banking sector developed over 2008-2013 and was facilitated by the       involvement of user groups from the outset.
Specifically, Altunba&#351; acted       as a consultant and collaborative researcher at a number of central banks       and official international financial institutions, including the Bank of       Italy (2007), European Central Bank (2008-2013) [b1], Bank for       International Settlements (2011) [b2] and the Central Bank of       Turkey (2012).
These engagements meant that Altunba&#351;' research was able to       influence quickly the global policy debate on securitisation and monetary       policy over the REF 2014 assessment period.
Research findings were disseminated through presentations to monetary       policymakers at the highest level including: the Executive Board and       Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) (Frankfurt, March       2009, June 2009, September 2009, and October 2009); and the Board of the       Bank for International Settlements (BIS) (Basel, September 2009).
The same       research has been debated with and by staff at central banks in workshops       held at the ECB (April, 2009, June 2009), the Bank of England (December,       2011), the Korean Central Bank &#8212; BIS/IMF Conference (April 2012), and the       Central Bank of Turkey (June, 2013).
The main pathway to impact was using these presentations and       collaborations to influence public sector policy concerning bank       securitisation and its influence on monetary policy.
The importance of       Altunba&#351;' research became evident as central banks and global financial       organizations grappled with the unintended consequences of financial       innovation following the banking crisis of 2007.
The results of his       research then gained the attention of, and were showcased as a key       priority for national central banks by the influential Committee on the       Global Financial System (CGFS) (based at the Bank for International       Settlements in Basel, which monitors developments in global financial       markets for central bank Governors) [b3] as well as the Basel       Committee on Banking Supervision [b4 and b5] and in ECB       Monthly Bulletins (March and October, 2009).
The importance of       understanding Altunba&#351;' risk taking channel in monetary policy was also       highlighted by policy work by staff at the International Monetary Fund       (IMF) [b6].
Evidence of Altunba&#351;' impact is, therefore, the use of his research to       support changes in priorities for the public policy debate on monetary       policy and the supervision of banking activities by focusing attention on       the "risk-taking channel" of monetary policy as a key field of study.
Further evidence of the impact and influence on monetary policy and the       policy debate on bank supervision of Altunba&#351;' research is found in       extensive references to it by leading policymakers, including the:             President of the European Central Bank, in delivering the Susan           Bies Lecture (Kellogg Distinguished Lecture Series) entitled "What         can central banks do in a financial crisis?
", Evanston, Illinois (27         April 2010), stated:         "Literature on the so-called "risk-taking channel" of monetary policy           transmission provides a deeper insight into such behaviour; see (inter           alia): ... (reference to [a4])" [b7]        Governor of the Bank of France and Chairman of the Board of           Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the         conference The future of Monetary Policy, Rome (1 October 2010),         stated:         "Simply put, very low interest rates may create incentives for banks           to take on more risks.
Recent research has provided empirical           evidence compatible with such a notion.
It has been documented [in         [a5]], for example, how market based measures of bank's risks           as perceived by financial market participants tend to react positively           to changes in interest rates, so that a lower interest rate leads           investor to perceive banks as less risky.
..." [b8]        President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Konstanz Seminar         on Monetary Theory and Policy, Island of Reichenau, (28 May 2009)         stated:         "As concerns the bank lending channel, a number of studies document           that financial innovation &#8212; such as securitisation or credit           derivatives &#8212; have led to banks becoming more flexible in reacting to           monetary policy.
More specifically, they may have become able to           better isolate their loan costumers from restrictive monetary policy           impulses (reference to [a3])."
[b9]        Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, in a speech entitled         "After the crisis &#8212; new thoughts on monetary policy" delivered at Nordea         (one of the four big banks in Sweden and the Baltic Region), Stockholm         (6 December 2010), stated:         "There is as yet rather limited empirical research on the risk-taking           channel, but some papers on the subject have now begun to appear.
The           studies are based on data from the eurozone and the United States, as           well as other countries.
They appear on the whole to support the           theory that low policy rates lead to the banks taking greater risks         (reference to [a5])".
