     Broadbent and Laughlin's theoretical model for PAs has influenced       auditing practice in the UK, and more recently has been incorporated into       models of practice in Australia.
The model derived from the CIMA-funded research project and first       incorporated into the UK National Audit Office's Framework for Evaluation       in 2006.
The influence was evidenced by a quotation from the former       Comptroller and Auditor General Sir John Bourne in his book Public Sector       Auditing (source 2, p. 73):     `I use the terms effectiveness audit and evaluation interchangeably as         in essence they are broadly the same.
Particularly with what has come to         be known as `dialogic evaluation'.
Indeed Richard Laughlin, Jane         Broadbent and Jas Gill in their research on evaluating PFI deals         highlight the close similarities in approaches adopted by evaluators and         V-F-M auditors.'
Two key publications by the NAO (source 3) were informed by `dialogic       evaluation'.
NAO's development of these ideas began in 2003 when they       called together a group of experts, including Broadbent and Laughlin to       advise them in their development of a model to deal with the complexity of       evaluating PFI/PPPs.
This same model formed the foundations of the PA evaluation model adopted       by the Victorian Auditor General's Office (VAGO) in Australia in 2009.
The findings of the ARC-funded project were fed into VAGO following       extensive dialogue and meetings, especially with the Auditor-General and       VAGO senior staff.
A key part of this interaction with these end users       concerned the theoretical model for the PA of the operational stage of       PPPs.
In a letter dated 25 March 2009 (source 4) the Auditor-General wrote       to the individual members of the research team:     "Your research efforts, the many stimulating conversations that they         generated by the team's work, and the final paper that you provided in         December 2008, are appreciated and will assist our future endeavours in         this important area."
The Auditor-General was sufficiently impressed with the insights that he       was keen to implement these in VAGO and that the best practice should be       disseminated and adopted by other Auditor- Generals in other Australian       States.
This perspective is also apparent in the supporting letter, dated       25 March 2009 (source 4):     "Due to the recent endorsement of the National Public Private         Partnership Policy and Guidelines by the Council of Australian         Governments, I intend to refer the research outputs to the Australasian         Council of Auditors General for further comment and action."
The wider resonation of the ideas and their importance with the       Auditor-General of VAGO is illustrated further in a later letter to       Associate Professor Linda English on 28 September 2010 (source 5) where he       explains how a performance audit report (source 6) tabled before       Parliament on 15 September 2010, which focussed on the operational stage       of four prisons across Victoria, found that an on-going challenge for the       public sector is the delivery of anticipated v-f-m proposition over the       life of these long-term contracts.
The PA helped to identify weaknesses in       the operational stages of prison PPPs and subsequently led to:     "The Department of Justice acknowledged that as a result of this         audit, it has initiated changes to its contract management and         administration of prison PPPs.
The Department of Treasury and Finance         (DTF) is re-examining the extent to which it provides guidance and         support to agencies managing PPPs..."     The further dissemination of the ideas, and greater impact of the ideas       upon a wider set of end users beyond Victoria, specifically with regard to       the operational stage of PPPs, is clearly stated in a paper written by the       Former Auditor-General of Australia (source 7, commenting on source 8),       where he pointed out:     `The evaluation and audit of PPPs have received little attention in         the literature in recent years, particularly in any analytical way, in         my opinion.
The article is a very worthwhile contribution in drawing         attention to the issues associated with assessing the longer term         efficiency and effectiveness of PPPs particularly in a changing         environment.
It should encourage more thoughtful analysis and         development by all those involved, not least from audit offices.
In         particular, there is a need to focus on assessments of Value for Money         over long periods of time as results are actually achieved.'
