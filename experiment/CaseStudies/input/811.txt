     Context: The global food industry is the world's largest industry       (the UK sector alone is worth       &#163;189bn), land- and water-user and polluter.
Demand for food is increasing       rapidly and there is little       ability, globally, to use more land or water.
At the same time there is       growing recognition that any       increase in production needs to conserve ecological function.
Thus, across       the world, the policy       focus on "sustainable intensification" is intense: how can we grow more on       the same land whilst       reducing environmental harm?
Our work is viewed as a "thought leader",       influencing thinking in       policy, industry and public, by indicating that allowing land to       specialise appropriately in producing       food or ecosystem services can produce more of both than a "one size fits       all" approach of       managing everywhere to produce both simultaneously, and that concentration       should be on       delivering sustainable landscapes rather than sustainable agriculture per         se.
Appointment to high profile position: Benton has prosecuted the       translation of the scientific       advances (section 2) to policy-makers in government (UK, EU, G-20), to the       public and to decision-       makers throughout the food industry.
The translation of this work to       society arose, originally, from       strategic investment of his time supported by Leeds specifically to       promote the impact of this body       of work (refs 1-3).
The profile generated was contributory to the       appointment of Benton to the post       of UK Global Food Security Champion in 2011 (0.8 fte for 5 years) [A].
This post involves the       coordination of research spend in food security across the UK's public       funders, the provision of       evidence to government, and the translation of the evidence to wider       society (industry and the       public).
Dissemination strategy: A deliberative dissemination strategy has       helped generate impact       beyond academia.
An original press release was followed by publications in       a range of       stakeholder-facing outlets including journals (Benton et         al.
World Agriculture 2: 14-21 2011),       magazines (Benton TG (2012) Sustainable intensification and       the UK.
In Food Ethics Council       magazine special edition on "Sustainable intensification:       unravelling the rhetoric", Jul 12 2012) and       blogs (e.g.
Seeds, feed, food Jan 2012; Plantwise:       Mar 2012 GFS: on the meaning of         sustainability: June 2012; Landscapes for people, food and         nature: Resilient landscapes June       2013).
These pieces have raised the work's profile and led to invitations       to speak or advise as       detailed below.
Influence on UK government: Parliamentary impact has been       delivered within select       committees, within government departments (e.g.
DEFRA) and through Benton's       appointment as       the Global Food Security Champion by the UK government [A].
In the House of Commons Select Committee report &#8212; Environmental, Food         &amp; Rural Affairs         Committee: Greening the common agricultural policy [B], there         are references to oral (pages         Ev11-Ev15) and written submissions (pages Ev90-Ev94) from Benton,         and to discussion of         the issues raised by Benton (paragraph 26, page 14; paragraph         64, page 24).
In July 2012, DEFRA published its Green Food Project, which acts as a         framework for         developing agri-environment policy up to mid-century.
Benton was         invited onto the         "Synthesis Group" for his expertise on sustainable landscape management         (1-3), and         paragraphs 4.37-4.41 of the report discuss the need for landscape-level         approaches and         stem from appreciation of this work [C].
A commitment from the         Green Food Project is to         invest in Farm Platforms to allow investigation of the landscape-level         responses around the         UK (a direct outcome from the corpus of work represented here).
DEFRA         has announced an         initial &#163;4.5m of funding to support this (and Benton has         contributed to the design of the call).
Influence on UK Food Industry: Benton has informed stakeholder       groups in the agricultural       sector of the scientific evidence for redefining sustainable food       production in the UK.
This has been       through discussion with high-level industry groups, and the publication of       articles widely read by       trade, plenary addresses at trade conferences [D, E] and detailed       consultancy work the output of       which was published [F].
Influence on farmers.
Benton presented to the National         Farmers' Union and many other         farming conferences and meetings, and has subsequently contributed to a         range of         debates in public and press.
The work by Benton has been         favourably received by the         NFU and the NGO "Linking environment and farming".
Following publication         of the original         research, Benton was recruited to advise the Soil Association's         Duchy Original's Future         Farming programme aiming to improve organic farming methodologies and         this includes         providing printed advice on conducting experiments to 50,000 UK farmers         as a poster         supplied with the NFU's British Farmer and Grower [D].
Benton presented to the Food and Drink Federation alongside the         Secretary of State for         the Environment in May 2012.
Subsequently he was invited to discuss         sustainability with         the Institute of Grocery Distributors' "Sustainability Group" (Dec 2012         and March 2013), and         their Chief Executives' Group (2013).
The Institute of Grocery         Distributors comprises the         30 leading food supply and retail companies in the UK.
This work has led         to re-assessment         of the food industry's sustainability strategies e.g.
Mack Multiples         (&#163;200m turnover fresh         produce supplier) is "greatly benefitting" from Benton's input         in its developing sustainability         strategy and has subsequently employed a Benton group postdoc on         a 6 month contract to         operationalise the work [E].
Consultancy work for the US-based RESOLVE (US based organisation         specialising in         informing public policy, funded by Mars Inc and charitable foundations),         which         commissioned a review of the efficacy of certification schemes in         driving sustainability         benefits.
This review is acknowledged in their final report (see note on         pA-125) and the         review was subsequently published as a working paper of the National         Resource Institute         with a quote from Forum for the Future on its insights [F].
International Influence: Benton has sought to influence the global       sustainability agenda through       both public and private policy fora:            Common Agricultural Policy.
The Common Agricultural Policy         (responsible for 30-40% of         the EU's budget) is currently undergoing reform, and is being finalised         for the next 7 year         spending cycle in summer 2013.
Benton was asked to provide         advice on "sustainability" in         the following ways: (a) invited presentation at the Directorate-General         Environment (to the         Deputy Head of Agriculture, Forests and Soils, and team) (Dec 2010), (b)         presentation in         the EU Parliament (Dec 2010) to a mixture of MEPs and industry, (c)         subsequently, the         Chair of the EU's Agriculture Committee invited Benton to write         a policy paper published in         a journal edited by him, published in 2012 [G].
As Champion for the UK's Global Food Security programme, Benton         is frequently invited to         fora where he can advise on the sustainability and production agendas.
For example he         presented at a side meeting at the Rio+20 conference in June 2012 on         assessing         sustainability; he led the official UK delegation to a G20 meeting of         agricultural chief         scientists in Mexico, Sept 2012, and attended G8 meetings on data         sharing for sustainable         agriculture.
The impact he made at the G8 meeting was to move the         arguments on from         sharing genetic data to sharing environmental data to allow         landscape-level optimisation,         as exemplified by ref (3) [H].
Influencing public choices       Benton has delivered many public lectures on sustainability,       written blogs, contributed to panel       events and has advised the author of the book "A greedy man in a hungry       world" (Spring 2013).
The author recently said publically, and this is echoed in the       acknowledgements in his book, that       Benton's work on sustainability completely reshaped his views and       his book [I].
