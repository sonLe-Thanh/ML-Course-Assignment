     Attempts to use automated formal verification in industrial-scale       examples go back several       decades, the motivation being that bringing verification into the software       engineering process       should ultimately replace most or all testing, create more reliable       systems, and save       both costs and time.
This has proved a more challenging activity than was       first hoped, though       improvements both in verification technology such as model checkers (tools       which explore a       system's reachable states and report any errors found) and the computers       available for running       this technology are now enabling real progress.
The path to impact began with Guy Broadfoot's learning UoA       research on his SEP MSc and       formulating a plan to use it.
After Hopcroft in the UoA researched and       developed this idea with him       [1], the path continued in 2004 when Broadfoot and a business partner set       up Verum to develop       this research into a product now known as Analytical Software Design       (ASD).
The company's goal       was to convert the theoretical principles into a commercial system that       could mathematically verify       all possible outcomes during software design, and go on to automatically       generate defect-free       code.
In turn that would save money, cut development time, and improve       accuracy&#8212;attractive to       businesses because software consumes over 50% of the development costs of       technological       products, and of that more than 40% is spent on testing and defect       removal.
[A]     The impact since 2008 is represented by Verum's product:       ASD:Suite, released in 2009, and by       this product's impact on other organisations as detailed below     ASD:Suite is a design automation tool that combines industrial       model-driven design with       automated formal verification and code generation.
In simple terms,       developers use the high level       ASD language to develop models which represent embedded systems as       networks of state       machines that are linked hierarchically; the network of components are       wired together       automatically to reflect the semantics of the runtime code generated.
Verum has received US,       European and Hong Kong patents for ASD.
The verification technology central to ASD:Suite is completely based on       the UoA research set out       above.
The models are automatically translated into the process algebra       CSP, enabling properties       such as well-formedness of the original specification, deadlock and       livelock freedom, correctness       with respect to the specification, and responsiveness to be automatically       verified or refuted using       the model checker FDR.
Once verification is complete, semantically       equivalent source program       code is automatically generated, in any one of a number of commercial       software languages.
Crucially, because the software system translates the state machines into       CSP and the verified       code is automatically generated, clients never have to interact with       either CSP or FDR, but can       take advantage of their power to test the design models automatically.
Broadfoot (CTO at Verum)       writes (to Bill Roscoe) as follows [F]:     "The ability to express a sufficiently broad class of systems and the         necessary correctness         properties, as well as our ability to push the boundaries of scalability         in practice have resulted from         your research, including the abstraction operations, compression and         chase functions, and         advanced specification techniques based for example on one-to-many         renaming.
We see our         continued involvement with the on-going development of FDR and your         development of new         CSP/FDR techniques for us as vital to the successful creation and         ongoing advances of our         ASD:Suite product."
Verum sells licenses to use ASD:Suite, in which models developed by       clients' engineers are       processed and verified on servers operated by Verum.
Between 2009 and       2013, ASD:Suite's users       have included Philips Medical Systems, Ericsson, electron microscopy       company FEI, and       lithography systems firm ASML.
The benefits of using ASD are reduced cost,       reduced time-to-market,       and improved accuracy.
These have been demonstrated practically by its       clients:            FEI has reported a 4x reduction in cost per line of code [B].
Ericsson has produced essentially error free software, with a         sevenfold increase in         productivity and up to 50% cost saving over conventional software         development         techniques.
They also report being able to use only `three or four         people' when using         Verum, rather than the 20 that would have been needed previously [B, G].
Ard-Jan         Moerdijk, manager of the Dutch subsidiary of Ericsson         Telecommunications, says that         Verum's work is `faultless' and T-Mobile and other of Ericsson's clients         have not come         across a single error in the programs created using Verum's package [G].
The Technical University of Eindhoven has shown that use of the         ASD:Suite at Philips         Healthcare led to a 10x decrease in software defects [C].
Initially set up with funding supplied by the founders, in 2010 Verum       secured an additional &#8364;1.5M       to continue developing ASD [D].
In 2012 Verum was ranked 5th in the SMB       (MKB) Innovation Top       100 in the Netherlands, being labelled the most innovative ICT technology       company in the country       [E].
In the period July 2009 &#8212; July 2013, ASD:Suite was used to create       more than 250 million lines       executable lines of code in the languages C, C++, C#, and Java [F], with       individual generated       systems frequently being over 500,000 lines of code.
All of the models       from which this code was       generated had been verified on FDR.
Each month in January &#8212; July 2013,       ASD:Suite had on       average over 74 active users.
In July 2013, Verum had a workforce of 23       people.
While there have been many impressive applications of formal verification       technology by       verification experts, and a few generally usable applications for       extremely restricted applications,       such as Microsoft's SLAM applied to device driver compliance, we are not       aware of any other       application which, like ASD:Suite, has made verification of a very wide       range of software       accessible to software engineers who are not verification experts.
