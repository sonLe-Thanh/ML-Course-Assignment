     LSHTM's research into the effects of male circumcision as a strategy for       HIV prevention, as well as the prevention of other STIs, has been widely       used to underpin international policy recommendations on male       circumcision, in particular for sub-Saharan Africa.
Its key contribution       was to use systematic reviews, meta-analyses and modelling to draw clear       conclusions from a wide body of research.
In March 2007, WHO/UNAIDS convened a pivotal meeting bringing together       stakeholders, policy- makers and researchers.
Weiss and Hayes presented a       meta-analysis of the three trials, providing a point estimate that       underscored the strength of the evidence and underpinned the document       issued by the meeting recommending male circumcision as an HIV prevention       strategy in combination with other methods like condom promotion.5.1       This key document laid the foundations for subsequent guidelines and       policy statements published after January 2008 and may be found       at www.malecircumcision.org.
In 2008, WHO/UNAIDS' operational guidance for countries wishing to scale       up male circumcision for HIV prevention cited the research conducted by       Weiss and colleagues as evidence of a strong link between male       circumcision and reduced HIV prevalence, as well as evidence of male       circumcision providing protection against ulcerative STIs and penile       cancer.5.2 In the same year, the US Centers for Disease Control       and Prevention (CDC) made reference to the research in a paper laying out       the implications of the findings on male circumcision for the USA.5.3       In August 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics published new       guidelines for infant male circumcision in the US (see http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2012/08/22/peds.2012-1990),       which also cited the underpinning research.
In June 2009, Weiss chaired the first session of an international       consultation convened by WHO and UNAIDS on male circumcision and HIV       prevention, which focused on how to scale up male circumcision services in       sub-Saharan Africa following the March 2007 WHO/UNAIDS recommendation.5.4     The UNAIDS/WHO/SACEMA expert group (including White and Weiss) on       modelling the impact and cost of male circumcision for HIV prevention       published a consensus statement aimed at policy-makers in September 2009,       building on earlier research including that by White and colleagues.3.5       This work helped estimate the number of circumcisions needed for maximum       impact, and the costs of scale-up.5.5 The paper cites our work,3.2,         3,3.
3.4, 3.5 and Hankins and colleagues show that an investment       of US$1.5bn between 2011 and 2015 could achieve 80% coverage in 13       priority countries in southern and eastern Africa and would avert 3.4m new       HIV infections, resulting in net savings of US$16.5bn.
In November 2011,       WHO/UNAIDS published a joint strategic five- year action framework to       accelerate the scale-up of voluntary medical male circumcision for HIV       prevention in eastern and southern Africa.5.6 Intended for use       by country, regional and global stakeholders, this highlights the       consensus modelling paper3.5 demonstrating the cost       effectiveness of medical male circumcision.
The Framework set a goal of       circumcising 80% of males (20m circumcisions) in 14 priority countries by       2015, and an additional 8.4m circumcisions between 2016 and 2025.5.6       The most recent data available from WHO is to the end of 2011, by which       time an estimated 1.4m male circumcisions had been conducted since the       beginning of 2008 in the priority countries.5.7     As a direct result of her research expertise, Weiss serves on the WHO       Technical Advisory Group on Innovations In Male Circumcision.
Following a       meeting in January 2012, in which Weiss participated, the Group       recommended the use of an elastic ring-controlled radial compression       device for adult male circumcision in preference to traditional surgery       (March 2012).5.8     Also as a direct result of her research, Weiss has frequently attended       other WHO/UNAIDS meetings to present research findings and discuss policy       issues.
She and members of LSHTM were commissioned by WHO to conduct       several further systematic reviews as input to their policy deliberations       (e.g.
on male circumcision and the risk of HIV infection in women, 2009),5.9       presented at a meeting on implications of the research findings for women       in Nairobi in June 2008; and provided model projections on combining       microbiocide and male circumcision interventions in rural Uganda (2011).5.10     Weiss has raised the profile of male circumcision for HIV prevention in       public discourse in the UK through appearances in the media.
In August       2008, she discussed the impact of male circumcision on their female       partners on Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4.
In July 2011, she       appeared on The Health Show on BBC World News to discuss the new       device for bloodless circumcision mentioned above.
