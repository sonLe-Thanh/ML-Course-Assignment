     The impact of the research results from the fact that court rulings in       Germany followed legal arguments which Dr Christian Heitsch, Lecturer in       Law, Brunel Law School had developed in two journal articles, one of which       (Rechtsnatur der Akkreditierungsentscheidungen / Prozessuale Fragen,       2009) was finished during the author's tenure at Brunel.

Reference to the Constitutional Court       In its order of 16th April 2010, docket no.
12 K 2689708 [available at http://openjur.de/u/144211.html       (accessed 28/08/2013)], the Arnsberg Administrative Court       (Verwaltungsgericht Arnsberg) made a reference to the Constitutional Court       as to whether the Act establishing the accreditation system is compatible       with the Basic Law.
In its opinion, the Administrative Court cited both       articles.
It used Heitsch's 2007 article as the main authority for the       proposition that the duty to have degree programmes accredited constitutes       an interference with the constitutional right to academic freedom (Ibid.,       at [72]).
In addition, the Court used Heitsch's 2009 article as the main authority       for the proposition that decisions taken by the accreditation agencies are       public law rather than private law matters (Ibid., at[100], [120], [129]).
The Constitutional Court is expected to render its decision in 2013       (Docket no.
1 BvL 8/10, pending, http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/organisation/erledigungen_2013.html       , accessed 28/08/2013).
2.
Litigation about the proper avenue of judicial recourse       Heitsch's 2009 article has also been cited in court rulings made in the       course of litigation about which avenue of judicial recourse is the proper       one for disputes relating to the accreditation of degree programmes.
More       specifically, in its order of 13th November 2009, docket no.
15 E 1158/09       [available at http://openjur.de/u/139909.print       (accessed 13/06/2012)], the Administrative Court of Appeal for the       State of North-Rhine-Westphalia (Oberverwaltungsgericht Nordrhein-       Westfalen) reversed a decision rendered by the Minden Administrative Court       (Verwaltungsgericht Minden) on 30th July 2009, docket no.
2 K 1291/08       [available at http://openjur.de/u/140842.print       (accessed 13/06/2012).
The Administrative Court had ruled that the pending dispute about a       refusal to confer an unconditional accreditation on a degree programme was       a private law matter to be heard by the civil judiciary.
Reversing this       decision, the Administrative Court of Appeal held that the dispute was a       public law matter, and was for the Administrative Judiciary to decide.
In       its reasoning, the Administrative Court of Appeal cited Heitsch's 2009       article as main authority for the proposition that decisions taken by the       accreditation agencies are public rather than private law matters       (Administrative Court of Appeal for the State of North-Rhine-Westphalia,       order of 13th November 2009, at [10 - 11]).

Further evidence of Heitsch's standing with the German judiciary In       its order of 19th November 2008, docket no.
12 L 576/08, para.
20 (available at  http://openjur.de/u/134585.html, accessed 28/08/2013),       Arnsberg Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgericht Arnsberg) rejected a       petition from a German academic institution for an interim injunction to       order the provisional accreditation of a degree programme.
A German court       may only grant an interim injunction after it has made a finding that that       the pending principal action has good prospects of success.
The Arnsberg       Court felt unable to make such a finding in the accreditation case,       because in the judges' view the case raised a wide range of difficult       procedural and substantive issues which could not be meaningfully       addressed in the context of a proceeding for interim relief.
The Court       cited Heitsch's 2007 article to illustrate the relevant legal issues       (ibid.
at [20])     4.
Significance and Reach of Impact       Heitsch's 2007 article was the first thorough investigation into whether       the requirement for accreditation of degree programmes interferes with the       fundamental right to academic freedom and whether decisions taken by       accreditation agencies are public or private law matters.
Similarly, his       2009 article was the first proper study of the various procedural and       substantive issues relating to judicial review of decisions relating to       the accreditation of degree programmes.
True, there had been two previous       journal articles about the new accreditation system (Pautsch, [2005]       Wissenschaftsrecht 210; Lege, [2005] Juristenzeitung 698).The Pautsch       article dealt with the practicalities of the accreditation system from a       university administrator's perspective, took the assertion that       accreditation was a private law matter at face value, and only in passing       addressed the doctrinal issues.
The Lege article was more of a polemic       rather than a thorough legal investigation.
Apart from the impact that Heitsch's research had on the development of       judicial doctrine, it also will almost certainly lead to significant cost       savings for academic institutions.
This is because, until recently, the       accreditation agencies firmly believed that they were acting on a private       law basis and that they were entitled to review applications for       accreditation and the supporting multi-hundred- page paperwork very       intrusively.
This manner of second-guessing the higher education       institutions' documentation has significantly distracted academic staff       from their core tasks of teaching and research.
As was criticized by State Courts of Auditors, the way the accreditation       agencies fulfil their task has also led to costs of several million Euros       per year just for the accreditation of degree programmes (see, e.g.,       Supreme Court of Auditors for the Free State of Bavaria, Annual Report       2012, Ch.
17, available at http://www.orh.bayern.de/berichte/jahresberichte/aktuell/jahresbericht-2012/wirtschaftlichkeit/723-tnr-17-akkreditierung-von-studiengaengen-guetesiegel-und-geschaeftsmodell.html,       accessed 28/08/2013; Court of Auditors for the State of Thuringia, Annual       Report 2008, Ch.
7, pp.114 et seq., available at       http://www.thueringen.de/de/rechnungshof/veroeffentlichungen/jahresberichte/ ,  	  accessed 01/10/2013).
The prospect of reasonably thorough Administrative Court review triggered       by Heitsch's research will rein in the accreditation agencies in the       future, and will have a direct impact on how they do their work.
It will       also lead to significant financial savings for all higher education       academic institutions in Germany.
The impact of such savings will be felt       by over 400 higher education institutions all over Germany, by hundreds of       thousands of German students and their families, and by the state       governments which fund higher education.
