     The research at Star Carr has demonstrated significant impact on       creativity, culture and society.
A management plan, written by Milner and       approved by the English Heritage Advisory Committee (2012), is now in       place which presents a strategy for (i) the preservation by record of the       site and (ii) its relationship to the public [1].
Preservation and conservation of Mesolithic wetland sites     As a direct impact of the research the site was granted Scheduled       Monument status (19 December 2011) and was added to English Heritage's       `Heritage At Risk Register' [2, 3].
Scheduling is the only legal form of       protection available to a site in the UK and highlights the research       findings as `Nationally Important' [4].
Unlike other Mesolithic sites,       Star Carr, was scheduled without relying upon structures from a later       period for designation.
It was scheduled in order to encourage a dialogue       with stakeholders over best management practices, including further       excavation, and to support funding applications by official recognition of       the importance of the site.
Announcing its Scheduling, John Penrose,       Heritage Minister, said "The diversity of finds on offer at Star Carr         and its history which goes back to 9000 BC are unequalled in British         Archaeology and it remains one of the most important Mesolithic sites in         Europe".
As a result of our research, Star Carr has been used as a model for the       national and international importance and vulnerability of wetland       heritage in the National Heritage Protection Plan [5] (section 3A5) and       prompted further funding of &#163;350,000 for other wetland projects.
Milner       has given lectures and talked to colleagues working in related agencies       involved in wetland management and policy in Germany, Finland, Ireland,       Denmark and the Netherlands.
The European Stone Age Bogs network, which       Milner established, now draws members from 12 countries.
Research at Star       Carr has directly informed two of the key aims of this network: evaluating       the risks to the resource and enhancing impact [6].
Enhancements to Mesolithic heritage presentation     Star Carr is generating unprecedented public and media interest for       Mesolithic archaeology locally, nationally and internationally.
Milner has       engaged audiences at over 30 local societies, hosted site visits, open       days and festival events; the immediate audience engaged by this research       is conservatively estimated at 3,000.
The mediated audience is greater       than the 12-14M that the BBC estimate were reached in the UK by news       coverage of the "oldest house in Britain" [7] &#8212; the research has       featured in 6 television and radio programmes, Milner has been interviewed       for over 30 television and radio news broadcasts and contributed to over       100 media outlets around the world.
The team has produced Mesolithic packs       for Young Archaeologists Club and published 5,000 copies of a booklet "The         Story of Star Carr" (2012), sold for public outreach funds and given       to local schools.
A "virtual museum archive" housed in ADS was launched       May 2013 [8].
A key media event featuring the research was a Time Team special       on the submerged Mesolithic landscape of Doggerland (2007, repeated 2009).
In response to this programme Science City York established a partnership       with the Yorkshire Museum and the Star Carr team to produce a creative       response to the Mesolithic period by four artists for a short exhibition       entitled, Artists in the Archives, (April/May 2010).
Continuing       this partnership, research at Star Carr now underpins a major exhibition,       After the Ice, at the Yorkshire Museum (05/2013-04/14, expected       footfall 110,000) (9).
For the museum the incorporation of multimedia to       translate the underpinning research and immerse visitors in the Mesolithic       landscape is groundbreaking and will influence the design of future       exhibitions, two of which are planned to focus on pre-history.
It       includes, for example, a Mesolithic soundscape, a digital flythrough, and       films all produced by University staff and students from their research.
An evaluation of visitors to the exhibition revealed that 81% would       recommend it to others, and 96% were more informed about Star Carr.
Impacts of the exhibition include:            Drawing in visitors to the museum and its region (29% of visitors         sampled had visited the museum because they had an interest in         prehistory, Star Carr and/or this exhibition in particular);       Developing cultural benefit for visitors (the exhibition prompted 43%         to want to learn more about Star Car); benefiting community cohesion by         encouraging visitors to value local links and connections;       Providing educational resources through the activities for children,         especially schools (Figure 1).
Whitby Museum and Ryedale Folk Museum have created new displays on         Star Carr in 2013.
Scarborough Museums Trust is considering how to incorporate material         from Star Carr in their geology museum, The Rotunda.
