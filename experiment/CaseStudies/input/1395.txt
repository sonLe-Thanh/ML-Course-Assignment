     The Feature Selective Validation method represented a revolutionary new       approach to solving the existing problem of quantifying data comparisons       and has significant impacts upon industrial practice.
The papers published by Duffy in 2006 provided a solution to what was       then believed to be an intractable problem at a time when the IEEE had       established a Standards working group to look at numerical modelling       validation.
Duffy's Feature Selective Validation was thus adopted as the       core technique to be used in IEEE Standard 1597.1 [1] - the IEEE Standard       for validation of computational electromagnetics computer modelling and       simulation, and its associated Good Practice Guide 1597.2.
IEEE Standard 1597.1 was published in 2008 and was the first       International Standard dealing with the validation of computational       electromagnetics (CEM).
The standard has been taken up internationally;       for example, the EU-funded project HIRF-SE (High Intensity Radiated Fields       &#8212; Synthetic Environment) is a four-year, EUR 26.5m project (started 1st       December 2008), coordinated by Alenia Aeronautica SpA (Italy), involving       over 40 partners from both industry and academia around Europe [2], It       includes a mandate that IEEE 1597.1 should be used to demonstrate       compliance within the data being used by the consortium, and hence Feature       Selective Validation must be used as the validation tool.
Duffy actively pursued a policy of free dissemination of the details of       the technique.
This policy has resulted in two additional Feature       Selective Validation software tools being made generally available from       the University of L'Aquila and UPC, Spain.
Duffy's group acted as an       advisor to both of these additional software projects.
At least 40       companies and universities have taken copies of the software from both       these sources.
Whilst there was no systematic tracking of users, the tools       have been downloaded worldwide.
The list below indicates some of these       users and represents a mixture of cases where the usage is related to the       standard and other cases where the FSV is being used as a non-parametric       statistic.
In all these cases, the information has been put into the       public domain by the user through publication.
Whilst details of where to       access the evidence of these applications are given in section 5, some       specific examples which demonstrate the reach and significance of the FSV       method and the IEEE standard with users of international standing are:            Boeing (USA) have evaluated FSV for comparing reverberation chamber         measurements [3] - the Boeing Company analysed FSV as a means to compare         results from different measurements and compared these results with         typical non-parametric statistics used for this particular application         and noted the advantage of using FSV compared to relying on expert         opinion.
Cisco Systems (USA) using Feature Selective Validation software         tools to assess their simulation strategy [4] - Cisco Systems Inc used         FSV to investigate the quality of their simulations and measurements for         radiation from heatsinks.
FSV showed that the simulations were in broad         agreement, but there were notable differences with the measurements.
The Canadian Department of National Defence are adopting         Feature Selective Validation for waveform comparison [5] - the         Department of National Defence, Canada, concluded that FSV can be used         as indicators of convergence for iterative determination of computation         parameters, with a particular focus on antenna radiation patterns.
IBM (USA) use Feature Selective Validation for assessing         modelling capability for circuit board design [6] - IBM were interested         in the problem of comparing data from several simulation techniques in         circumstances where reliable measurement data is difficult to obtain and         to use FSV to quantify the cross-comparison of the data.
The Southwest Research Institute (San Antonio, Texas) have used         Feature Selective Validation for test site assessment [7] - the Authors         needed to compare measurements with simulations as part of test site         analysis.
FSV provided the measure of acceptability.
ANDRO Computational Solutions (USA) has used Feature Selective         Validation for antenna co-site performance [8] - Andro Computational         Solutions needed to perform sensitivity analyses for antenna placement.
FSV allowed them to show the high level of sensitivity in antenna         placements and identified further experimentation required.
