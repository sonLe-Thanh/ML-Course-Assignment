Tiotropium is the preferred       initial treatment for patients with COPD, as recommended in the major       guidelines for COPD       management, including the most widely used global evidence-based       guidelines (GOLD 2013)[2],       and the NICE UK guidelines (2010) [3].
The NICE guidelines specify that tiotropium is the only once daily       long-acting muscarinic       antagonist (LAMA) available [3; page 108] and that this should be offered       in preference to four-times-daily       short-acting muscarinic antagonists [3; page 206].
Direct healthcare costs       of COPD       annually are estimated to be over &#163;800 million (NICE COPD Costing Report       2011) and COPD is       the second largest cause of emergency admission in the UK.
It is estimated       that as a result of       implementing the NICE guidelines in relation to prescribing the number of       hospital episodes will       decrease by 5%, saving an estimated &#163;15.5 million [4].
Tiotropium once daily has also proven to improve lung function, reduce       exacerbations, and       improve quality of life and mortality as reported in the UPLIFT study (the       largest clinical trial ever       reported in COPD)[5].
Tiotropium has had a beneficial impact on the       current management of       COPD, improving symptoms, reducing exacerbations and mortality and       provides a cost-effective       therapy [6].
Block-buster global sales       Spiriva&#174; achieved world-wide sales of $4.5 billion in 2012 [7].
It is       widely used as the first-line       therapy for COPD in the UK.
Spiriva is also close to obtaining approval       for use as an add-on       bronchodilator in severe asthma (as predicted by our study [research       reference 4] showing that       tiotropium causes prolonged bronchodilatation in asthma patients) and this       will further swell sales.
Identification of a second long-acting anticholinergic       Our demonstration that glycopyrrolate had a similar pharmacological       profile to tiotropium, with a       slow offset from M3-receptors in human lung, led to the first       demonstration that inhaled       glycopyrrolate was suitable as a once daily bronchodilator.
This was then       co-developed by Sosei       and Vectura, who formulated glycopyrrolate as a dry powder inhaler and       sold it to Novartis who       marketed the drug as Seebri&#174; in 2012       [8].
Glycopyrrolate is also being developed as a metered       dose inhaler (Pearl, Prosonix) and a nebuliser solution (Elevation       Pharma/Sunovion)[9].
Development of novel LAMA       Imperial research has led to the development of novel LAMA, using the       paradigm Imperial       established for the discovery of the long-acting effects of tiotropium and       glycopyrrolate.
For       example, umeclidinium bromide (GSK Phase 3 studies), aclidinium bromide       (Almirall approved in       Europe and USA 2012) and CHF5407 (Chiesi Phase 2 studies).
For example, in       2010 CHF5407       uses our approach with binding and suppression of cholinergic neural       bronchoconstriction in       guinea-pig airways to profile CHF5407, citing our key early references       [10].
In addition, several       combination inhalers containing a LAMA and a LABA, which have additive       effects are also in       advanced clinical development, including glycopyrrolate/indacaterol       (QVA149, Novartis),       tiotropium/olodaterol (Boehringer Ingelheim), umeclidinium/vilanterol       (GSK/Theravance),       aclidinium/formoterol (Almirall) and it is likely that these combination       inhalers will become the most       effective bronchodilators for COPD patients in the future.
In addition,       highly skilled scientists,       trained by the key researchers, are employed as a result of the pharma       programmes developed on       the basis of this work (e.g.
Dr El-bdaoui Haddad and Dr Jonathan Ward,       co-authors of research       references 2, 3, and 5).
