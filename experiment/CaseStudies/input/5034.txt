     KCL research guides government policy: In the late 2000's, a       number of government documents arose highlighting the issues surrounding       the prescription of antipsychotic medication to people with dementia.
A       report on improving services for people with dementia from the House of       Commons Public Accounts Committee, to which Prof Banerjee gave evidence,       specifically discussed the work of KCL when questioning antipsychotic       prescribing practices (1a).
This report is cited in the Department of       Health's (DoH) consultation on the National Dementia Strategy, which,       mirroring conclusions of KCL research, posits that two ways care for       residents in care homes could be improved is by "deployment of         non-pharmacological management strategies for behavioural disorders in         dementia" and by "specialist input into decision making         concerning the initiation, review and cessation of antipsychotic         medication for people with dementia" (1b).
Prof Clive Ballard was a       key advisor for reports published in 2008 by Paul Burstow, MP and the All       Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia.
Burstow uses the findings of Fossey       2006 to support that "promotion of person-centred care...in the         management of patients with dementia with behavioural symptoms provides         an effective alternative to antipsychotic drugs" (1c).
The latter,       an enquiry into the use of antipsychotic drugs in people with dementia in       care homes, also uses Fossey to say that "training and support for care         home staff reduces the need to use antipsychotics in residents with         dementia and can be a viable alternative for managing challenging         behaviour" (1d).
Following these, in 2009, the DoH produced a report led by Prof Banerjee       that details how unnecessary antipsychotic prescribing in people with       dementia in the UK is estimated to lead to 1800 deaths and 1600       cerebrovascular adverse events every year (2e).
The report cites a number       of KCL led studies including Fossey 2006 when discussing prevalence of       antipsychotic prescribing in nursing homes and how behavioural       interventions can help reduce the need for antipsychotics.
For instance,       when stating that "there is a clear emerging consensus about the         positive and negative effects of antipsychotic drugs," the report       cites Ballard 2006 and a 2009 review by Prof Ballard containing this       paper, along with Ballard 2005, 2009a and 2009b (2f).
It also cites the       DART-AD trial (Ballard 2008, 2009b) when saying how "continuation         compared with cessation of antipsychotic medication was associated with         increased mortality."
The government response to this report       included that it needed to "ensure that antipsychotic drugs are only         prescribed to people with dementia when necessary and are not used when         non-pharmaceutical approaches can be equally effective" (2g).
KCL research guides practice: This body of policy work led to the       development of the 2011 Best Practice Guide on optimising treatment and       care for BPSD, written by KCL researchers in partnership with the DoH and       supported by the Dementia Alliance, provides clear guidance on appropriate       use of antipsychotics and safer alternatives.
It also provides a toolkit       following a basic stepped care model and includes clinical checklists and       guidance on symptom assessment, treatment and monitoring.
It cites Ballard       2008 and 2009b as two of only 10 key references and Ballard's 2009 paper       (1f) as a key review (2a).
The guide has been accessed online more than       100,000 times and been distributed to over 15,000 UK clinicians.
It is       available in six languages, with wide international dissemination.
In       parallel, KCL, the Alzheimer's Society and the BMJ developed an e-learning       package for GPs (2b).
The guide is referenced in many government websites       such as the NHS's Clinical Knowledge Summary on Dementia (that also cites       Ballard 2005) (2c) and is as a key resource in the DoH's Dementia       Commissioning Pack (2d).
Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)       guidelines on `Supporting people with dementia and their carers' state       that "people with...dementias with mild-to-moderate non-cognitive         symptoms should not be prescribed antipsychotic drugs because of the         possible increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse events and death."
They back this with studies including Ballard 2005 and they use Fossey       2006 when discussing the utility of training and support when aiming to       reduce drug use and agitation in nursing homes (2e).
Banerjee's 2009       report is also cited in the 2010 NICE `Dementia quality standard'       discussing challenging behaviour (2f).
Regulatory Impact: KCL research has also contributed to two       Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's (MHRA) working       groups in 2009 (3a, with Ballard 2009a as a resource) and 2012 (3b, citing       Ballard 2006 and Banerjee's report).
These highlight the increased risk of       stroke and death with antipsychotics in people with dementia and led to       warning letters circulated to all doctors in the UK.
The MHRA also       produced an `Antipsychotics Learning Module' that cites NICE guidance and       Prof Banerjee's 2009 report (3c).
Overall Impact in Reducing Antipsychotic use in people with dementia:       The combination of these efforts has led to a massive reduction in       antipsychotic prescribing to people with dementia.
Part of the government       response to Prof Banerjee's report on antipsychotic prescribing was to       appoint a National Clinical Director for Dementia.
One of their       responsibilities was to provide the 2012 NHS audit of English primary care       GP practices that encompassed almost 200,000 people with dementia.
This       showed a 60% reduction in antipsychotic use from 2006 to 2011 (4a).
With       permission from KCL, the FITS intervention is being implemented by the       Alzheimer's Society, the DoH, the University of Worcester and HC-One care       homes into a person- centred care training package that is being trialled       in 150 UK care homes, involving more than 5,000 people (4b).
KCL research making an impact across the globe and raising public         awareness: KCL researchers serve as members of the US Alzheimer's       Association and Ballard's 2009 review (1f) is cited in their report       `Challenging Behaviors' (5a).
They have also worked with the US nursing       home regulator Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, who in 2012       launched a national initiative to improve behavioural health and minimise       medication use in people with dementia (5b).
The `Time for action' report       is also cited in the WHO `Dementia: a public health priority,' jointly       developed with Alzheimer's Disease International, when highlighting issues       in the use of antipsychotic medication for people with dementia (5c).
The       contribution of KCL to raise public awareness includes extensive       communication through the lay media, including over 250 national       television and radio interviews and a key role in developing a 2010 BBC1       Panorama episode addressing antipsychotic use in people with dementia       (5d).
They are also involved in development of information packages to       empower carers of people with dementia to have more informed discussions       regarding prescribing decisions, such as those produced by the Alzheimer's       Society (5e).
