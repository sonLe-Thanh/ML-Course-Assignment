     Cranfield's research in manufacturing and measuring has led to production       techniques and machines that have transformed the manufacture of       ultra-precision surfaces such as the mirrors used in space telescopes.
A       spinout company has taken Cranfield's research and created a multimillion       pound business.
The research has also laid the foundations for a new       definition of the kelvin in a radical revision of the SI unit system.
Major elements of impact include:            UPS2-IKC [G4, G5] designed and built a large-scale         diamond-turning and structuring facility, implementing the production         research it had funded.
Cranfield staff operate this commercially on a         site now managed by Glynd&#373;r University.
Trading as UPS2, it         is recognised by its customers as the world's leading commercial         facility [C1, C2, C3] for the supply of ultra-precision large-scale         structured drums for making structures such as lenses.
UPS2 has         sold in excess of &#163;2 million of product in three years to more than 30         customers, several of which are global industrial companies with         household names, such as 3M, Samsung, Microsoft, and Amazon.
Optropreneurs Ltd was industrial co-creator of the UPS2-IKC         proposal to EPSRC [G4, G5].
In 2008, with assistance of UPS2-IKC         and based on production technology developed through the UPS project         [G2] reported in [P2], Optropreneurs secured a &#8364;5 million contract from         ESO to manufacture prototype primary mirror segments for the world's         largest telescope [C4].
ESO's European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT)         Construction Proposal [C5] identified the Cranfield Box grinding machine         for its production planning for the primary mirrors [P3,P4].
Contracts         for their manufacture will be valued at &gt; &#163;100 million to the         selected contractor.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), NASA's replacement for the         Hubble Space Telescope, is due to be deployed in or after 2018.
A         principal aim is to find life-supporting earth-like planets.
Cranfield         made more mirror surfaces for JWST than any other organisation.
The         mirror surfaces (accurate to &lt; 10nm RMS) were made on machines         designed and built at Cranfield using novel machining and metrology         techniques, since copied elsewhere.
The Mid InfraRed Instrument (MIRI)         made in the UK containing the Cranfield mirrors has been delivered to         NASA [C6].
This impact has been publicly recognised by NASA [C7].
A radical revision of the SI unit system is underway, involving the         redefinition of its seven base units in terms of fundamental constants.
This achievement of unprecedented low uncertainty of measurement would         have been impossible without Cranfield's research in manufacturing and         measuring [C9].
The kelvin will be defined within two years in terms of         the Boltzmann constant.
A UK team, including scientists from Cranfield,         has completed the lowest uncertainty temperature measurement ever         performed, establishing a new estimate of the value of the Boltzmann         constant, which for the first time is accurate enough to meet the         kelvin's redefinition criteria.
The measurement has been founded on the         accuracy of manufacturing of a new configuration of acoustic resonator         made at Cranfield, based on world-leading research in surface generation         through freeform diamond turning and freeform surface metrology.
This         means the value of the kelvin and all temperature measurements           worldwide &#8212; or more explicitly the traceability of the kelvin's         universal definition from the Boltzmann constant &#8212; will be secured by         the accuracy of machining and measurement of the Cranfield apparatus         [C8].
