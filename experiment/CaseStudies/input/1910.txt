             Context: The shared simulation industry is estimated by Cisco         to be worth around $5B per annum and an attractive option for         businesses: "The major issue has been that of combining distant           spaces, of immersing multiple users in a shared virtual space where           the technology will effectively cease to be a barrier to           communication.
The challenge for telepresence is to allow people to           move around each other while seeing who and what they are looking at."
(Digital             Studio, January 2011)                  Eye Catching and Eye Gaze and 3D video based               reconstruction for Telepresence Salford's research into           virtuality telepresence produced the first empirical evidence that eye           gaze could be reliably supported to a degree useful in social           interaction, in a medium that could also faithfully reproduce           appearance, taking communication technology from supporting particular           small ranges of non-verbal communication sufficient for specific forms           of interaction, to supporting the range of non-verbal communication           used in most everyday encounters and teamwork.
The research has           informed BBC in its aim to retain team cohesion and creative critical           mass between its sites in London and Manchester and resulted in a           patent of a telepresent chair.
Automobile design: Impact from a balanced emphasis on         integrating teaching, research and enterprise extending significantly         beyond the submitting HEI is demonstrated in a collaboration with Jaguar         Land Rover (JLR) with Brian Waterfield, Jaguar Land Rover's Virtual         Reality Manager, undertaking an MSc dissertation project under Roberts,         leading to the implementation of an exponentially enhanced co-located         visualisation facility in the automobile industry;                 Research that linked immersion to task performance and creativity           fed into the design of JLR's visualisation facility, leading to a           roadmap for VR visualisation at JLR, and car designs that would not           otherwise have been envisaged.
Jaguar Land Rover asserts that           investment in virtual tools and technologies has transformed its           engineering and design capabilities, enabling quicker and more           efficient processes to be introduced for advanced vehicle development,           using Virtual Reality techniques to work faster and smarter, achieving           higher levels of quality, durability and reliability in its vehicles           with less reliance on expensive and time consuming prototypes.
JLR has invested in a new Virtual Innovation Centre (VIC) that           provides a wider, more flexible and sophisticated range of functions           that are being used by more departments across the business.
The opening of the VIC in July 2013 reinforced Jaguar Land Rover's           position as an auto industry leader in harnessing the benefits of VR           and high-end visualisation.
Already it has played a crucial role in           the delivery of the Range Rover Evoque; internationally acclaimed as           one of the most exciting design concepts of its age, the new Range           Rover and Range Rover Sport, and the Jaguar F-Type sports car.
Its design and functionality were influenced by research undertaken           at Salford University by Waterfield, who used his master's course in           virtual reality visualisation and game technology to help explore           virtual processes and understand how best they might be adapted for           use in the auto industry.
He explained: "The work I did on that course helped me define             the right responses in terms of what we wanted to achieve at Jaguar             Land Rover, tailoring some of the activities so that we could help             shape and progress our virtual solutions."
This included a focus on the resolution of the projector technology           used to present the 2D and 3D VR images [3].
Rather than the           low resolution typically favoured in the virtual imaging world, the           research at Salford showed the importance of achieving fine detail.
"My             studies proved that in our industry, or any in which products are             manufactured, resolution is important.
Gaining as much detail as             possible is a prerequisite for our directors."
Jaguar Land           Rover's virtual reality `cave' comprises three screens covering three           walls and the ceiling for 3D image projection.
Two projectors are used           for each screen at a resolution four times that of HD television           pictures, controlled by 16 high performance PCs.
The use of the           ceiling rather than floor for image projection (relating to importance           of matching spatiality of display to task [2]) was also           confirmed by Waterfield's Salford research, where tests with students           revealed this was the best solution for creating an authentic           environment in which to assess the quality of the driving position, be           it the "command" style featured in Land Rover models, or the sports           design associated with Jaguar.
The VR cave has quickly established its value in allowing designers           and engineers to undertake a wide range of tasks in vehicle           development, exploring and interacting with the images using 3D           glasses and hand-held controllers.
In particular this has supported           vehicle development areas such as interior packaging, the lay-out of           controls, aerodynamics, crash performance and the routing of vehicle           wiring and systems, without recourse to building prototypes.
The Evoque has won over 100 design awards and the introduction of           this and the other models coincided with substantial growth in sales.
"Range Rover Evoque tops 100,000 sales of 355,000 in 2012.
The             brand's top five markets were China, the UK, United States, Russia             and Italy which accounted for 65% of sales alone.
Notable product             performances were delivered by the Range Rover Evoque with 108,598             vehicles sold in its first full year of sales &#8212; more than any other             previous Land Rover model."
