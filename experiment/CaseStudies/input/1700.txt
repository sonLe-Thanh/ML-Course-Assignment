     While the impact described here arises from the publications above,       awareness of those       publications beyond Jones' immediate research community has been       facilitated (as       acknowledged in testimonials by Contacts 1 and 2) by Jones' additional       publication of       accessible books on food and archaeogenetics, primarily Feast: Why         Humans Share Food,       awarded `Food Book of the Year' by the Guild of Food Writers and in 2009       placed on the list of       `Outstanding Academic Titles' by the American Library Association.
As a consequence of the widespread awareness of one or more of Jones'       books, and of       various references in Section 3, he was invited to participate in meetings       from which impact       arose.
The first was in February 2009, when Jones was invited to lead a       session with 12 early-career       policy makers from many parts of the world who had been awarded Chevening       Fellowships through the British Council as part of The Chevening         Economics of Climate         Change Programme run by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
Drawing on the       relevance of his research for food futures, Jones delivered tailored       seminars for the Fellows at       the University of Cambridge within a session entitled Climate Risks         and Food.
The Director of the Chevening Programme (Contact 1) draws attention to       the benefit and       impact of Jones' contribution, which can be followed through to policy       advice within the Asian       agricultural sector, for example through the Observer Research         Foundation and One World         South Asia.
The Observer Research Foundation is an       independent think tank that provides       informed and viable inputs for policy- and decision-makers in the Indian       Government and to the       political and business leadership of India.
One World South Asia       disseminates topical       information to audiences worldwide on development issues, makes technology       work for people       at the grassroots and conducts research on best practices in governance.
The second invitation was from Unilever Bioscience to a meeting       organized by them in       February 2010 at their Unilever Discover offices at Colworth Science Park.
Its purpose was to       explore "Man's evolutionary adaptation to his current diet, his diet in       the past and lessons that       can be learned from this with respect to diet and the food industry".
As a       result of that meeting,       and Jones' contribution to it, Unilever has developed an interest in       research into millet and       decided to commit some of its own resources to collaborative research on       the crop.
This       commitment has included joint support of graduate research and an       international workshop,       held in July 2013, entitled Millets: A Past, Present and Future         Solution to Food Security         Challenges.
The latter, co-hosted with NIAB Innovation Farm and       Cambridge, enjoyed       participation from both universities and industry, and drew contributors       from Europe, America,       Russia and China.
Unilever see the collaborative research they are doing with Cambridge on       millet as contributing       to the implementation of their Sustainability Living Plan (Contact       2), particularly in the context       of reducing water use in agriculture.
They also "envisage the research may       further contribute to       other elements of that plan: the improvement of nutrition (we are       interested in the nutritional       advantages of millet), and `better livelihoods' and the wellbeing of the       smallholders with whom       we engage worldwide" (Contact 2).
By demonstrating the global context of the North Chinese centre of origin       of Asian millets,       Jones' research has also led to the significance of the region of Aohan,       Inner Mongolia, being       recognized by policy makers concerned with conservation of agrarian,       social and biological       resources.
In particular, the Food and Agriculture Organization       (FAO) has recognized (in       September 2012) the Aohan Dryland Farming System as a new Globally         Important Agricultural         Heritage Systems (GIAHS) site.
GIAHS is a United Nations initiative       whose goal is to identify       and safeguard Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems and their       associated       landscapes, agricultural biodiversity and knowledge systems.
Its methods       are to catalyse and       establish long-term programmes to support such systems &#8212; and to enhance       global, national       and local benefits derived through their dynamic conservation, sustainable       management and       enhanced viability.
In this context, the Director for the China Office for       FAO/GIAHS has       specifically emphasized the role of research by Jones' group in prompting       greater attention to       the place of minor cereals in future human ecological strategies and       eco-agricultural       developments (Contact 3).
In August 2013 a meeting was held in Aohan to       celebrate the FAO       decision, with Jones' contribution to both the conference and the history       of millet publicized in       the Chinese press (e.g.
China Daily, People China).
