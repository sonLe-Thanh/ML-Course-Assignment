     One of the key routes to impact has been BIM Academy (http://www.BIMacademy.ac.uk       ) formed in       2010 in joint venture with Ryder Architecture.
BIM Academy is an impartial       and industry-facing       centre of excellence that undertakes research, consultancy, software       development, training and       education to support the entire industry in using BIM as a catalyst for       collaborative working.
BIM       Academy's consultancy and training activities are founded upon a strong       research base.
RIBA Enterprises, a national leader in services that cater for the       information needs of the UK       construction industry, has: "worked closely (with BIM Academy) on         research projects investigating         integrating ... assessment tools into the BIM workflow and performing         automated checking of the         building regulations".
RIBA Enterprises confirm that it has: "selected         BIM Academy as our partner         on these projects due to their leadership, expertise and research         excellence in this field" (Source         3).
Our outreach work has been recognised by the UK Government BIM Task         Group as: "an         effective route to disseminating results, effecting technological and         organisational change, and         influencing the uptake of BIM in the UK and beyond" (Source 1).
Between 2011 and 2013 we have       delivered 32 events attracting over 3,000 delegates at venues around the       UK and abroad based on       a sound research base to stimulate awareness of the opportunities and       challenges in the uptake of       BIM, challenge established methods of working, and define better practice.
As a result, we have been applauded by the UK BIM Task Group for being: "...through         participation         and example...highly supportive of the Government's stated ambitions for         transforming the UK         Construction Industry through innovation" (Source 1) and have       become one of the leading `go-to'       information sources on BIM, with over 4,000 followers on Twitter (https://twitter.com/bimacademy).
Prof. Greenwood was commissioned by the Specialist Engineering       Contractors' (SEC) Group to       author BIM Guidance for Specialist Contractors.
The       publication has shaped and informed       practitioner debate in that sector.
According to the CEO of the SEC Group,       it has been: "the basis         for dialogue between the specialist engineering sector and UK         Government" and has been made       available to around 1,500 individual organisations in order to: "gear         themselves up to address the         BIM-compliance questions in PAS 91, the Government-backed tender         prequalification standard"       thus providing the SEC Group's membership with better access to       opportunities for work.
The       document is accessible from the website of the SEC Group who" "estimate         that...it has been         accessed by over 1,000 firms" (all citations from Source 4).
BIM Academy has enjoyed success in national (Constructing Excellence       Special Innovation Award,       2013) and international (Build London Live, 2012; Build Qatar Live, 2013;       Build Sydney Live, 2013)       competitions thereby enhancing the international reputation of UK       knowledge leadership in BIM       and IPD (Source 5).
Based upon experience of, and success in, such       BIM competitions we have       produced Virtual Project, a three-day structured CPD course that       uses BIM software and IPD       principles to allow multidisciplinary teams to work collaboratively on a       realistic project in controlled       conditions.
Virtual Project courses were launched in 2013 as a key       developmental resource to       enhance professional practice and up-skill individual professionals.
There       have so far been three       courses and 20 attendees representing nine companies, including       Interserve, Capita, Desco,       Billinghurst George and Partners, Kiosk, ONE Associates, Surgo, Elliot       Dent and Naylor.
Internationally, members of the BIM research group and BIM Academy have       spoken at events in       Hong Kong (2013), Qatar (2012), Saudi Arabia (2012), and Singapore (2011,       2012) and in 2011,       Professor Lockley was invited to be a member of the international panel of       experts advising       Singapore's Building and Construction Authority on the delivery of the       country's Roadmap for BIM       adoption (Source 6).
Both Lockley and Greenwood participate in UK       Government BIM Task Group       working parties concerned with promoting the UK Government agenda (Source         1).
BIM Academy has also carried out 15 BIM-related consultancy projects       since 2011.
Most       important, in terms of impact, is the creation and authoring of National       Building Specification's       (NBS's) National BIM Library.
NBS services are used on a daily       basis by professionals in the       construction and property industry.
Over 6,000 companies use NBS products       and over 10,000 use       its Construction Information Service.
The creation of the National       BIM Library is: "an award winning         initiative to provide structured BIM objects to the UK construction         industry" and NBS's user base &#8212; designers,       specifiers, and product manufacturers &#8212; can benefit from the alignment of       its other       information services products with newer BIM technologies.
NBS: "selected         BIM Academy as         (their) partner on these projects due to its leadership, expertise and         research excellence in this         field."

The xBIM Toolkit (Reference 6) developed by Professor       Lockley and his team has formed the       basis for securing TSB (&#163;1.85 million) and industry-funded projects,       thereby creating direct benefits       to industry.
For example, the Toolkit has been used by Norwegian company       Viscenario to test and       develop mobile BIM solutions for property and facilities management; by       asset management       services provider KyKloud for lifecycle costing; by Vinci Construction       (UK) to explore the       generation of COBie data from BIM models; and by international product       manufacturer Kingspan,       who use the toolkit in automated manufacturing processes for steel-framed       walling.
The `iCIM'       (Interoperable Carbon Information Modelling) project (2010, total value       &#163;450,000) has created an       interactive and interoperable online design tool to facilitate carbon       assessment as design of a       project proceeds.
The tool was showcased at EcoBuild 2012 and has been       welcomed by the       Chairman of the UK Government BIM Task Group as: "a much-needed         integration of carbon         assessment data and methodologies to manage building carbon data from         cradle to grave"       (Source 8).
The `4BIM' project (TSB 2012) has produced an online tool that       uses Cloud Technology to       facilitate collaborative working in open-standard data between different       project teams.
4BIM has       been adopted by project extranet provider 4Projects to build their       next-generation BIM model       server technology and in particular their BIM in a Browser&#8482;       product.
The group's input has been       acknowledged as vital and: "helped us to embrace new technologies,         enhance our understanding         and exposure of theoretical and industry issues and ultimately helped us         to develop a commercial         advantage over our key competitors" (Source 9).
4Projects       have recently been acquired by USA       company, Viewpoint Construction Software who have enthused about       the benefits of this       collaboration, stating that it has: "...resulted in us completing a         key deliverable in our product         development roadmap with us bringing 4BIM to market.
The         greatly-increased BIM R&amp;D         capabilities our team has enjoyed by working with (Northumbria         University) means we can move         forward with offering our customers a truly great product that will         ensure users are fully compliant         with BIM standards in what is the biggest change to the industry in many         years.
We are proud of         what has been achieved alongside UNN, and look forward to seeing the         global impact of this         project as we integrate 4BIM with our existing ERP product suite".
