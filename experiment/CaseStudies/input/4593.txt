     This early-stage impact narrative describes the effect of Yuan's research       on changes in practice amongst key figures within large global mediation       organisations (representing many thousands of practitioners).
The early       changes in practice described here will continue to yield benefits in the       future, and progress with the collaborations will be regularly reviewed in       line with UoA policy, as described in its impact template.
Yuan's 2011       AHRC Networking Grant (section 3) allowed her to facilitate knowledge       exchange between academics and mediation/conflict resolution practitioners       that has helped the latter groups improve the quality of their practice.
She embedded insights from outputs 3.1-3.2, and from as yet unpublished       work on face management in translation into workshops organised in 2012,       from which the following impacts have arisen.
Challenging cultural values and assumptions through cross-sectoral         dialogue       Professional mediators and translators participating in the workshops       found the interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral participation (academics,       mediators, translators) innovative and highly produc- tive (5.1).
It       allowed them to develop new networks and to challenge some assumptions         underpinning their own practice.
They felt that cultural aspects of       mediation had previously been under-researched and often overlooked       professionally, and that there was much to be gained in terms of improving       their practice by this bringing together of practitioners (mediators and       transla- tors) with theorists (academics): `Many of the issues neglected       so far have now been put on the table.
Many other conferences look at the       same sort of things but the interdisciplinarity is missing most of the       time'; `Serious academic research... [gave] one confidence that there is       some sub- stance to the way one looks at culture in these mediations';       `Really valuable data [came] out of the research for a wide variety of       people (not only mediators and facilitators but also in management and       other professions)' (5.2).
Changing the approach and practice of professional mediators       Senior figures in three global mediation organisations who participated in       the workshops have embedded the new knowledge (about the intercultural       aspects of mediation and use of interpretation in mediation), to effect practical         changes in their practice:            The Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) (5.3) was         the partner for Yuan's research project.
The Centre was launched in 1990         with the support of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and         leading law firms, business and public sector organisations.
It is the         largest independent alternative dispute resolution body in Europe, has         access to over 5000 mediators and neutrals worldwide.
CEDR           Skills offers high-level expertise in consultancy, mediation         training, and coaching, including the leading,         internationally-recognised Mediator           Skills Training programme.
A legal adviser at the CBI and a senior         mediator at CEDR says that the exchanges with academics facilitated         through Yuan's network have improved his understan- ding of Chinese           cultural characteristics that can affect Chinese people's negotiation           behaviour, and have changed how he approaches negotiation in his           professional practice: `From the academics' work, I can appreciate         for example that when a Chinese person says 'yes', it does not         necessarily mean that he or she is agreeing with the other party.
It         could merely be a filler, like 'well' in English, used to communicate         their understanding of what the other says.
Now when I mediate with         Chinese parties, I try to explore with them whether they genuinely agree         or just intend to elicit more information when they say 'yes'.
Moreover,         In China, the person who attends the mediation does not always possess         the necessary authority to settle, which can be different from his or         her European counterpart.
Now I try to explain to the other party that         this cultural difference may change the pace of mediation to help them         adjust their expectations' (5.4).
He also commented on the `costly and         difficult' process of trying to resolve cross-border commercial disputes         through a court process, and the increasing reliance on mediation as a         way of mitigating this.
As such, the commercial impact of           improvements to mediation in cross- border disputes is very           considerable (5.4).
The International Mediation Institute (IMI) is the only         organization in the world to transcend local jurisdictions and to         develop global, professional standards for experienced mediators,         advocates and others involved in collaborative dispute resolution and         negotiation processes (5.5).
Through her presentation of the key         findings at the IMI's workshop on intercultural mediation (7- 8/07/12),         and at CEDR's mediation skills training courses in London (5-11/12/12),         Yuan provoked fruitful discussions amongst other participants who found         the research findings `enlightening', `stimulating' and `empowering'.
The research led them to rethink their approach to the intercultural         aspects of mediation and the use of interpretation in mediation.
Mediators reported that `the research had provided them with a           powerful tool to understand the cultural challenges in international           mediation, and helped them reconsider how to handle the           challenges with informed intellectual knowledge and skills'         instead of from an instinctive basis.
The Director of the Netherlands         Mediation Institute (NMI) expressed his determination to `take what he         had learnt from the researchers back to Holland and further stimulate         discussion and collaboration there' (5.2).
The Union Internationale des Avocats (UIA) (5.6) is the oldest         global association of lawyers in the world, formed in 1927.
Most bar         associations and solicitor organisations around the world are members.
The UIA has various commissions, including the Mediation and Conflict         Prevention Commission.
In 2001 the World Forum of Mediation Centres was         formed as a sub-commission of the Mediation and Conflict Prevention         Commission.
In June 2013, Yuan was invited as a keynote speaker to their         annual forum for professional mediators and lawyers on the topic of         `Using Interpreters in Mediation'.
The President of UIA Mediation         Centres says that Yuan's work `informed the practitioners of the major         social roles and powers that an interpreter possesses in conflict         management, challenging mediators' preconceptions of interpreters as         mere language conduits.
This served to influence their practice and           helped them to improve and achieve successful co-working with           interpreters for the benefit of not just mediators but also         parties in disputes' (5.7).
