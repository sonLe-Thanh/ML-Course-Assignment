     There have been growing concerns about the pollutant effects of HBCD and       in May 2013 the UN       Environment Programme's Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic       Pollutants (POP) agreed       to a ban on its use which will come into force in 2014.
At present more       than 22,000 tons of HBCD       are used globally, with production taking place in the USA, Europe and       Asia (source 1, para 21).
The research findings from Harrad's group were significant sources of       evidence used in the risk       profile for HBCD drawn up for the Convention's POPs Review Committee and       made a distinct and       material contribution to the Convention's decision.
Harrad's expertise on       HBCD was also utilised       in a report commissioned by Defra to consider the UK's stance when       regulation was under       consideration by the Convention.
Global regulation of HBCD     The UN Environment Programme's Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic       Pollutants has       179 parties (178 states and the EU), as at May 2013.
Since the Convention       came into force in       2004, only 21 compounds have had their use either banned or tightly       restricted.
In June 2008, Norway initiated a proposal to add HBCD to this list of       globally-regulated       compounds.
In order to be listed as a POP under the Convention, there must       be evidence of: (1)       potential for long-range transboundary atmospheric transport, (2) adverse       effects, (3) persistence,       and (4) bioaccumulation.
The Convention's POP Review Committee (POPRC) considered a draft risk       profile on HBCD at its       meeting in October 2010, which said that "Based on the available evidence,       it is concluded that       HBCD is likely, as a result of long-range environmental transport, to lead       to significant adverse       environmental and / or human health effects, such that global action is       warranted."
(source 1,       Executive Summary, para 7).
Subsequently, at its October 2011 meeting, the       Committee       recommended that HBCD be listed under the Convention, with this confirmed       at a further meeting       on 19th October 2012.
As a consequence, the Conference of the Parties (the Convention's       governing body) at their 6th       meeting held from 28th April to 10th May 2013 in       Geneva, agreed to list HBCD under Annex A of the       Convention.
This means that the production and use of HBCD will be banned       from 2014, with       some exceptions to 2018 for its use in building insulation (source 2).
Role of Birmingham research     Harrad's findings contributed to this process by providing information on       the magnitude and       pathways of human exposure to HBCD that contributed to the assessment of       potential adverse       human health effects.
His substantial body of research has driven the       conclusion that dust is one of       the main sources of exposure (source 1, paras 6 and 31, and section       2.3.2), with six of his papers       cited in the risk profile.
Of particular value were Harrad's studies which revealed that children       ingest more HBCD than       adults.
One of the authors of the risk profile, [text removed for       publication] of Fisheries and Oceans Canada, has       written to the University to confirm that "Dr Harrad's studies showed,         unequivocally, that children         ingest more HBCD through this exposure route than adults and has raised         concerns that this could         contribute to developmental and neurotoxic effects in infants".
[text removed for publication] highlighted Harrad's       findings during his plenary talk to the POP Review Committee in 2009 and       introduced the       committee to the idea that as an exposure route dust (as well as diet)       accounted for a significant       portion of the exposure to humans, especially infants (source 3).
The initial proposal to ban HBCD was made by the Norwegian Royal Ministry       of the Environment,       and further confirmation of the role played by the Birmingham research has       been provided by       	 [text removed for publication], Chief Scientist of the Norwegian Institute       of Public Health.
As well as       attesting to the contribution Harrad's work had made to knowledge       concerning human exposure,       Professor Becher confirmed the important role played by this research in       establishing the       persistence and bioaccumulative capacity of HBCD:     "Doubts were raised by industry and others whether HBCD was persistent         as standardised         biodegradation tests in soil and sediments did not meet the half-life         screening criteria of the         Convention.
This would also mean that the extent of exposure to HBCD for         biota and humans and         the resulting risks would be low.
Both [text removed for publication] and experts from Environment         Canada then evaluated the latest research         results on HBCD with the aim to demonstrate that HBCD fulfils all the         criteria of the Convention.
In         this respect, the research of Stuart Harrad and his group was extremely         valuable.
They         demonstrated clearly the abundance of HBCDs in abiotic samples of         sediments and the         bioaccumulative property of HBCD in fresh water fish providing evidence         of persistence and         potential for human exposure via fish consumption.
Further, Harrad's group has provided evidence for the occurrence of         HBCD in dust from various         indoor environments resulting from its use in building insulation,         textile coatings and plastics used         in electronic equipment.
Through their work, it was recognised that         ingestion of dust can be an         important source of human exposure besides food.
They produced evidence         that particularly young         children with their characteristic hand-to-mouth behaviour are at risk         for elevated exposures.
These         new exposure scenarios made a significant contribution to the         elucidation of human exposure to         HBCD and possible health impacts for the risk profile on HBCD adopted by         the POPs Review         Committee in 2010.
Based, among others, on this document, the Committee         has proposed for the         Conference of the Parties to list HBCD under the Stockholm Convention on         POPs" (source 4).
Impact on UK policy and practice     In the UK, Defra has paid close attention to the implications of       international regulation of HBCD.
In       2010, the Department commissioned AEA Technology to investigate this.
AEA's report (source 5 )       estimated that approximately 1000 tonnes of HBCD are used per year in the       UK, of this around       90% was used in the construction industry, with the balance used in the       textiles and electronics       industries (source 5 p.3).The report informed Defra's negotiating stance       in relation to the proposed       listing of HBCD under the Stockholm Convention.
Harrad contributed expertise on the environmental chemistry of HBCD for       the AEA report (source 5       section 1.5, page 11), and his findings on the degradation, aquatic       bioaccumulation, and human       exposure to HBCD, contributed substantially to the report's conclusions.
The main conclusion of       the report was that, whilst damage to human health has not been       demonstrated unambiguously,       there is clear evidence for human exposure, and HBCDs meet the Stockholm       criteria for       persistence and bioaccumulation and, hence, for international regulation.
