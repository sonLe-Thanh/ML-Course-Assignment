 a) On Caste and Untouchability i) Support for lobbying The most significant impact of Dhanda's research lies in its contribution to the recent amendment to the Equality Act 2010 enacted by Section 97 of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013.
This amendment requires the government to draw up secondary legislation for the inclusion of `caste' as an aspect of `race'.
The vote in parliament in favour of such inclusion was preceded by intensive lobbying by groups such as CasteWatch UK.
Dhanda shared her research findings with Lord Avebury and Lord Harries before the Lords debate on 04/03/2013 and, more significantly, before the second reading of the Bill on 16/04/2013, Dhanda was approached by a researcher for Peers in the House of Lords, Dorothy Hughes, for advice (see 5a).
Dhanda's contribution to the campaign has been praised by Davinder Prasad, the general secretary of CasteWatch UK thus: `Dr Dhanda has been one of the most committed activist[s] in our cause.
Her research on the subject of caste in [the] UK and her contribution to so many discussions &amp; debates including a conference organised by Sikhs in Birmingham a few years ago was so valuable for our campaign in the early days.
[...] Her contribution to [the] Brit Asia TV debate on Apache Indian show would be remembered and not many Asian academics have the courage to speak out against caste so openly.
[...] If ever any help is required from a Brit Asian academic, Dr Dhanda would be the one who can be relied upon' (See section 5e).
Prasad is referring here to Dhanda's presentation `Caste and Social Cohesion: the limits and potentialities of identity politics', an invited talk to CasteWatch UK annual conference (2008); a lecture on `The Origins of the Caste System in India' at a half-day conference for the general public in Birmingham on Working towards a caste-free society (26/06/2010; audience of over 70); CasteWatch UK panel discussion (02/07/2011) on her published work; and to the TV discussion viewed by 5415 on You-tube (see 5b), compared to 3670 viewings of the Sikh Channel TV debate on this subject aired shortly afterwards.
Dhanda has appeared on community TV (see 5c), clarifying the need for legislation, and addressed several community meetings, for example, of 200 Buddhists in Wolverhampton (04/2012), of 100 Ravidassias in Coventry (17/05/2013), and of the UK Ambedkar Society Southall (06/2013).
Dhanda's advocacy in this regard was complemented during the REF census period by that of another UoA-affiliated developing researcher and expert in Sikh studies, Dr Opinderjit Takhar, who also lobbied Parliament in conjunction with Sikh and Dalit community organisations, participating in UK Sikh Channel TV debates on this issue with Davinder Prasad, Chair of CasteWatch UK (08/07/2013) and as a panellist in the debate on caste legislation (10/04/2013), while maintaining a regular dialogue with the Sikh Council UK, CasteWatch UK and the Anti Caste Discrimination Alliance.
ii) International reach in the community through media, public lectures, and community meetings: Dhanda was interviewed by a New Delhi-based research group on 14/04/2013 (see 5d), and her research was cited in 2013 in a Danish newspaper, Kristeligt Dagblad (http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/509838:Udland--Storbritannien-vil-kastesystemet-til-livs).
She was interviewed live by BBC Radio 4 on 16/04/2013 and Sher-e-Punjab radio (Canada) on 17/05/2013.
She lectured to over 100 students at the Sanghol Educational Institute (established by the House of Lords peer D. S. Rana, in his ancestral village Sanghol, India) on `Challenging Caste Prejudice' (04/10/2010), addressed a public meeting in a school in Navanshahr (12/2011) and a public gathering of over 50,000 dalits on 31/12/2011 in Amritsar, India (see 5h, 5.j).
iii) Informing debates amongst activists/academics internationally: Dhanda's invited lectures at international meetings of academics and activists at the Institute of Advanced Studies, Shimla (11/2011); Center for Women's Development Studies, New Delhi (01/2012); SOAS, University of London (06/2012); Uppsala University (11/2012); University of Leiden (12/2012); Punjab University (01/2013); and Jawaharlal Nehru University (01/2013), have changed the public discourse regarding caste in Britain, hitherto considered a non-issue, bringing it to the notice of scholars and activists internationally.
iv) Mentoring new researchers internationally: Dhanda's Leverhulme Research project Caste Aside (see Reference 6) has provided the added benefit of mentoring two Dalit postgraduates in India through the research process (see letters 5f and 5g).
b) On Gender and South Asian diasporic experience Dhanda's work on gender quotas (2000, see 2.b above) was widely cited and discussed.
Her edited book Reservations for Women (Reference 1), the first ever collection on the topic of gender quotas and a part of an important series on `Issues in Indian Feminism', has sold out (600 copies) and is in libraries (44, according to Google Scholar, with a majority in USA) and is on reading lists on courses world-wide.
Dhanda's research on gender more generally led to public engagement through interviews on radio &#8212; Beacon and The Wolf (Wolverhampton area), BBC West Midlands and LBC (London) &#8212; on the issue of women `veiling'; to an invited lecture on Feminism and Philosophy to an audience of 100 at the oldest women's college in Punjab; as a panellist on BBC3 Night Waves live radio discussion on `Feminism' on 12/04/2012; and on `Prime Debate' on Day and Night TV (Chandigarh) on 29/12/2012, a live broadcast following the death of a gang rape victim in Delhi.
She was also a live radio discussant on Feminist Philosophy (Philosophy Now radio show #14 on 01/11/2011) on the London arts radio station, Resonance 104.4FM).
Reference 3 contributed to a six-country project on `Honour' and Women's rights, a collaboration between an established women's NGO in India and International Development Research Centre, Canada, the results of which are disseminated world-wide, informing discourse on killing in the name of `honour'.
