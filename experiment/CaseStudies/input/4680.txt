     Nature of the impact: People living below the poverty line in       developing countries are often pushed to the urban fringes, into unplanned       settlements.
Houses are built where no municipal infrastructure exists, on       land that is often subject to high levels of landslide hazard.
In the       best-case scenarios, landslides cause disruption, loss and damage of homes       and possessions; in the worst-cases they cause the loss of life.
For       governments, landslides can be expensive in terms of community re-housing       and relocation costs.
The MoSSaiC methodology, which provides a sustainable and holistic       approach to landslide risk reduction, has led to four main impacts: i)       significant reduction of landslide risk for people living in unplanned       settlements in developing countries; ii) indirect benefits to communities       as a result of the water management solutions implemented; iii) economic       benefits to governments; and iv) uptake of the MoSSaiC methodology by the       World Bank in order to extend the reach of the impact to other countries       where urban landslide risk is most acute.
World Bank endorsement of the       MoSSaiC methodology states: "Your initiative, `Management of Slope       Stability in Communities (MoSSaiC) represents a novel approach to reducing       landslide risk.
There are two areas in particular where MoSSaiC makes a       significant contribution, namely community engagement and the associated       on-the-ground delivery of improved hill-slope drainage to bring about       improved slope stability."
[b]     i) Significant reduction of landslide risk for people living in         unplanned settlements in developing countries: Since 2008,       approximately 800 homes across 12 communities have benefited from MoSSaiC       interventions in three island states in the Caribbean.
In 2010, these       direct benefits were realised when St Lucia felt the effects of Hurricane       Tomas, which produced a 1 in 500-year, 24-hour rainfall event [5].
The       World Bank noted that "in the aftermath of Hurricane Tomas (October 2010),       there were numerous landslides in St. Lucia due to the extreme rainfall.
None were reported in any of the communities with MoSSaiC interventions."
[b]     ii) Indirect benefits to communities as a result of the on-the-ground         water management solutions implemented: A cost-benefit analysis of a       MoSSaiC project in St Lucia surveyed residents of the community to       identify and value the direct and indirect benefits the community had       received as a result of the new surface water management and drainage       infrastructure [6].
Direct benefits were the probable avoided costs of       future landslide damage to houses.
Indirect benefits included: lower water       bills through the harvesting of intercepted rainwater from rooftops;       improved access to and from the community due to reduced flooding and       associated debris on footpaths; and therefore fewer days of work missed       and less time spend clearing debris.
Together, these benefits were valued       at EC$12,705 annually [6].
In the eight years that the measures have been       in place, this amounts to over EC$100,000 in estimated benefits to this       pilot community (over EC$63,000 since 2008).
In addition, more than 80% of       programme funds are spent in the communities, which not only creates       employment opportunities (e.g., 25 residents were employed on the pilot       project [c, p24]) but also fosters ownership of the programme within the       community [2].
iii) Economic benefits to governments: A cost-benefit analysis of       the pilot project in St Lucia demonstrated that the benefits of       implementing landslide mitigation measures in that community outweighed       the costs 2.7:1 [6].
iv) Uptake of the MoSSaiC methodology by the World Bank: The Latin       America and the Caribbean Disaster Risk Management team of the World Bank       has been collaborating closely with the MoSSaiC team since 2009, when they       funded the Second Disaster Mitigation Programme in St Lucia, bringing the       MoSSaiC methodology to an additional six communities.
In 2009, the MoSSaiC       methodology was featured in the World Bank's World Development Report         2010 [d, p327] and in October 2011 it was one of 20 projects       selected for the Aid Effectiveness Showcase in Washington, DC [e].
MoSSaiC also features on the World Bank's Latin America and the Caribbean       website, Results in Action [f].
In 2013, the World Bank published       a book co-authored by Anderson and Holcombe entitled Community-based         landslide risk reduction &#8212; managing disasters in small steps [7]       that will later be published in Spanish [b, f].
"The work already has       clear evidence of impact in the field of community-based disaster risk       reduction," said Holm-Nielsen [b].
"The aim is to maximize the impact of       the approach in those countries where landslide risk is most acute, not       only through the use of the book, but through the development of future       additional resources with the support of the World Bank's Latin America       and Caribbean Disaster Risk Management team."
Reach of impact: Since 2008 the MoSSaiC methodology has benefitted       ten communities in St Lucia and one each in Dominica, and St Vincent and       the Grenadines [c, p25].
In 2011, it was introduced to Jamaica through a       programme of community-based projects costing US$2.37 million, funded by       the World Bank [g] and implemented by the Office of Disaster Preparedness       and Emergency Management.
It is expected that the reach of the impact will       be greatly extended with the uptake of the methodology by the World Bank       and publication of the Anderson and Holcombe book in Feb 2013 [7].
Dissemination of the research: The research and mitigation       methodology was delivered using a process of strategic incrementalism with       a view to maximising the sustainability of project outcomes (Anderson and       Holcombe, 2011).
Key steps in disseminating MoSSaiC included:            2004.
Government of St Lucia formalises MoSSaiC Management Committee         [h, p26-27; i, p17].
2007.
MoSSaiC recognised by Institution of Civil Engineers, London         through Trevethick Prize.
2007.
MoSSaiC community-to-community transfer of knowledge through         annual conferences.
These actions led directly to the following impacts since 2008:            2008-2009. International agencies (USAID, UNDP) funded MoSSaiC in the         Eastern Caribbean.
2009-2011.
World Bank funded MoSSaiC projects in St Lucia and included         MoSSaiC as a case study in the World Development Report 2010 [d, p327].
2009-ongoing.
World Bank adopts MoSSaiC as an urban disaster         mitigation method appropriate for scaling up to other developing         countries in the humid tropics [7]
