     Impact 1: Technology Transfer, Exploitation, and the Principal         Beneficiary       The development of fluorescent ligand technologies by Professors Hill and       Kellam led to creation of the University of Nottingham spin-out company,       CellAura Technologies, in 2004 for the commercialisation of a wide range       of novel fluorescent ligands.
Professors Hill and Kellam, as founding       directors, secured initial funding from Lachesis that allowed CellAura's       successful establishment and start of trading at BioCity in Nottingham in       2006.
CellAura received further investments in 2008 and 2010 from several       regional investors totalling approximately &#163;1.8 millionA.
Four University patents were licensed exclusively to CellAura in exchange       for ~12% equityA.
The original two patents9,10,       derived from UoN research, underpin CellAura's core fluorescent ligand       business.
Subsequent development by CellAura of a further 12 ligands added       to the catalogue from 2008 onwards and an additional 34 development       ligands are founded on the original patents.
The third patent11       describes the novel use of fluorescent ligands as alternatives to       antibodies for fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) that has been       adopted by the biotech communityB,C, in part due to significant       assay-time reductionsD.
The fourth patent12       describes a perfusion instrument that allows measurement of ligand binding       kinetics in live cells5,6,7.
The value of these patents to the       University is equivalent to its equity share in the company valuation       (approximately &#163;215,000).
Their value to CellAura is crucial to permit       commercialisation and further development of the catalogue.
A pipeline       agreement between the University and CellAura (dated 2008)A       feeds technology refinements into the business, creating continued       benefits for both parties.
Annual turnover figures for CellAura since 2008       show a steady increase to 2012 (2009: &#163;33,572; 2010: &#163;92,821; 2011:       &#163;174,782; 2012: &#163;179,978; 2013: &#163;96,950)A. CellAura is       therefore the principal beneficiary of the technology transfer and       commercialisation.
Impact 2: Commercialisation and Subsidiary Beneficiaries       CellAura makes direct-to-customers sales in Europe, the US, and       Australasia, to major pharma companies (e.g.
Pfizer, Sanofi-Aventis,       Amgen, Takeda), to GPCR drug discovery biotechs (e.g Addex, Heptares)A       and to academia.
To facilitate access to CellAura's products, regional       distributor agreements were arranged with Funakoshi (Japan) and Fischer       Scientific (UK and Scandinavia) in 2009, and worldwide agreements with       Abcam and Sigma-Aldrich in 2011A.
Between 2009 and 2012,       CellAura developed custom fluorescent ligands for CisBio Bioassays for use       in their Tag-liteTM GPCR high throughput screening (HTS)       assays.
CisBio accepted 18 `active' ligands from CellAura for inclusion in       its assay kitsE.
Promega has also demonstrated that CellAura's       fluorescent ligands can be used very successfully in their NanoLuc-GPCR       ligand binding technology, stating that: "The suite of fluorescent         ligands offered by CellAura have helped validate a novel, enabling assay         principle for studying receptor pharmacology in a simplified, live cell         format.
The combined technologies strongly position Promega as an         innovative leader in the drug discovery community"F.       These companies are therefore subsidiary beneficiaries of the technology.
Since 2008, CellAura has successfully completed custom ligand development       projects for AstraZeneca (2008: 5 GPCR targets) and Novartis (2009: a GPCR       ligand that met multiple physicochemical and biological parameters,       allowing Novartis to "better understand the pharmacological mechanism         of drug compounds and to direct new research on longer acting drugs         targeting GPCRs" )G. A number of smaller custom synthesis       projects for industrial and academic researchers in Europe, US and the Far       East were also completed by CellAura from 2008 onwards.
AstraZeneca also       established a CASE studentship with the University in 2009, supported by       CellAura, to develop a fluorescent agonist for an orphan GPCR (completed       in 2011)H. The custom fluorescent ligands all resulted in       technology benefits for project partners, such as real-time imaging of       fluorescent ligand binding kinetics and internalisation in live cells to       optimise a drug candidate's pharmacokinetics.
For Novartis fluorescent       ligands are "an enabling technology that brings benefits to the         pharmaceutical industry by allowing pursuit of approaches that were         previously unavailable"G and for AstraZeneca, the       benefits fitted well with the company's "principles of lean and         responsible procurement to improve the company's efficiency,         sustainability and environmental footprint.
"H     CellAura has validated the performance of its products on the Applied       Biosystems FMAT reader (2008), and the high content analysis (HCA) imaging       platforms of GE Healthcare (InCell Analyser; 2008), PerkinElmer (Opera;       2008), Molecular Devices (ImageXpress Ultra; 2009) and       ThermoFisher/Cellomics (Arrayscan; 2010), resulting in scientific posters       and marketing materialsI.
CellAura earned a `best new       technology' award at the SBS /ELRIG Drug Discovery meeting in 2008.
In       2012, CellAura established a successful collaboration with BMG Labtech       that showed binding of CellAura's ligands could be read on a conventional       (non-imaging) PheraStar fluorescence reader in whole-cell receptor binding       assays for HTSJ.
Together, the reagent + instrument       combinations provide improved methods for investigating ligand       interactions with GPCRs for drug discovery (Comley J, (2009); Drug         Discovery World Spring 2009, 32-50), bringing additional       benefits to instruments manufacturers and their customers.
Fluorescent ligands also have advantages over radioligands (a &#163;60-65       million annual global market) by avoiding radioisotope safety and waste       disposal issues, reducing their detrimental health and environmental       impacts.
Impact 3: Employment and Wealth Creation       CellAura has created employment for 15 individuals in up to 7 full-time       and 4 part-time posts since 2008.
Three current or past members of the       CellAura scientific staff were trained in the laboratories of Hill and       Briddon (Carter, Rose, Spencer), and a further four (Middleton, Adams,       Beardsell, McCarroll) in other schools at the UoN.
Professors Hill and       Kellam continue as non-executive directors and shareholders, with Dr       Briddon serving as a consultant to CellAura.
