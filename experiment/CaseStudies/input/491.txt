     Persistent pain blights the lives of around 50 per cent of people aged 65       and over.
Whether pain in the knee or hip, a sore back or arthritis,       chronic pain can be isolating and seriously affect quality of life.
Professor Schofield's work on developing a universal pain scoring and       management system is recognised in the UK health profession as the `gold       standard', a view endorsed by key figures under the last heading in this       section: `How professionals are using the work'.
Four impacts rooted in the research done by Schofield and the Centre for       Applied Health Research are described below:     A. EOPIC study     The EOPIC study aims to deliver more effective ways for older people to     self-manage chronic pain, a problem that will affect greater numbers as the     population ages.
The research team included two active service user groups     who were trained to carry out research activities themselves including a     systematic review of the grey literature, enabling them to develop self-help     tools.
These service user groups are fully able to assist in the development     of future research proposals.
The three tools they developed are:            a `How to find literature' leaflet - adopted by the British Pain         Society and British Geriatric Society;       a `How to self-manage your own pain' booklet - adopted by NHS pain         clinics (n = 300) across the UK;       a comic to help older adults explain and discuss their experience of         chronic pain with grandchildren.
The comic was created with Medikidz,         `medical information for kids'.
It has been adopted by NHS pain clinics         in parts of the UK.
Kent Community Health Trust have ordered the         Medikidz comic: http://www.medikidz.com/shop/chronic_pain_explanation_for_kids.html           B.
National pain management guidelines       The research also informed the national pain management       guidelines, `Guidance on the management of pain in older people', which       were developed and launched at the University of Greenwich in 2013.
This       represents the first such guidance in the UK; only two other countries       have produced guidelines (USA and Australia).
The guidance document,       commissioned by the British Pain Society and British Geriatric Society,       reviews the epidemiology and management of pain in older people via a       literature review of published research.
Its aim is to inform health       professionals who work with older adults in any care setting on best       practice for the management of pain and to identify where there are gaps       in the evidence that require further research.
The guidance was published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the       British Geriatric Society: an entire issue (2013.
42 supple.
1) of the       high impact journal Age &amp; Ageing was devoted to its       dissemination.
The guidelines have been widely adopted across the UK by a       number of high profile charities, including the British Pain Society and       the British Geriatric Society: http://www.bgs.org.uk/index.php/press/2471-managing-pain-in-older-people.
Although the guidelines were developed for use in the UK, they are already       gaining international attention and have been widely cited in the US by       for example, the American Geriatric Society.
Supported by funding from       Dementia UK, a website was developed to promote the guidelines and support       their use.
They were launched nationally at a high profile event on 13 May       2013 http://kt-       equal.org.uk/calendar/56/67-Technological-advances-to-managing-pain-in-older-adults-with-       dementia.
They have also been adopted in practice by ambulance       services in two regions.
The Pain Assessment Guidelines have been promoted       by Health Professionals across the UK including the RCGP and RCN.
The National       Lead Clinician for Chronic Pain Healthcare Improvement Scotland, Dr       Steve Gilbert (http://www.painassociation.com/what-people-say/dr-steve-gilbert/) is promoting them across Scotland: http://www.knowledge.scot.nhs.uk/pain/patient%27s-page/pain-in-older-people.aspx   C. National pain assessment guidelines and iPhone app:       The new `app' for assessing pain in older people has brought the national       pain assessment guidelines to new audiences, and in a format which       practitioners are finding very useful.
It has already been tested in a       feasibility study with the South East Coast Ambulance service, and       received positive feedback from paramedics regarding its use for measuring       pain in adults with dementia.
The South East Coast service has adopted the       app for everyday use.
Other impacts of the app so far:            It is currently being evaluated by the Ambulance service in two areas,         and has already had a very positive response from staff.
It has been added to the Scottish Pain Network Website.
The app is now being adapted for use in Hong Kong; and       it is central to a bid being developed for the National Institute of         Health by Professor Cary Reid at Cornell Medical School in the US.
D. Summary of impact from HEIC:       The dementia and pain online training package is currently the subject of       an evaluation within a local NHS trust and has been adopted by the South       London HIEC website, where it is also available for open access.
In       addition, Kent Community Health NHS Trust has expressed an interest in the       learning pack and are looking to add it to their Pain Standard.
How professionals are using the work       The University of Greenwich commissioned consultants to ask individuals in       five key posts to assess the impact of this work.
Their responses are       summarised below:     The Chief Executive of the English Community Care Association:         Department of Health Independent Sector Dementia Champion and Vice-Chair         of the International Longevity Centre commented that 70% of patients       in care homes have some form of dementia, and that pain can induce a range       of challenging behaviours, which has a direct impact on the effectiveness       and efficiency of care provision.
Therefore, he has taken the Pain APP to       implement across all of his organisations in the UK.
A GP based in Huddersfield who is the national pain champion for         England, chair of the RCGP, and honorary secretary of the Pain Society       commented that this work has given him: "...better evidence... the ability       to do my job better...I apply this at every opportunity."
As evidence of       the reach of this work, he lectures in many countries, including Malaysia       and Hong Kong, primarily to primary care practitioners where he always       mentions and promotes Schofield's research as he considers her to be the       "guru" on pain in older people.
The National Clinical Lead for Chronic Pain (Scotland) commented       that within a short space of time, they are sharing the work with the       professional local care community and care home staff across Scotland.
The Clinical Lead for the South East Ambulance Service who is         responsible for Emergency Operations and the 111 service commented       that the vast majority of the 2,000 operational staff are benefitting         from the work, in particular by deploying the App when dealing with       patients.
He estimates that in 90% of cases, pain has been managed         better since introducing the IPhone App.
As pain is now being       addressed as soon as possible, this often negates the need to visit       clinics and/or hospitals.
The iPhone pain App is included in the new       Dementia Atlas, currently being developed by South East Coast Ambulance       Service.
The Lead Nurse for Pain Management at Royal Brompton and Hatfield NHS         Foundation Trust, who is also Chair of the RCN Pain and Palliative Care         Forum, stated that the guidelines had changed practice and       influenced the education of all health professionals working in the Trust.
Pain is now the focus in 85% of instances, up from 70%,       specifically due to improved pain scoring.
In summary, there was a general consensus amongst key people that the       universal pain scoring and management system developed by the work of       Schofield is now recognised as the `gold standard'.
All the interviewees       commented that it was a much-needed, significant, and insightful piece of       work that was universally accepted and commended because it was       patient-centric, displayed creditable science, and the recommendations and       scoring system were very user-friendly.
