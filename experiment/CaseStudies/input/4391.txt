     Jackson's research has resulted in direct involvement in the Nepali peace       process as well as in the provision of expert advice on security sector       reform to UK government and other users.

Facilitating implementation of security sector reform in the Nepali         Peace Process     Jackson was appointed in 2010 as the only International Adviser to the       Special Committee of the Nepali Parliament on the Integration and       Rehabilitation of Maoist Combatants.
His appointment arose due to his       research expertise in the development and implementation of peace       agreements to end civil wars, and specifically the ways in which       combatants from opposing factions could be integrated to form new national       defence forces.
In Nepal, a ten year insurgency by Maoist guerrillas ended with a peace       accord in 2006, a central element of which was that Maoist combatants       would be integrated into the Nepalese Army.
Jackson was appointed as       International Advisor at a critical point in the implementation of the       peace process.
The Nepalese Army was reluctant to permit integration to       take place due to concerns that the guerrillas were politically       indoctrinated and would undermine the Army's neutrality, while within the       Maoist Party there were disagreements about the wisdom of the settlement       itself.
With some 20,000 former Maoist combatants confined to camps in the       four years since the peace agreement was signed, continued stability was       dependent on overcoming this political problem.
Between 2010 and 2013, Jackson was engaged inside the peace process on a       regular basis.
This was a unique contribution given the Nepali       participants' usual disinclination to include outside experts.
Jackson's       involvement was at the instigation of a senior Nepali official who had       read his work on security sector reform in post conflict situations, and       who had previously studied in the International Development Department at       the University of Birmingham where Jackson is based.
Jackson's specific contribution has been in facilitating discussions       between the leadership of the Maoist movement, other political parties and       the Nepali Army, thus enabling the stalemate between the various factions       to be overcome.
This led directly in 2013 to the         demobilisation and rehabilitation of the 20,000 Maoist combatants and         their reintegration into the Nepalese state, some as members of the       Army and others taking a retirement payment and returning to civilian       life.
In undertaking this mediation role, Jackson drew on his research on       state-building in post-conflict states to shape the perspectives of       participants' on issues of security and justice, thereby ensuring the       demystification of the language used in negotiations.
In this role, he       created a space in which safe discussions could take place and agreements       reached.
The Chairman of the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and a       former Prime Minister, commented that Jackson's: `thoughtful ideas,       pragmatic recommendations and profound experience on the integration and       rehabilitation process have made a substantial contribution to         conclude[ing] the peace process' (see source 1 below), while HM       Ambassador to Nepal &#8212; a close observer of the process &#8212; said: 'I have       little doubt that [Jackson's] sustained engagement and advice has made         a large contribution to the technical and political discussions on this         key pillar of the peace process' (source 2).

Shaping the policy and practice of security sector reform     Jackson's extensive research on security sector reform has underpinned       his role as a key advisor to UK government and, increasingly,       non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other national governments       concerned with bringing peace and stability to conflict zones.
Recognition       of Jackson's expertise led the UK government's Department for       International Development (DFID) to commission him to undertake an       independent evaluation of the UK's 1997-2007 peace-building intervention       in Sierra Leone, following the civil war in that country.
Its purpose was       to document and learn policy and operational lessons that could inform any       future UK government interventions.
This policy evaluation produced a book (output R1 above) and a detailed       policy report for DFID (source 3).
This has been complemented by the       production of a working paper series, published by the GFN-SSR, which       provides advice to practitioners engaged with SSR programmes.
These       outputs emphasize the significance of engaging with local as well as       national security actors in peace-building efforts and have been used as a       resource for the UK government's security and justice training (source 4).
The UK Government Stabilisation Unit (bringing together efforts of the       FCO, DFID and the MoD) has described Jackson's work as `very         influential both in terms of how the policy community thinks about       security sector reform and how DFID thinks about its own approaches'       (source 4).
The OECD has similarly observed that `the quality of       (Jackson's) analysis (lies in) his understanding of the international       policy debate on the issues and his familiarity with the operational       constraints that actors face, (this) ensures his work feeds directly         into a broader process of OECD policy development' (source 5).
Jackson's role has been formalised since 2011 in his role as advisor to       the Stabilisation Unit and to the DFID Head of Profession on security and       governance.
In these capacities, Jackson has a direct input into UK       stabilisation policy and evaluation.
The Stabilisation Unit has further       noted that Jackson's `appointment is further proof that he has been         not only influential but also valued by the UK policy community'       (source 4).
Jackson has also been central to the GFN-SSR (2006-2010), a &#163;3.5m       programme funded by DFID, designed to provide policy-relevant research       findings directly to the UK government.
Over a four-year contract period,       Jackson designed and delivered a research-based training package       four times each year.
The course was aimed at developing the expertise of       policymakers in the theory and practice of SSR.
In 2010, following the end       of the contract, Jackson led a consortium involving university, government       and private contractors in the delivery of Security and Justice training       across DFID, the MoD, the FCO and the Ministry of Justice, as well as to       participants from the NGO sector and foreign governments (including       Germany, the US, Italy, The Netherlands, South Sudan, Nigeria).
To date, more         than 500 UK personnel have been through these senior level courses       and have thence gone on to be deployed in UK overseas stabilisation       operations.
