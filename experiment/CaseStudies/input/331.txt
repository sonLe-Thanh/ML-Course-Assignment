     The significance of the research on user-oriented information systems       design lies in the adoption       of user models and user-driven approaches in systems development and       evaluation practices.
This       represents an important cultural change in the practices of IT       professionals and companies which       are usually technology, rather than user, driven.
The research has       impacted on a variety of       projects with multiple beneficiaries in both public and commercial sectors       including cultural heritage       institutions, health sector institutions, software development companies       and companies in the       cultural and creative, transport and logistics, and food sectors, in       Europe and worldwide.
This has       led to the following categories of impact:     1.
Enhanced systems development and provision at beneficiary         organisations     Clough, Sanderson and Petrelli's research on enhancing the performance of       information retrieval       systems through understanding users' information searching patterns (e.g.,       through analysis of       search logs), the gathering of users' information needs (e.g., through       interviews and surveys), and       evaluating search performance has impacted on search systems hosted       nationally and       internationally and accessed by users worldwide.
Direct impact has been       through beneficiary       funded research and includes independent projects on WorldCat, Search25,       and the search       system of The National Archives.
Each project has resulted in a technical       report that has been       widely disseminated within the funding organisation and used to enhance       the respective search       system.
Each project has followed-on from an earlier collaboration, for       example: the lead       collaborator at OCLC (WorldCat) was a participant in the MultiMatch       EU-funded project; the lead       collaborator at The National Archives is on the Unit's Advisory Board,       contributes to the Unit's       teaching programmes and is an alumnus of the Unit; and the Search25       project was initiated by a       collaborator who had previously been at The National Archives.
WorldCat: the world's largest network of library content and         services used by more than         72,000 libraries in 170 countries, provided by the OCLC, US.
"....The           findings and           recommendations have been used to support enhancements and upgrades to           WorldCat.org,           as well as a marketing strategy... An enhanced version of WorldCat is           available to member           institutions and the changes to the system will impact most of the           25,900 OCLC member           libraries, archives, and museums."
[S1]        Search25: a search tool launched by the M25 Consortium of         Academic Libraries in October         2012 that provides a single access point to the library catalogues of         nearly 60 world-renowned         institutions (e.g., The British Library and The British Museum) and         specialist collections (e.g.,         Courtauld Institute of Art).
"The outcome from this work very clearly           had a significant impact on           the services provided by the M25 Consortium through informing the           design of new search           services" [S2].
The National Archives: publisher of the UK Government's         official archive containing over         1000 years of history with a remit to collect and secure the future of         physical and digital         government record and make it as accessible as possible.
"The           outputs of the work were           provided in such a focused and timely way that they have been able to           dovetail with our system           development activities this year [2011] and inform critical decisions           in designing our new           resource discovery system to the benefit of the organisation and           ultimately the public that use           it" [S3]          2.
Development and commercialisation of new technologies and systems     Vasconcelos's research in the EUFP7 OrganiK project stemmed from PhD       research funded jointly       by the University of Sheffield and SEERC (South-East European Research       Centre) in Greece       during which Vasconcelos formed a new collaboration with SMEs in the IT       sector that already had       a relationship with SEERC.
Impact was explicit within the funding scheme       (EUFP7 Research for       the Benefit of SMEs) which required that the participating SMEs co-own the       IP and drive the       development and commercial exploitation of the project.
The research led       to the development and       evaluation of a knowledge management framework and system that has       impacted directly on the       SMEs.
It has also led to further development and enhancement of the       framework and system in       different contexts in which the adoption of user-driven approaches and       methodologies continue to       be key.
The technology is also being exploited commercially by two of the       SME partner       organisations who, under the terms of the funding, co-own the intellectual       property rights, and have       formed start-up companies.
The clients of these companies are also       beneficiaries of the research       and include companies in the IT, creative and cultural industries, as well       as the construction,       transport and logistics, and food sectors.
The two start-up companies that       are exploiting the       technology are:             Intempra (www.intempra.com), an independent company that         has its origins in SME         beneficiary Syria Informatica, is further developing and localising         aspects of the OrganiK         system in the south of Italy, supported by the Regional Government of         Puglia.
This includes the         development of Enterprise 2.0 solutions (i.e., the use of social         media/software for internal and         external enterprise-level collaboration) with incorporated semantic         technologies.
Implementations of Enterprise 2.0 solutions were carried out within         companies in the         automotive industry (Baldasarre Moto) and food sectors (Italian         Cupcakes) in Italy and can be         found at www.intempra.com/it/portfolio.asp.
"The whole OrganiK           project (not simply the           framework) had a real strong and live impact on our companies, giving           us more awareness           about the next year market trends, how to manage the evolution of the           web applications, how           to help and drive customer needs, giving us the right company vision           and mission to drive the           change on the market, and being a successful company in this critical           market situation.[...]
What I learned ... was the methodology and the way to approach           things" [S4] [S5]        Gnowsis (gnowsis.com), spin-off of the leading         German research institute DFKI, is a semantic         web company whose main product is Refinder (www.getrefinder.com/about/),         a knowledge         management system for small businesses (marketing agencies, artists,         web-companies,         technology start-ups and other companies in the media and cultural         industries) in Germany and         Austria, to enable better productivity of knowledge workers through         personal information         management.
This system currently has c. 2500 registered users.
"The           technology of the           OrganiK project was an inspiration for what we are doing in Refinder           [...] The benefit is in a           better productivity of knowledge workers and in a cultural change,           towards a self-controlled           information management under the direction of the individual worker,           away from a manager-           controlled information management.
This is also a cultural change."
[S6].
The cultural shift from         manager-controlled information management to self-controlled information         management         promotes much more stream-lined work processes.
Refinder users and         Gnowsis clients state:           "A lot of times information was left in e-mail inboxes or we wasted           time with useless one-to-one           e-mails - now we can focus on projects and activities instead of           searching for missing pieces.
Refinder improved the way we communicate as a global organization and           gave us a structure           to continue our growth."
[CEO, FMX World] and "We exchange           tasks and documents with           marketing and creative freelancers.
Refinder helped us to keep track           of them and increased the           quality of our marketing activities.
It saved us a lot of time already           so that portatour can save           time for sales reps." [CEO, portatour] [S7]          3.
Downstream impacts     OrganiK partner, the Language Technology Centre (LTC), a language       technology development       company, has adopted and extended the OrganiK platform and system in the EU       funded project       MorMed (www.mormed.eu) to "[...] combine the semantically-enhanced         social networking and         content management OrganiK platform with technologies enabling machine         translation and post-         editing by human experts to make content available in multiple         languages" for medical       communities.
The OrganiK development approach has been adopted in this       project.
The system       (available at lupus.mormed.eu) has been developed for a community dealing       with Lupus       (Antiphospholipid Syndrome) and involves a reported c. 1000 users       (researchers, medical doctors,       general practitioners, patients and carers), at the following centres of       excellence in Lupus       treatment: Hospital Clinic Barcelona (Spain); Medical and Health Centre,       University of Debrecen       (Hungary); Universitaet Medecin Johannes Guttenberg (Germany); &amp; Kings       College London (UK).
