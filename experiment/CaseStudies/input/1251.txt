     Movers &amp; Shakers (M&amp;S) is a programme that engages older adults       from isolated and socially disadvantaged communities, and encourages them       to lead healthier lifestyles.
This innovative, inclusive, self-care model       supports healthy ageing and wellbeing for older adults, enabling them to       live longer, independent lives.
Movers &amp; Shakers groups were first established in Wycombe District in       2009, and subsequently groups have been formed in Aylesbury Vale and       Chiltern Districts.
The founding committee had the following members:                                &#160; Rev.
Dr. Gwen             &#160; Collins           &#160;Chairperson           &#160;Minister, Trinity URC             &#160;(hosts of M&amp;S Caribbean-style)                             &#160;Dr. Michael Bowker           &#160;Secretary           &#160;Retired GP (voluntary community worker)                             &#160;Dr. Graham Storer           &#160;Treasurer           &#160;Retired Engineer (voluntary community worker)                             &#160;Olga McBarnett           &#160;Committee             &#160;Member           &#160;Bucks PCT Dev.

Volunteers establish       and run the weekly sessions, supported by a community development team       from NHS Buckinghamshire.
(Sources 1, 2, 3 and 5)     In September 2011, Movers &amp; Shakers partnered with Wycombe District       Council and expanded the project into sheltered accommodation units in       Wycombe, supporting local people aged over 55 within the health and       wellbeing initiative (Sources 3 and 4).
The project also extended       its reach to a variety of communities, starting with its Caribbean         Style group, and now including Asian Men's Style, Islah Asian         Women's Style and Chinese Style.
(Sources 1 and 5) A       VIP Style group has also been established, for adults with learning       disabilities.
From an initial base of 50 people, there are currently approximately 500       older people from diverse cultural backgrounds involved, with 200 people       participating in group sessions each week.
Participants undergo a health       check when they join a group.
Sessions include opportunities for gentle       exercise, including seated exercise, for mental exercise (eg Suduko) and a       time for eating a healthy meal together.
Tips on healthy eating are       incorporated into the sessions (Source 6).
Evaluation of benefits has identified the following: i) older people,       previously unaware of having high blood pressure, contacting their general       practitioner to address this issue, and ii) modest weight loss.
Participants also reported social and emotional benefits from       participation (Source 6).
In recognition of its good practice and innovation, Movers &amp; Shakers       won first prize in the Mental Health and Wellbeing category at the 2010       NHS South Central Health and Social Care Awards, and also won the runner       up position at the 2010 Bucks Sports Award in its Community Challenge       category.
Plans are underway to expand the project to include three       further groups in Buckinghamshire at Princes Risborough, Lane End and       Gerrards Cross.
Following the successful pilot of the VIP Style in       High Wycombe, it is planned to launch a similar group in Aylesbury for       adults with learning disabilities.
Discussions are being held with Bucks Mind and Wycombe Mind to become       stakeholders and support the further expansion of M&amp;S with funding for       two co-ordinators, a pool of dedicated instructors to train new       instructors to work with older adults, equipment for health checks and       resources for longitudinal research into the programme.
Outside of the       county, interest in adoption of the model has been expressed by Hillingdon       Borough Council and by a housing group operating in Hertfordshire.
To       facilitate the formation of new groups, a short guide has been produced       which outline the steps required to set up a Movers and Shakers group       (Source 7).
The project leader, Olga McBarnet, Joint MH Community Lead for       Buckinghamshire County Council, has ambitions to extend the M&amp;S       initiative nationwide (Source 6).
She recently wrote to the University,       saying, "In a national context, I see myself as the overall project       manager or CEO responsible for disseminating the initiative using the       methodology of localism for community based social enterprises, utilising       local connectors to ensure ethos of M&amp;S layout is adhered to.
There is       potential for increasing local employment (transporting participants in       rural settings, gardening for home grown produce for use in venues,       recruiting a dedicated pool of exercise and craft instructors,       volunteering etc.)
as well as social inclusion and building a more       cohesive community."
The University supports the expansion of this programme in line with the       research group's future strategic plans for collaboration with external       organisations, for example by organising a conference in June 2014       focusing on older people, exercise and recreation and showcasing Movers       &amp; Shakers.
Furthermore, the research impact will be enhanced through       capitalising on this programme and developing new interdisciplinary       synergies (e.g., psycho-physiological aspects of ageing).
