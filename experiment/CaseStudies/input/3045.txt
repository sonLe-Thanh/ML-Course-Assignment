     Context     Chemical processes are highly complex, multi-stage operations where       traditional thinking is       focused on the effective process design of each stage.
The BRITEST tools       and methodologies that       resulted from the research are highly innovative in promoting a whole       process analysis approach,       with input from both scientists and engineers.
This novel approach is       necessary to fully understand       the complexity of processes within the high-value manufacturing sector.
Pathways to Impact     The underpinning research was conducted in collaboration with industry       and the resultant tools and       methodologies continue to be effectively used across high value chemical       manufacturing sectors.
The active engagement of industry throughout the research and development       stage, and the       establishment of BRITEST Ltd in 2001 to provide an effective route to       market, has ensured that the       original research has gone from strength to strength with the full backing       of industry through       membership subscription and continuing in-kind support.
Manchester holds       the IP arising from the       initial research and has granted an exclusive license for use and       exploitation of the tools and       methodologies to BRITEST Ltd. Further investment in BRITEST, via increased       membership and       collaborative research projects, has ensured the continued development and       expansion of the       toolkit over the last 12 years.
BRITEST Ltd is a not-for profit global       organisation, owned and       directed by its members, both industrial (19 companies) and academic (5       institutions).
Currently       the company has 8 staff and a turnover of &#163;800k in 2012-13 [i].
Reach and Significance of Impact     Process design is fundamental to chemistry-using industries including       pharmaceuticals,       agrochemicals, electronics, food and consumer products generating an       estimated &#163;195bn GVA       each year in the UK alone, with processing activity accounting for 40 % of       the product cost.
The       BRITEST tools and methodologies enable companies to understand complex       process chemistry,       and develop innovative process solutions.
An intensifying focus on the environment and climate change is driving       industry to challenge the       sustainability of its manufacturing processes, to ensure that products are       produced in the most       sustainable manner.
BRITEST is helping its members meet this challenge and       remains active in       the development and implementation of sustainable process design solutions       to deliver improved       process efficiency including energy savings, reduced waste and lower       solvent usage.
Furthermore       products must meet strict government legalisation and Christine Moore, the       U.S. Food and Drug       Administration Acting Director of New Drug Quality Assessment, has       recognised BRITEST as one       approach for product understanding in the drive for quality and design as       companies "seek a         systematic process for the assessment, control, communication and review         of risks to the quality of         the drug product" [ii].
Members of BRITEST report significant benefits including increased       throughput, reduced capital       expenditure and improved asset utilisation.
One member was considering       commissioning a new       plant but after evaluating the manufacturing process using BRITEST tools       &amp; methodologies,       substantial improvements were made to the existing process and investment       in a new plant was no       longer considered necessary.
In 2012 Mark A. Phillips, a Process Expert       with GSK, submitted       written evidence to the House of Commons Science and Technology Select       Committee, describing       BRITEST Ltd as "one of the most successful translations of research         from academia to the         development of tools and techniques within industry to improve the         introduction of new products in         the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors" [iii].
The reach of BRITEST encompasses the UK, Europe, the United States and       South East Asia with       a wide range of industrial sectors from mining and consumer goods to       pharmaceuticals.
Examples       of industrial members are Pfizer, Johnson Matthey and Procter &amp;       Gamble.
Academic members       include Newcastle, Nottingham, Limerick and Purdue (USA).
Sue Fleet,         BRITEST CEO, says "a         typical BRITEST process study realises a saving of &#163;250k.
With more than         2000 such studies         performed since 2008, BRITEST has delivered economic impact in excess of         &#163;500m" [i].
Below       we provide several illustrative examples.
lllustrative Case Studies:            Company A is an international organisation [text removed for         publication].
Over the last 5 years,         the company has used the BRITEST toolkit to evaluate and optimise their         chemical processes [text         removed for publication].
During this time "substantial benefits           have been achieved including, a           reduction in processing costs, improved yield, and reduced solvent           usage as well as significant           process optimisation benefits.
In one particular process study, the           company [text removed for         publication] using the BRITEST tools to identify where the process           could be optimised.
In           implementing changes identified through the study a reduction in cycle           time from 41 to 35 days           was achieved, yield was improved by 5% and a financial gain of &#163;80k           per campaign1 resulted" [iv].
Company B [text removed for publication] uses BRITEST tools &amp;         methodologies to routinely         evaluate its [text removed for publication] development processes and         has been actively engaged         in the BRITEST innovation programme during this time.
In 2011, the         company used the BRITEST         toolkit to address a problem they had been experiencing for some time on         [text removed for         publication].
The BRITEST study "helped them analyse the problem           from first principles and           generated an action list which ultimately identified the root cause of           the problem.
A multi-disciplinary           approach using several of the BRITEST tools and methodologies enabled           the company           to find a permanent solution to the problem resulting in a GBP 500k           annual saving to the company"         [v].
Company C [text removed for publication].
In 2012, it employed a         BRITEST study methodology         to evaluate an established production system they had been operating for         over 25 years.
The         BRITEST tools enabled them "to gain a clear understanding of each           stage of the process and           identified ways in which they could optimise the whole process.
The           resulting action plan and           laboratory trials enabled them to remove two process stages and           streamline the whole process           resulting in an improvement in product yield from 76 - 81%; a 60%           reduction in production cycle           time and a 15% reduction in production costs.
The process optimisation           achieved as a result of the           BRITEST study has generated a value of &#163;160k per production year"         [vi].
Company D [text removed for publication].
Using the BRITEST tools and         methodology [text         removed for publication] has been able to deliver step-change advances         in manufacturing that has         enabled them to compete effectively in the global market.
The company's         Managing Director states         that "use of the BRITEST tools and methodologies, together with our           active participation in the on-going 		  development of the toolkit, enables us to contribute to, and           benefit from, a sustainable,           competitive industry that offers better science and innovative           processes.
A project undertaken           recently involved producing a new product for a new customer.

Using the BRITEST study approach throughout, the company was able to           understand the process           better, identify the problems, discover the solutions and fully           optimise the process as it moved from           laboratory to pilot-plant and onto full scale production.
In using the           BRITEST tools, the company           realised a 5% increase in product yield, a 10% increase in margin and           zero off-site disposal costs"         [vii].
