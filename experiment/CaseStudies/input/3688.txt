     Exploring a historical perspective to depression and demonstrating that       perception and individual experience of illness is interwoven with the       cultural, social and intellectual contexts of the time has been       particularly instrumental in the development of the impact.
It has led to       collaborations in the form of workshops with a range of local mental       health groups and health practitioners and with local organisations such       as Tyne and Wear Museums, who mounted the public exhibitions.
There has       been a measurable impact on medical practitioners, on members         of the public, some of whom have been patients or are family of       patients and on those working in the field of arts therapy.
Medical Practitioners     On 10 February 2013 Ingram, by invitation from a well-known       psychotherapist, ran a one-day workshop in London on `Patients and their       Gaolers' as part of the `Inner Circle' series aimed at practising       psychotherapists.
Views expressed as feedback demonstrate the kinds of       impact this research has had on medical professionals: "This talk has         broadened my outlook on the use of language &#8212; particularly with respect         to accounts of "madness" from an historic perspective" (source 1); `It         has given me a greater insight as to how so-called "mental disorder" was         "identified" and "treated" in the 18th century and hence to think about         how it is regarded today.
It has reinforced the way I try not to be         judgemental of my clients and how not to have preconceived ideas of         their "condition"' (source 1); "I am the more determined to         resist the pressure ... to perceive "mental disorder" where I see a         humanly intelligible social situation.
The historical reflection is         directly relevant to achieving clarity in present-day therapeutic         practice" (source 1).
More broadly, feedback from the `Before       Depression' lectures and from the website downloads (www.beforedepression.com)       has testified to the beneficial effects of this work in illustrating that       diagnoses are more a function of subjective opinion rather than objective       science (questionnaire feedback from clinical psychologist, source 7) and,       from a lecturer in mental health nursing, that the research had the effect       of persuading his students "to see practice in terms of changes and         consideration of ethical perspectives" (feedback questionnaire,       source 7).
Requests have also been received from clinical       practitioner/teachers to store the podcasts as a resource for teaching       (School of Health Sciences, Waterford Institute of Technology) and from a       worker for a mental health and well-being community centre in Australia       that provides resources, support and information to people suffering from       depression.
General Public     The lectures and downloads, as well as the art exhibition, have impacted       beneficially on a wider public.
Feedback questionnaires received from       those downloading lectures include one person describing themself as "recovered,         medication free, from bipolar disorder with schizo-affective side         issues" and another as "ex-patient, poet and artist".
The       former states that it was "fascinating to see how "diagnosis" changed         [and] assumptions differed" over time, adding: "Those in         distress have been habitually mistreated and socially controlled, set         apart and deprived of human rights.
Anything that shows this to a wider         audience, and helps to set a gold standard of holistic person centred         support has got to be good" (source 7).
The latter notes how the       research put mental disturbance into perspective because "history         shows the benefit of returning to a humanitarian perspective and         foundation for all interaction rather than a purely clinical approach"       (source 7).
One family member simply appreciates the lecture because of       depression in his family: "my daughter walks with the black dog"       (source 7).
There have been 518 lecture downloads since 2007 from around       the world (source 6).
The `Before Depression' exhibition, 18th-Century Blues, took place at the       Shipley Gallery, Gateshead, between June and August 2008 to very positive       reviews and was visited by an unusually large number of people &#8212; 8,344,       representing a 39% increase on the same period in 2007.
Quotations from       the visitors' book include various testimonies to the impact of this       exhibition and, implicitly, of the work behind it: "A timely         examination of depression which is often thought of as a modern disease"       (source 5), and "A subject which affects so many; it is a show which         illustrates how wide depression was, even in earlier times.... A         thoughtful, insightful exhibition" (source 5).
The project and       exhibition remain in the public domain through an on-line blog entitled       `Stay on Top; Coping with Depression', which encourages its readers to       visit the website, download the podcasts and view the exhibition catalogue       in order to `[discover] how professional anti-depression therapies have       radically evolved, changed and contradicted each other over the last 150       years' and to `[unearth] long-forgotten experience-based tips [...] still       worth considering' (source 5).
In a review in The Tablet, the author       testified to the impact of the exhibition: "This is a comforting show,         not just because of geniuses it fields on the side of depression, but         because of the refreshing glimpse it offers of an age of melancholic         diversity" (2 August 2008, source 5).
An additional benefit of the exhibition was for the Shipley Gallery       itself, whose then curator, confirms not only the rise in visitor numbers       and national reviews in The Times and The Guardian (source 5), but that       loans to a small regional centre from such major galleries as the British       Museum, the V&amp;A, the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery,       Tate Britain and the Wellcome Library would not have been possible without       the academic partnership, and intellectual underpinning, of the research       group (source 2).
Arts Therapy     The impact on the sphere of arts therapy has been through       Wetherall-Dickson's work on a pilot collaboration between LAUNCHPAD       (mental health service users' information hub), Tender Buttons       (theatre-as-therapy group) and Tyne, Wear and Esk Valley Early       Intervention Psychosis Team.
Wetherall-Dickson organised and led a one-day       workshop entitled `Listen Here' (28 February 2013), the purpose of which       was to connect academic research on the nature and treatment of mental       illness with practice-based approaches and personal testimonies (source       7).
The event received overwhelmingly positive feedback, including       comments from mental health professionals ("how impressed I was by the         event and interested to see how the discussion between The Arts and         Mental Health continues in the region", source 4) and members of the       public ("it helped in `Expanding my knowledge of the benefits (and         real need) for self-knowledge, creative expression in connection with         physical and mental health", source 7).
The event is part of a more       sustained collaborative project seeking to understand mental illness as       something more than a mere diagnostic label indicating a broken       individual.
The project will be a point of entry into discussions about       theory, contemporary culture and everyday life, with the findings being       co-produced by practitioners and patients.
