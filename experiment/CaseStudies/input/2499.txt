Economic benefits derived from the MTEM Limited spin-off company     Pathway: The successful creation of MTEM Limited in November 2004       [A] (funded by &#163;7.4M from three equal investors: HitecVision,       Energy Ventures, and Scottish Equity Partners) was a direct result of the       initial research and subsequent Proof of Concept work by the Edinburgh       research team.
In 2007 PGS acquired MTEM Limited for $275M and in August       2012 the company became PGS EM Limited [A].
Evidence of the use,       application and development by PGS of the MTEM approach, with extensive       citation of the underlying research basis, can be found on the PGS website       and in PGS technical documents [B].
Over the period January 2008 &#8212;       July 2013, MTEM Limited / PGS EM Limited has provided three principal       economic benefits:             Provision of employment in the Edinburgh office.
The undertaking of important commercial test studies of the MTEM         method.
An MTEM survey conducted in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast         of Tunisia in 2008 on behalf of ENI (Italy) showed a resistive target         that was drilled immediately, and confirmed the presence of         hydrocarbons, as described in subsequent publicly available workshop         proceedings [C].
Other offshore surveys over the period 2008 &#8212;         June 2013 have shown that apparently promising reservoirs were not         resistive and thus not worth drilling.
Land surveys over the same period         were undertaken in India and over the Athabasca tar sands in Canada, as         stated by the President of PGS EM Limited [B].
The marine MTEM         system was also used in 2008 over a number of currently producing North         Sea fields, including the Harding Field in the UK sector, then owned by         BP and Maersk, a repeat of a survey performed in 2007 [D].
PGS has invested heavily in R+D related to MTEM technology since         2008, with particular emphasis on the development of a fully-towed         system for marine applications.
The 2012 PGS annual report indicates a         total R+D spend across the whole company of $38.3M.
Significance and reach:             Over the period January 2008 &#8212; December 2012 there were between 25         and 49 MTEM Limited employees in the Edinburgh office, which continues         to undertake much of the R+D work.
Over this period we estimate that         approximately 180 man-years of employment have been undertaken in         Edinburgh, with indicative staffing cost figures in excess of $15M, as         evidenced in the published company accounts [E].
Furthermore,         many former employees at Edinburgh have moved to jobs in PGS's offices         in Oslo and Weybridge to work on the development, operation, and         marketing of MTEM technology.
The 2008 Tunisian application demonstrated the potential of the MTEM         method to identify hydrocarbons before drilling.
The results of this         important commercial application were acknowledged by the oil company         ENI (Italy) in 2010 workshop proceedings stating that: "this           represents a first important result that seems to confirm the value of           MTEM methodology for relatively deep hydrocarbon exploration purposes"         [B].
The 2008 Harding study established that the MTEM method has the         potential to monitor the production of hydrocarbons in a producing         field, showing where hydrocarbons are being produced, and where         by-passed hydrocarbons remain.
This is very important for the production         of remaining hydrocarbons in the North Sea, where about one third of the         producible reserves remain in-place.
The Harding test established the         method potential with a key client (BP) and so is a key commercial         milestone for PGS, now used as part of its marketing [D].
Research output [4], Section 3 was co-authored by a Geophysical Advisor         at BP and all the claims in that paper were approved by BP before         publication, including the statement: "The results indicate that the           multi-transient electromagnetic method is suitable for exploration,           appraisal, and monitoring hydrocarbon production" [F].
In Oct 2012, PGS announced the successful validation of a fully towed         streamer electromagnetic system [G], which will considerably         reduce acquisition costs for EM data.
