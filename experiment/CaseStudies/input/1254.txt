     Saul's work on this subject has reached large audiences due to the blog What         is it Like to be a Woman in Philosophy?
(up to 25,000 hits/day);       Saul's talks to Philosophy Departments on the topic; and Saul's       discussions of her work with philosophers around the world.

Moreover, the impact is also beginning to reach beyond       Philosophy, via international media attention.
Impact on practices in Philosophy            The British Philosophical Association is in the process of producing         Best Practice Guidelines, where Saul's work is playing a central role in         shaping the guidelines on sexual harassment and relationships with         students.
The American Philosophical Association has founded a task force on         Sexual Harassment in Philosophy, where Saul was a consultant on the         founding of this task force.
[S3]       The American Philosophical Association is setting up a program of site         visits to improve the climate for women in philosophy departments.
This         program makes use of both Saul's blog and her paper.
The program's         Director writes: `Site visit team members are able to refer to the           anonymous accounts on Jennifer Saul's blog without needing to point to           particular department members in the particular departments being           visited.
For instance, I recently was invited to give a keynote           address entitled, "Women in Philosophy: Why so Few?"
at a large U.S.           philosophy department.
As part of this presentation I devoted several           PowerPoint slides to a case described on Jennifer Saul's blog.
When           talking about how best to respond to sexual harassment, I was also           able to reference Jennifer Saul's paper on sexual harassment.'
[S2]       The American Philosophical Association is drawing up best practice         guidelines on sexual harassment, making extensive use of Saul's work,         which is quoted repeatedly in the current drafts of these guidelines and         which has been cited as crucial to their development.
[S3]       Saul has confidentially consulted on sexual harassment issues in         philosophy departments in the US (4 departments), UK (2 departments),         Australia (1 department), Spain (1 department) and Norway (1         department).
As a result of What is it Like to Be a Woman in Philosophy?,         many departments have instituted initiatives related to the climate for         women.
For example, Rutgers University Philosophy Department has founded         a Climate Committee, runs regular Climate Surveys, and is starting a         programme of ally training.
[S4]       Scores of individuals have contacted Saul to note the effect of her         work on their thinking.
Two examples: 		       A Professor of Philosophy at SUNY Buffalo, USA: `I have been a           long-time reader of your blog "What It is Like to Be a Woman in           Philosophy."
Its frequent stories about sexual harassment in           philosophy have horrified me.
I believe I have consequently become           more alert to signs of sexual harassment.
I cannot say that I have           prevented or remediated any cases of harassment.
But I hope that my           heightened awareness of its possibility will contribute to reducing           its occurrence in philosophy.'
[S1]       [text removed for publication]         Impact outside philosophy            Saul's work on sexual harassment is shaping the thought of equality         professionals, leading to more attention to early intervention rather         than only to after-the-fact responses to what have become very serious         situations.
The Equalities Adviser at Leicester University writes: `[Saul's]           paper provides the most practical proposals I have come across.
In my           experience by the time I have been involved the damage is well and           truly done.
What [she is] offering are real ways in which most of us,           despite our embarrassment or other fears, can still put into practice.'
Saul has been consulted on a movie script, in which the lead character         is a woman philosopher.
Saul's work has received extensive media coverage, often in very         prominent places.
An interview with Saul (conducted in July 2013) about         this work appeared on the front page of the New York Times [S6].
Two interviews with Saul have appeared in Inside Higher Ed, and         she has also been interviewed by the Times Higher Education           Supplement [S7] and the Chronicle of Higher Education.
The         blog What is it Like to be a Woman in Philosophy?
has been         discussed on the websites Gawker (a popular culture blog) [S8]         and Jezebel (a leading feminist blog) [S9].
Given the breadth of their audiences and the size of readership, it is         clear that Saul's work is impacting on non-philosophers.
