     Taken together, the research outputs detailed in Section 3 have led to a       combination of significant impacts for a range of important beneficiaries,       which can be divided into three main categories.
i) Benefiting the political and legal debate over Lisbon's         ratification within the UK and beyond; while also assisting with the         UK's legal preparations for implementing Lisbon     Within the UK, the research contributed to critical understanding of the       Lisbon Treaty among the country's political leaders.
First, it did so by       helping to inform Parliament's decision about whether or not to ratify         Lisbon at all.
Dougan's analysis of various major EU reforms and       their specific relevance for the UK, as summarised in "Freer than we       were", was quoted (with approval) by Edward Davey MP during a Commons       debate on the European Union (Amendment Bill) which led to the UK's       ratification of Lisbon.
The same paper was also the subject of direct       (critical) correspondence by William Hague MP (then Shadow Foreign       Secretary) in Parliamentary Brief (March 2008 Issue).
Secondly, the research also directly assisted in Whitehall's         preparations for implementing Lisbon.
In November 2009, Dougan was       the primary speaker at the only in-house event organised for the entire       Foreign and Commonwealth Office in preparation for Lisbon's entry into       force.
That event was designed to identify the new Treaty's potential       implications for the UK and to explore the myriad challenges facing civil       servants and diplomats.
The FCO noted that the high turnout for this event       meant that Dougan's work reached a wide audience, who appreciated his       focus on those issues of greatest interest to, and that directly affected       the work of, government policymakers.
Moreover, the summary paper       delivered at this event, drawn directly from Dougan's CMLRev       analysis, was also widely circulated among the UK civil, legal and       diplomatic services - including senior members of the FCO, the UK       Permanent Representation to the EU, and the Cabinet Office.
In other EU Member States, ratification of the Lisbon Treaty caused       problems more in the judicial than in the parliamentary context: legal         challenges were brought to Lisbon's compatibility with national         constitutions as concerns the extent to which it had created a new       federal entity which threatened Member State sovereignty.
In its 2009       ruling on the constitutionality of the Lisbon Treaty, the Latvian       Constitutional Court cited "Winning Minds, Not Hearts" as direct authority       for confirming that Lisbon did not fundamentally change the legal       character of the EU, nor the essential architecture of the EU's judicial       system, thus supporting the court's decision that Lisbon's ratification       would not be incompatible with the Latvian constitution.
"Winning Minds, Not Hearts" has also informed senior judicial         understanding of other Lisbon reforms particularly at the Court of       Justice of the European Union: e.g.
it was cited by Advocate General       Trstenjak in the landmark NS case, as regards interpretation of       the new Protocol on application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights to       Poland and the United Kingdom; and by Advocate General Kokott in the       equally important Inuit dispute, as representing the current state       of scientific opinion, in the English-language scholarship, concerning       Lisbon's impact upon the access to justice of individual citizens directly       before the EU courts.
ii) Benefiting Whitehall's understanding and Parliament's scrutiny of         the EU Act 2011     In late 2010, Dougan and Gordon submitted Written Evidence to the         European Scrutiny Committee of the House of Commons for the purposes of         its inquiry into the newly published EU Bill.
Evidence concerning       Part 3 of the EU Bill, concerned with the impact of the draft legislation       upon the fundamental UK constitutional principle of parliamentary       sovereignty, was cited and discussed by the Committee in its final report.
It was also cited, as making a "pretty powerful statement", by Wayne David       MP during the plenary debate in the House of Commons.
Moreover, evidence concerning Part 1 of the EU Bill, concerned with the       legal and political problems associated with introducing a system of       "referendum locks" on a wide range of EU matters, was described as       "particularly useful" by the Committee and is cited repeatedly and       extensively in its final report.
One point of particular influence         concerned the authors' unique research insight that there were       potential loopholes in the system of public and parliamentary control       provided for under the EU Bill.
Based on those research findings, the       Committee specifically recommended amending the Bill so as to close those       very loopholes.
That aspect of the evidence was also highlighted during       plenary debates in the House of Commons by both Emma Reynolds MP and       William Cash MP.
In Autumn 2010, Dougan was invited by the Foreign and Commonwealth         Office to take part in a closed roundtable discussion of academics       and NGOs aimed at informing the department's understanding of the detailed       provisions and broader implications of the EU Bill.
In March 2011, Dougan       was also invited by The Constitution Trust to speak about the EU Bill to       the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Constitution (a regular       meeting of parliamentarians from the House of Commons, the House of Lords       and also the European Parliament to discuss issues of major constitutional       concern): summarising the authors' written evidence to the European       Scrutiny Committee, as well as answering questions from the various       parliamentary attendees, Dougan here sought to inform lawmakers' critical       understanding of the EU Bill at a key stage during its passage through the       Commons and shortly before its consideration by the Lords.
iii) Benefiting the political and legal debate within Parliament over         the Fiscal Compact, as regards its relationship to existing EU / UK law,         and its broader future implications     In early 2012, Dougan and Gordon submitted Written Evidence to the         European Scrutiny Committee of the House of Commons, for its public         inquiry into resolution of the Eurozone crisis.
Dougan was also       among a small number of experts invited to give Oral Evidence to       the Committee at a public evidence session.
That evidence was cited repeatedly and extensively by the Committee in       its final Report.
In particular, the authors' research findings         directly informed the Committee's critical evaluation of crucial but         deeply contested constitutional questions such as: whether the       Commission's roles under the Fiscal Compact were compatible with EU law;       whether the EU Courts could legitimately be granted jurisdiction over the       Fiscal Compact; and whether the UK had any legal grounds for objecting to       the Fiscal Compact as a matter of EU law.
The authors' evidence was also       directly cited by David Lidington MP (Minister of State for Europe) during       an emergency House of Commons debate on the Fiscal Compact, as well as       during the Minister's own evidence to the European Scrutiny Committee.
After the adoption of the Fiscal Compact, the prospect of further EU       constitutional reform prompted a broad political debate about the UK's       future place within/relationship to the rapidly evolving EU legal       landscape.
In March 2012, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House         of Commons launched a major inquiry into UK Government policy on the         future of the European Union in the light of the "December veto".
Dougan and Gordon submitted Written Evidence to that inquiry; the       Committee itself solicited further views from Dougan and Gordon as the       inquiry progressed.
Once again, that evidence was cited repeatedly in the final report       of the Foreign Affairs Committee - the authors' research findings serving       directly to inform the Committee's analysis and evaluation of key issues       such as: the degree to which the legal obligations contained in the EU Act       may have influenced the Government's decision to exercise its veto over       amendments to the EU Treaties; how far the EU Act should be seen as a       watershed in the UK's policy towards the EU; and the complex legal issues       raised by the relationship between the EU Treaties and the Fiscal Compact.
On that last point, Dougan and Gordon were specifically credited for       having brought to the Committee's attention the highly pertinent       implications to be drawn from the recent Pringle ruling of the       European Court of Justice (Case C-370/12; Judgment of 27 November 2012),       which confirmed the authors' interpretation of the legal relationship       between the Fiscal Compact and the post-Lisbon EU legal order, as they had       previously proposed to the European Scrutiny Committee.
Moreover, in his January 2013 keynote speech on the future of UK-EU       relations, the Prime Minister called for a debate about the         possibilities for greater flexibility in the terms of EU membership.
In February 2013, Dougan was invited to speak on the legal framework for       facilitating such greater flexibility within the EU legal order at a closed-door,         high-level policy forum on The Future of Europe organised by       Wilton Park (an agency of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office).
That event       was attended by politicians, political advisors, diplomats and political       commentators from the UK and across the EU as well as the USA.
Dougan       presented the paper subsequently published in CMLRev as "What do       we want?".
His presentation was followed by a plenary Q&amp;A session in       which attendees explored further the various legal and policy issues       raised by Dougan's analysis of the Prime Minister's speech and the       prospects for more flexible EU policymaking.
