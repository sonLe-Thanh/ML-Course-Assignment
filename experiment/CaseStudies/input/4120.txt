     The research has led to changes in national policy and benefits to       national practice between 2008 and 2013, by contributing to a better       understanding of deficiencies in care and both developing and testing       methods which have improved delivery of prehospital care.
It has improved       working practices of ambulance services leading to better care for       patients and increased performance measurement tools for commissioners of       ambulance services and regulators.
Service users, the public and health       practitioners have been involved in the conception, design and       dissemination of the work which has been undertaken in collaboration with       East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) NHS Trust and all ambulance       services in England.
Internationally, we have been co-investigators in the first randomised         controlled trial worldwide published in 2013 examining the feasibility         and safety of ultra-acute treatment of stroke in an ambulance, with         paramedics assessing, randomising, consenting and treating patients with         nitroglycerin prior to admission to a stroke unit for definitive         treatment.6 Our work2 has also been recognised by         the research councils of Australia and New Zealand.
The initial impact of our work was nationally in England with the our         published work to develop and pilot national prehospital clinical         quality indicators for ambulance services for the first time.7         This was undertaken with the wider support of stakeholders including         chief executives, clinical directors and clinical governance (quality)         leads of National Health Service (NHS) ambulance services throughout         England.8 The quality indicators have been informed by our         research on primary care indicators (the Quality and Outcomes Framework)         and our research showing specific deficiencies in care, for example in         pain assessment and treatment.1        We directly influenced the introduction of clinical quality indicators         for ambulance services7 into national regulatory frameworks         for the NHS under the auspices of the health regulator, the Care Quality         Commission.9 We have published our research which shows the         method of development and presentation of indicators.
This is the first         national clinical indicator set for ambulance services which has enabled         national benchmarking, better regulation of ambulance services and has         raised the quality of performance of ambulance services as evidenced in         the latest report of National Clinical Indicators.10        A key benefit for patients, practitioners and services nationally has         been our data showing demonstrable improvement in clinical care         delivered by paramedics for heart attack (measured as an improvement in         national performance in the care bundle for heart attack comprising         provision of critical-to-quality measures including aspirin, nitrate,         pain assessment and pain relief to every patient with heart attack from         43% to 79%), stroke (care bundle comprising Face-Arm-Speech-Time, blood         pressure and blood glucose from 83% to 96%), asthma (care bundle         comprising respiratory rate, peak flow, oxygen saturation and         bronchodilator treatment from 28% to 72%) and diabetes (care bundle         comprising blood glucose before treatment, glucose administration and         direct referral to an appropriate health professional from 92% to 96%)         across all English ambulance services.10 As a result of this         work more patients receive a high standard of care from ambulance         services across England.
The significance of this work was recognised in         a national report published on behalf of the Association of Ambulance         Chief Executives, "Taking Healthcare to the Patient 2" which directly         cited our work as an exemplar of good practice.11        Our work has also had impact regionally with direct and demonstrable         effects on the quality of care delivered to and received by patients.
This has been achieved by raising awareness of deficiencies in care and         improving care for heart disease, stroke, prehospital cannulation and         pain management through quality improvement initiatives.12         The work has been recognised by the National Institute for Health         Research (NIHR) through the NIHR East Midlands Research Design Service         newsletter.13        We have also delivered and demonstrated significant improvements in         care of heart attack and stroke nationally as part of the Ambulance         Services Clinical Quality Initiative.14 We achieved         statistically significant improvements in nine (of 12) participating         trusts in England for the stroke care bundle (a measure of care) and in         nine (of 12) trusts for the AMI care bundle.
Ten (of 12) trusts have         shown a significant improvement in either the stroke or AMI care bundle,         and seven (of 12) have shown significant improvements for both AMI and         stroke.
Overall performance for the care bundle for AMI has increased         nationally in England from 43 to 79 per cent and for stroke from 83 to         96 per cent during the first 18 months of the project.15 This         achievement has received national recognition by the Department of         Health16 as well as being shortlisted for a Health Service         Journal award under the category, `Enhancing care with data and         information management.'
This work has also led to changes in the culture (attitudes and         behaviours) of ambulance clinicians nationally where they have adopted         quality improvement methods and staff as a means of improving care.15
