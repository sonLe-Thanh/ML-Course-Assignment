     From its early genesis in the 1990s, Sussex work on migration and climate       change has had an influence in international policy circles, contributing       to the UNHCR resisting calls to extend international protection to       `climate refugees', and leading to a much more nuanced view of the likely       impact of migration on climate change in the 4th         Assessment Report of the IPCC in 2007, compared to previous reports.
Since 2008, this impact has been consolidated and strengthened through the       direct involvement of Black, Skeldon and Kniveton in a range of       international fora, and through the direct and indirect influence of       Sussex research on the Foresight Migration and Global Environmental         Change report in 2011 (GO-Science 2011; 2012).
Perhaps the most substantial policy change since `climate migration' was       first raised as a matter of concern in the 1980s has been the adoption by       the UNFCCC of the Cancun Adaptation Framework at COP-16 in       December 2010.
In Paragraph 14f of the Framework, the UNFCCC recognised       for the first time that migration represents a potential adaptation       strategy in the face of climate change, in contrast to previous framings       of the issue.
As noted by Warner [see Section 5, C1], this was as a result       of the fact that `empirical research began to accelerate in the mid- to       late 2000s as a crop of systematic investigation and case studies on       environmental change and migration began to be published.
These studies       were complemented by methodological and conceptual development, as well as       analyses of policy implications'.
Sussex research was significantly       represented in this work.
FAQs for policy-makers at COP-16 produced by the       Climate Change, Environment and Migration Alliance (CCEMA) were       co-authored by Kniveton, whilst the COP was informed by a session on the       impact of migration on climate change and development at the 2010 Global       Forum on Migration and Development, also in Mexico, sponsored by the       governments of the UK and Bangladesh, for which Skeldon drafted a joint       UK-Bangladesh background paper.
Before and after COP-16, Sussex research has actively influenced a range       of other national and international actors to approach this issue from a       more-nuanced perspective.
Within the UK, the involvement of Black (as       Chair of the Lead Expert Group, at the invitation of HMG's Chief       Scientific Advisor), as well as Kniveton and Deshingkar in the Foresight       Project of GO-Science on Migration and Global Environmental Change,       resulted in an action plan that included commitments by five international       organisations (World Bank, OECD, UNESCO, OSCE and IOM), three government       departments (DFID, DEFRA, FCO), two research councils (NERC, ESRC) and       Care International [C2].
Additional organisations, including the European       Commission, UNHCR, the UK Climate Change and Migration Coalition, the       Global Forum on Migration and Development and UNICEF, have since used the       research to implement policy change, in part responding to extensive media       coverage of the report [C3].
Thus:            DFID has used the report's findings to promote action at the national         level in several developing countries.
A follow-up workshop in Ghana in         March 2012 led to an agreement with the UN Resident Representative and         the Government of Norway to launch targeted assessment and support to         the Government of Ghana on issues of flooding, disaster risk reduction         and practical contingency planning with community groups and the Mayor's         office in slums, initially in Accra but planned to extend to other major         urban areas in the country [C4 &amp; C7].
Following the presentation of findings by Black there in December         2011, the World Bank commissioned six further regional reports on the         topic, including two from Sussex-based authors, to inform their         programming.
Following the presentation of findings by HMG's Chief Scientific         Advisor at the Joint Research Centre of the EU in Brussels, the European         Commission commissioned Black and Banerjee to write a substantive         briefing to inform the development of a new Commission Working Paper on         Migration and Climate Change.
This paper was initiated by the 2010         Stockholm Process on migration but, following an interest in the         adaptation possibilities of migration stressed by Sussex research, it         was put on hold until 2012, when Black and Banerjee were brought in         [C5].
The final working paper [C10] drew significantly on their         research.
Following the presentation of findings by Black at the UNHCR in         November 2011, a commissioned policy paper directly informed the launch         of the Nansen Initiative on Disaster-Induced Cross-Border Displacement,         and was included as an annex to the first meeting of the Initiative's         Consultative Committee, on which Black has been invited to serve by the         Government of Norway [C6].
The UK Climate Change and Migration Coalition has used the Foresight         research in developing a briefing paper for UK NGOs which stresses that         NGO communications on the issue should include migration as a         `legitimate adaptation strategy' and `part of the solution to potential         displacement', a key original finding of Sussex research [C8].
UKCCMC         have also developed a `myth-buster' document drawing on the same         research [C9].
