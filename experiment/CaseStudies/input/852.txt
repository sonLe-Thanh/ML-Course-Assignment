     The above research programme has resulted in three broad areas of impact:     1.
Content of curriculum materials used by physics, chemistry and         biology teachers in their practice     The Interactive Teaching in Science Classrooms e-learning package       was commissioned in 2007 by the then Department for Education and Skills       (DfES) and made available through the National Strategy for Science in       2008.
These research evidence-informed teaching schemes aimed to address       major conceptual areas in physics, chemistry and biology for the 11-16 age       range.
The e-learning package incorporated lesson plans, teaching       strategies and video exemplars which were underpinned by the research [4]       and were funded by [RG4] and [RG5].
Components a, b and c       are evident throughout and the videos include Scott presenting the       research insights.
As an example, the Science Teaching Unit `Forces in       Motion' [A] uses the communicative approaches presented in       Mortimer and Scott [4] throughout (as `Dialogic Hotspots'), to       guide teacher-student dialogue in the classroom.
These curriculum materials were disseminated to science teachers       throughout England by National Strategy consultants and through the (then)       DCSF website.
A Senior Adviser for STEM/Science at the Secondary National       Strategies stated: "The launch of `Interactive teaching in science' was       supported by national training for the 220 local authority science       consultants who were in post at that time (...) the materials were very       well received by both local authority and school colleagues and such was       the effectiveness of the dissemination that demand outstripped       availability."
[B]     Although the National Strategies website closed in June 2011, a number of       the popular teaching resources have remained accessible, and the materials       remain available at the National Archive and the National STEM Centre       (York) [A].

The initial training of science teachers     The research was also instrumental for the Institute of Physics (IoP) and       its Supporting Physics Teaching (SPT) project.
In response to the chronic       shortage of suitably qualified physics teachers in England, the IoP       commissioned [RG2, RG6, RG7] with the aim to develop and       distribute (with training) UK-wide DVDs of materials to support the       teaching of physics to pupils aged 11-16 years, particularly for beginning       science teachers.
Regarding the SPT materials, the significance of the research to their       development and their subsequent impact, the Head of Education (Pre-19)       from the Institute of Physics, states: "The Institute of Physics has used       the expertise of the members of the School of Education for at least the       last ten years...The SPT materials were commissioned by the Institute and       developed by a team that included Phil Scott and was co-led by him in the       early stages....The SPT materials have been distributed to student       teachers of science since 2006 (about 12,000 individuals) and some of the       methods and pedagogy have been widely adopted by teacher trainers."
[C].
In addition, training courses are provided nationally for PGCE tutors and       for other Continuing Professional Development (CPD) providers in the use       of SPT materials.
The IoP reports that the SPT materials form the basis of       the approach of the Institute's Stimulating Physics Network (SPN), which       has involved over 20,000 teacher-days of CPD to June 2012.
Independent       evaluation has shown that over 90% of participants in SPN training have       modified their teaching as a result [C].

Professional development programmes for science teachers     `Interactive approaches to teaching and learning forces' is a series of       CPD workshops for practising teachers provided at the National Science       Learning Centre (NSLC) in York, an organisation which engages with over       60% of secondary schools and post-16 colleges across the UK.
During       2008-2010 there were six workshops involving groups of about 30 teachers,       drawn nationally.
In evidencing the role of the research insights drawn       from the research projects [RG1 and RG3] for these       workshops, an Associate Director from the NSLC stated, "The research from       the University of Leeds has not only informed the CPD experiences, there       has also been direct input into courses and evaluation."
[D].
As evidence of the research changing practice, the evaluation of three of       these workshops [RG6] indicates a significant and lasting impact       on participant teachers' pedagogical content knowledge and a positive       impact on pupils' learning in comparison with outcomes from normal       teaching [D].
As an example, in a `Leading Assessment for       Learning' course in 2010, the NSLC reported that "the teachers were very       impressed with what [Scott] had discussed with them...Dialogic teaching is       now being implemented more in schools as a result."
[D]     Furthermore, the impact from this programme of research also has global       reach.
[RG8] (S-TEAM: Dialogic Inquiry and Science Teaching) is an       EU funded project to develop effective CPD approaches to support       interactive dialogic teaching of science concepts, and associated workshop       materials are being disseminated internationally through the S-TEAM       network and beyond.
During 2008-2011, the research team made 16 international key-note       presentations to disseminate research findings and associated research       evidence-informed materials to mixed audiences of researchers and       practitioners (with 11 by Scott).
In addition, Mortimer (co-author of       outputs [1], [4] and [6]) has made several       presentations of the research (components b and c) to audiences of science       teacher educators and teachers in Brazil.
Arising from these       presentations, various projects were started outside the UK, including,       for example:            Finland.

Approaches to analysing interactions in Norwegian classrooms.
Components (b) and (c) of the research programme have led directly to 6       doctoral studies, 4 of which completed during the assessment period.
The       doctoral students were based in 5 different countries and three of these       former students now occupy positions of influence on in-country reform of       school science education as government officials or teacher educators:            Mohammed Alzaghibi, supervised by Leach and Lewis, completed a study         on teaching/learning about plant nutrition in Saudi schools, 2010, and         is currently working as a government officer in Saudi Arabia.
Since         returning to Saudi Arabia after graduation, he has held various senior         positions where he has used work from strands (b) and (c) in the initial         and in-service training of many hundreds of teachers.
[E]        Nur Jayhan Ahmad, supervised by Leach and Scott, completed a thesis         examining a teaching sequence in the area of electrochemistry in         Malaysia, 2010.
She now works in the Regional Education Centre for         Science And Mathematics (RECSAM) in Malaysia, which serves teachers in         Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand and other countries in the         region.
She has drawn upon insights from strands (b) and (c) in her         development work with science teachers from the region.
Gultekin Cakmakci, supervised by Leach and Donnelly, completed a         thesis on the design and evaluation of a teaching sequence on chemical         kinetics in Turkey, in 2005.
He is now Associate Professor of Science         Education at Hacettepe University, Turkey.
He has drawn upon strands (b)         and (c) to develop and evaluate teaching approaches in the area of         chemical kinetics at university level in Turkey.
He is now involved in a         research study funded by the Scientific and Technological Research         Council of Turkey which draws upon perspectives on teacher-student         interaction (strand c) to support learning about the nature of science         amongst students at grades 6-8.
