     Although an academic text, Wilson's monograph has reached a non-academic       readership.
It has been reviewed in publications for general readers,       including Opera and The Musical Times, whose critic called       it `As accessible as Puccini's music itself...a book that can engage both       scholars and the opera-going public' (Source 2).
The COJ review       also indicated its wide appeal: `it is a compelling book not only for       musicologists and music critics, but for anyone interested in the history       and culture of modern Italy in its European context' (Source 3).
Wilson subsequently reworked research from the monograph in many       high-profile non-academic contexts.
In particular, Wilson has developed a       sustained engagement with the audience of the Royal Opera House.
The       Commissioning Editor (ROH), has commissioned from Wilson a contextual       essay drawing upon her research for the programme of each of the Puccini       operas currently in the ROH's repertoire.
Eight different Puccini operas       have been performed during the census period, some with multiple revivals.
Wilson's essays have appeared in all programmes for all Puccini       productions during this period: no other contributor has written as       regularly for the Puccini programmes.
The Commissioning Editor, Royal Opera House, (Source 4) writes that       Wilson's essays are more authoritative than previous programme essays for       this repertory and confront stereotypes about Puccini.
He argues that her       essays on the historical contexts for the operas help audiences to       understand them and their production styles better, noting that Wilson's       research makes her uniquely placed to provide such context.
In particular,       the Commissioning Editor notes the role Wilson has played in introducing       audiences to less familiar Puccini operas.
This in turn, he argues, has a       knock-on effect, encouraging the public to explore other unfamiliar works.
The Commissioning Editor argues that Wilson's essays both deepen       audiences' engagement with the opera in question and encourage a       heightened sense of participation in operatic culture more broadly.
He       writes: `All this makes for a more involved audience who are able to get       greater benefit from opera in performance: when they learn more, they       enjoy and value the experience and the culture more'.
The essays reach an       audience of mixed age, income bracket and nationality and the       Commissioning Editor explains that Wilson's essays speak equally       effectively to new and long- standing opera-goers.
He emphasises the       engaging nature of Wilson's writing, explaining that readers value its       clarity and the way it communicates in a `direct and non-technical way',       while stressing that the essays also appeal to experienced opera-goers who       value its `informed and thorough approach'.
Finally, the Commissioning       Editor observes that the essays influence the way in which journalists       write in the mainstream press, thus disseminating Wilson's research to an       even larger audience.
Wilson's work has reached a very large number of readers.
71,674       programmes featuring her work were sold during the period 01/01/08 to       31/07/13 (many will have been read by multiple readers).
The figures break       down as follows (Source 5):             La boh&#232;me programme (featuring Wilson's essay `Making the         Rounds'): 25,342 sold.
Tosca (featuring Wilson's `Praise and Hostility'): 20,620.
Madama Butterfly (featuring Wilson's `Heartfelt and Sincere'):         3,860.
La Fanciulla del West (featuring Wilson's `Fanciulla's         Transatlantic Trials'): 3,599.
La rondine (featuring Wilson's `Puccini the Internationalist'):         4,219.
Gianni Schicchi (featuring Wilson's `Gianni Schicchi in         Context'): approx.
2,600.
Il trittico (featuring Wilson's `Il trittico in         Performance'): 4,315.
Turandot (featuring Wilson's `An Appropriate Ending?
'): 7,119.
Wilson's research has had an international reach.
One of the ROH essays       was reprinted in the programme for the Pafos Aphrodite Festival, Cyprus       (1,700 sold: Source 6).
Wilson was also commissioned directly to write       essays for other European opera houses.
Greek National Opera (Source 1)       specified precise sections of Wilson's monograph to be adapted for a       general audience in an essay on Turandot.
A commission on La         boh&#232;me by the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona (Source 7)       demonstrates that Wilson had been selected for her ability to engage       non-specialist readers.
In 2008 Wilson's work featured prominently in BBC celebrations to mark       Puccini's 150th anniversary (see Source 8).
Wilson drew upon       her research in order to confront widespread misconceptions about Puccini       on `Music Matters' and Radio 4's `Puccini: Touched by the Little Finger of       the Almighty', providing audiences with a nuanced understanding of the       composer's cultural significance during his lifetime.
She introduced       audiences to unfamiliar Puccini operas and their staging in a Radio 3       interview about the ROH production of La fanciulla del West and a       Proms pre-performance talk about Il tabarro at the RCM,       subsequently broadcast on Radio 3.
Further activities included a contribution to a Glyndebourne La         boh&#232;me podcast (2012), downloaded by 1,300+ listeners (Source 9) and       a pre-performance talk at ENO on Turandot (2009), attended by 45       people (Source 10).
Wilson reworked material from her monograph in a book       aimed at students and a general audience, Opera: A Beginner's Guide       (Oneworld, 2010), which is held in over 115 non-academic libraries       worldwide (Source 11) and has been recorded as an audiobook.
