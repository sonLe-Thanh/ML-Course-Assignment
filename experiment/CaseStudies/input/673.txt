     Process of dissemination     Two papers were published high-impact international peer reviewed       journals (British Journal of         Health Psychology and Health Psychology), and papers were       presented at the Appearance         Matters conference (that attracts both academics and health care       professionals) in July 2010 and       July 2012.
This led to contacts from academics and health professionals       from the UK and USA as       well as significant media interest (see below).
The work was reported in       full in a number of health-       related websites (see below) and in newspaper articles (e.g.
The         Sentinel) and magazines (e.g.
Marie Claire).
A report on both studies was passed to Stoke Primary       Care Trust (who had funded       the work) and we discussed the applications of the work with them.
As part       of the report we       produced a list of recommendations for practice.
Data from the research were also disseminated through workshops with       health professionals       engaged in smoking cessation within a 30 mile radius of Stoke on Trent in       September 2010 and       March 2011 at Staffordshire University, and through a session at the Royal       Free hospital in London       in May 2013.
These sessions incorporated details of psychological       underpinnings of the technique,       and led to several new links between us and local stop smoking services.
We trained stop smoking       staff from Staffordshire County Council and South Staffordshire Primary       Care Trust (PCT) in how       to use the technology, which is now incorporated into their routine       practice.
We have discussed       with them how to use this most effectively, based on our research       findings, and have carried out an       evaluation of their stop smoking services, including their use of this       software.
Who has benefitted?
63 Health Professionals involved in smoking cessation (smoking         cessation advisors,         consultants and public health professionals, clinical psychologists, and         a pharmacist) have         attended research dissemination workshops at Staffordshire University,         Staffordshire         County Council, and at the Royal Free hospital.
249 smokers have been exposed to the software as part of the research,         and more than         4,200 through South Staffordshire Stop Smoking Services.
Groups developing smoking-related interventions and needing evidence         on whether to         incorporate an appearance-related element (such as Kick Butt).
95 health psychology trainees at Staffordshire University, and Deakin         University, Melbourne         have been taught about the research intervention.
Aprilage Inc. (distributers of morphing software used in         studies).
How have they benefitted?
People running Stop Smoking Services in Staffordshire and across the UK       have benefitted by       being made aware of the potential effectiveness of facial morphing       software and being trained how       to use it most effectively.
Smokers around Staffordshire have also       benefitted since this software is       now used as part of their package of stop smoking materials.
We have       demonstrated statistically       significant increases in quit rates in these smokers in follow-up research       studies, and anecdotal       reports from stop smoking services in these areas suggest that our       training has enabled stop       smoking workers to increase their clinical effectiveness.
Our work is used       as part of the evidence       base for Operation Smokestorm (used by more than 100 schools in       the UK) to provide a rationale       for an appearance focus in stop smoking materials.
Health psychology       trainees and other health       professionals have also benefitted from learning about the psychological       underpinnings of       appearance-related interventions based on our research.
Aprilage Inc.       have benefitted through       research evidence supporting effectiveness of software.

Evidence             Aprilage Inc. use our research as one of the key elements of         the evidence base for         effectiveness of their age-appearance software and cite Staffordshire         University as their         key academic source on www.april.com.
The developers of the Operation Smokestorm resource cite our         research as evidence for         effectiveness of age-appearance interventions and for incorporating         these into the resource         aimed at young people.
