     Archard's research underpins the recommendations in Chapter 2 of the Critical         Care Decisions report and informs its overall recommendations on       palliative care and involving parents in decision-making.
Before the report was published, clinical care of extremely premature       babies in 222 UK neonatal units, and information given to parents, varied       greatly at different hospitals.
The report's guidelines have led to much       more consistent practice.
Although non-mandatory, the guidelines have       during 2007-2013 become universally used as the framework for practice       across the NHS, as one neonatal consultant attests: `when it comes to       premature babies ... most decisions are based on guidelines from the       Nuffield Council on Bioethics' (Telegraph 29/04/2012).
Indeed, the       2011 BBC2 documentary 23 Week Babies: The Price of Life called the       report `the Bible' on prematurity.
The report's guidelines have shaped       clinical practice so pervasively by providing the basis for successive       further sets of medical guidelines.
This happened as follows.
At the end of 2006 the report was favourably received by the medical       community (The Lancet editorial of 25/11/2006 called the report       `thoughtful, sensitive, and sensible') and other bodies including the       Church of England House of Bishops.
Early Day Motion 122, tabled by MP       Kevin Barron and signed by over 46 MPs in the 2006-7 British Parliamentary       session, declared: `this House welcomes the report by the Nuffield Council       on Bioethics on critical care decisions...'     The Nuffield report presented its recommendations as a basis on which       organisations that govern the medical profession should develop guidelines       on the care of extremely premature babies.
In response:            In Oct 2008 the British Association of Perinatal Medicine (BAPM)         published a framework for clinical practice for Management of Babies           Born Extremely Preterm.
Citing the Nuffield report (Ref.
3, p. 1,         p. 4), the framework's week-by-week guidelines (pp.
2-3) reflect those         of the Nuffield report.
The framework is generally followed across the         NHS (as attested, e.g., in the Daily Mail 10/09/2009).
In 2008 the Neonatal Taskforce was established, made up of         practitioners across the NHS and members of special care baby charity         Bliss, supported by the Department of Health.
The Taskforce published         the first NHS-wide comprehensive framework for improving neonatal         services (Toolkit for High Quality Neonatal Services, 2009; Ref.
4).
The Toolkit states: `Recommendations for the care of babies born at         the threshold of viability, such as those produced by BAPM, should         inform local guidelines' (Ref.
4, p. 88).
In 2009 Bliss was granted Department of Health funding to produce         guidance for parents to support decisions around the management of         extremely premature birth.
This resulted in a booklet for families, Making           Critical Care Decisions for Your Baby (2010, updated, 2011), now         used across the NHS for involving parents in decision-making.
As Bliss         acknowledge (at www.bliss.org.uk/improving-care/professional-development/making-critical-care-decisions-for-your-baby/), the         production of this booklet follows the Nuffield report's recommendations         for `partnerships of care' with parents (Critical Care Decisions         8.54).
These recommendations are informed by Archard's principle that         parents' interests, not only the baby's, carry weight.
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) welcomed         the Critical Care Decisions report in a 11/2006 press release:         `These guidelines will help maternity and neonatal staff to make         difficult decisions in consultation with parents, and to provide the         best care available to those that need it' (Ref.
5).
The RCOG         established a working party whose 2010 report Termination of           Pregnancy for Fetal Abnormality incorporates the Nuffield         guidelines on prematurity (Ref.
5, p. 6).
The positive impact of these successive guidelines is shown by the         2009/10 EU benchmarking report by the European Foundation for the Care         of Newborn Infants (EFCNI) (Ref.
6, pp.
84-90).
EFCNI highlights the UK         as one of only two European countries with a national policy on         premature infants (the Toolkit &#8212; enabled by the Nuffield report) and one         of three countries representing best practice in neonatal care (Ref.
6,         esp.
p. 89 and 94-95).
Today, the Nuffield report's conclusions remain widely endorsed in the         medical community: e.g., a 2010 Lancet editorial found that `a recent         study ... underline(s) the validity of the 2006 Nuffield Council on         Bioethics recommendations on resuscitation and care of extremely         premature babies' (The Lancet 1/5/2010).
The Nuffield report has received extensive media coverage.
When it first       appeared coverage followed in the BBC News, CBC News (Canada), New         York Times, Irish Times, Sky News, Australian Broadcast       Corporation and all UK daily newspapers.
To today the report is still       regularly discussed in articles in many UK broadsheets and tabloids (The         Mail, e.g.
10/09/2009, the Mirror, e.g.
09/09/2009).
The       March 2011 BBC2 documentary 23 Week Babies: The Price of Life       (which dubbed the report `the Bible' on prematurity) drew 1.9 million       viewers.
The report receives extensive attention in the virtual sphere.
The       Nuffield web-pages on Critical Care Decisions are widely viewed:       e.g., in 2011 they drew 2,323 visits, plus 1116 downloads of the full       report and 669 downloads of the summary.
Likewise Jan-Jul 2012 saw 1393       visits and 516 report downloads.
This shows the level of public interest       in the report and its beneficial effect on public understanding of care       for extremely premature babies.
Through its contribution to the Nuffield report, Archard's research         has helped to enable healthcare teams, especially maternity and neonatal         staff, to improve care for extremely premature babies, to involve         parents in difficult decisions, and to develop a unified approach to         such care and decision-making.
Archard's research has thus helped UK       health authorities to offer better provision across the UK's 162 neonatal       units and 46 neonatal intensive care units, improving public services in       health and medicine.
Archard's research has thereby contributed to       benefits in well-being for the many families and their babies who are       directly affected by neonatal services &#8212; extremely premature babies       constitute around 1% of newborns in the UK today (so, of 655,357 newborns       in 2006/7 as a sample year, this means 6553 babies).
The reach of these       benefits of Archard's research extends, then, to thousands of babies and       their families and hundreds of hospital staff.
