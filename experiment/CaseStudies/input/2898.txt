     Context       Understanding needs and signposting to local services has been shown by       previous research to improve outcomes and quality of life for stroke       survivors, their carers and families, who want to feel supported in the       long term and have access to the medical, social and emotional support       they require as their needs change over time.
A structured assessment of       people six months after discharge from hospital was one of the 20 Quality       markers in the NHS National Stroke Strategy (2007) [E] but it was not       clear what this assessment should consist of, or who should undertake it.
The CLAHRC developed and supported the implementation of a review tool to       identify needs and signpost to relevant support: the GM-SAT.
Pathway to Impact       We applied our model for implementation of research into practice to       develop the tool.
Specifically we used an iterative and reflective         approach to develop the tool via workshops, consultations with       staff, patients and carers and literature reviews.
As a result, the tool       has a holistic focus and is designed for use by a range of staff, not only       those with clinical qualifications.
This work was carried out by a multi-professional         team with designated roles to support the process and included a       senior NHS consultant (Tyrrell), university academics (Boaden) and a       knowledge transfer associate (Rothwell).
We deliberately designed the       model to be as flexible as possible, with the details determined by       facilitators at a local level, depending upon their assessment of the         local context.
We also ensure that we embedded evaluation and         learning to ensure that research continues to be developed.
What is the tool?
GM-SAT is a simple, free to use, evidence-based assessment tool used to       identify and address individuals' long term, unmet post-stroke needs and       can be tailored to reflect local care pathways, services and resources       available via health and social care and the third sector.
It was       developed by the CLAHRC and has subsequently been implemented across       England.
GM-SAT provides everything needed to undertake a six-month       review, from the questions to ask within the review, through to       documentation for recording and communicating review outcomes to other       professionals involved in an individual's care [D].
It encompasses a wide       variety of potential post-stroke care needs from medication management and       secondary prevention through to mood and fatigue, including those required       by the Care Quality Commission's Stroke Services Review and the Department       of Health's Accelerating Stroke Improvement Programme (2010/11), as well       as the NHS National Stroke Strategy.
The former National Clinical Lead for       the NHS Stroke Improvement Programme [E] has commented on the tool: "The         tool rapidly became a key element in responding to the challenge set out         in the National Stroke Strategy to take stroke seriously and start the         process of change, so that outcomes for people with stroke can be         improved.
In particular, it provided an off-the-peg, validated framework         for assessing peoples' needs at 6 months after stroke, as mandated by         the Stroke Strategy."
What are the benefits of using the tool?
The benefits of using the tool are for patients and their carers, feeling       supported in the long term, and having access to the medical, social and       emotional support they require.
GM-SAT has achieved significant reach       across England, being used in over a quarter of all services, because of       its acceptability to the wide range of services and professionals involved       in providing post-stroke care, who cite a number of features influencing       its uptake [A,B]:            It is based on evidence and aligns with national clinical guidelines,         which is important for users: "GM-SAT was the best choice to meet the           requirements of National guidelines and commissioners of service".
(Stroke Occupational Therapist).
It was developed and tested by the CLAHRC and is therefore fit for         purpose, which provides users with confidence in the tool.
A formal evaluation has been published.
We worked locally in Greater         Manchester and nationally with The           Stroke Association (SA) to pilot use of the GM-SAT by Stroke         Coordinators employed by TSA, and the evaluation of this pilot         demonstrated patient benefit [A]: Patients answered the question, `what         was good about the review?'
"The fact that at last someone was concerned about how I was going           on after leaving hospital";       "Being able to discuss things with someone who understands how the           stroke affects and changes a person and could help and advise on all           these points";        "This review has helped me to channel my thoughts as to where to go           from here, prompting some good ideas as to how to move forwards."
The long-term impact on patient outcomes would be more complex and         resource intensive to establish formally, but the inclusion of a review         in national strategy and guidance presupposes that it will benefit         patients.
The tool is now being used through the SA to identify patients with         specific needs to participate in future research programmes,         demonstrating the research-implementation-research cycle that         characterises the CLAHRC.
The comprehensive, tool covers health and social care needs, which         allows patients to be assessed in a holistic sense.
They can then be         appropriately managed and referred on to third parties where appropriate         [B].
Non-specialists can use the tool, and once the results are available,         this means that clinical staff have updated information available to         them, without having to conduct lengthy consultations.
Unmet needs are         therefore more likely to be diagnosed and met [B].
Where and how is GM-SAT being used?
The tool was first piloted in Greater Manchester in 2009 and has       subsequently spread to a wider footprint [B] since becoming freely       available in 2010.
It is used for:            Demonstrating the need for, and then carrying out, 6-month reviews         post-stroke, as recommended by NICE guidance (Clinical Commissioning         groups (CCGs), community providers and NHS Foundation Trusts (FTs)         across London, Nottingham, and the North and East of England)       Assessing patients with other long-term conditions       Input to long-term community care planning where unmet needs are used         in audit to identify needs, stroke prevention issues and for feedback to         commissioners [B]       Continuing professional development for practitioners through         development of competencies related to the domains within the tool       Providing consistency of care across an area (Yorkshire and Humber)         through the incorporation of the tool into an IT system used by primary         and community care providers (TPP SystmOne) which means that it is tied         into the clinical record, accessible to multiple practitioners and part         of normal practice [B]       Provision of post-stroke Information and Advice Services by the Stroke         Association, who currently provide services to over 35,000 stroke         patients through 24 services across England and have to date carried out         approximately 4000 reviews.
The Chief Executive of the Stroke         Association [F] writes "As a patient advocacy organization, we are           clear that what is required 6 months post-stroke is a comprehensive           assessment which includes elements identified by stroke survivors and           their families, and GM-SAT provides this.
As a result GM-SAT is the           only tool the Stroke Association offers as part of its commissioned           provision for 6 month post stroke assessments across the UK."
It has been cited as a key output from CLAHRC in the NIHR's Annual Report       for 2011 [C].
