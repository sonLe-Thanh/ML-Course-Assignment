     The University of Southampton's research on statistical modelling for       migration, and on       producing accurate population estimates and projections, has improved the       daily working methods       of public bodies that rely on population statistics in their forecasts and       decision-making, ultimately       affecting the users of public services all across the UK.
The team has       shown how data limitations       can be overcome by using statistical modelling to produce more reliable       and detailed migration       estimates and forecasts, with associated measures of uncertainty.
They       demonstrated, for       example, how administrative sources like student registers, NHS registers       and National Insurance       data, can be used to supplement traditional survey data used by the ONS.
In the UK, this work has become an integral part of ONS operations.
The       final report       of the Migration Statistics Improvement Programme (ONS 2012a [5.1])       mentions four areas of         improvement which resulted directly from the team's work and       recommendations:            Demographic models for migration and population estimates;       Long-term international immigration estimates;       Measures of uncertainty in population statistics (reported in detail         in ONS 2012b [5.2]); and       Conceptual frameworks.
These methodological changes are of national significance and       increase the national         capability to accurately estimate population at a variety of       geographic levels.
The work on       measuring uncertainty in population estimates has fed into professional       guidelines of the ONS and       its customers, providing the users of public statistics "with better         information regarding the         uncertainty associated with the local authority mid-year estimates"       (ONS 2012b [5.2], p.1).
Here,       the reach and significance of the research impact go far beyond the       methodology of official       statistics, indirectly affecting the national economy and public         sphere.
Good quality population       estimates and projections are crucial for transparent and fair allocation         of public funds in such       areas as social services, education, police, fire and rescue, highway       maintenance, or environment       and culture, where they are explicitly used in many of the allocation       formulae (CLG 2013 [5.3]).
The ONS estimates also serve as benchmarks for calculating standardised       mortality rates, used in       allocating funds to Clinical Commissioning Groups of the National Health       Service (NHS 2013       [5.4]).
To quote the ONS in regard to the conceptual framework developed by       Southampton's       researchers, "[it has benefited] users of population statistics,         including analysts, statisticians,         researchers as well as policy and decision makers), [...] data providers         to understand the context         and uses to which their data are put, [and] producers of population         statistics to provide a basis on         which to prioritise future developments in population statistics, and         communicate latest data and         put data in proper context" (ONS 2012a [5.1], p. 6).
The       framework gives details of the component       parts of the population statistics model, together with the data sources       used to estimate these       parts.
In particular, it examines how individual sources such as the       Census, surveys and       administrative data differ in terms of quality and coverage.
The ONS states that, in relation to Southampton's guidelines and       recommendations which       were implemented to change the current practice in order to meet the       Eurostat requirements for       statistics on international migration, following the MIMOSA project, "for         the first time since the         regulation was introduced, the UK was considered compliant with the         requirements under Article 3         of Regulation 862/2007."
[U1] This meant that the UK could       fulfil its statistical requirements under       EU law, avoiding a potentially significant fine.
Southampton's current work on future migration assumptions has also been       found       "...important to ensure the ongoing relevance and accuracy of the         projections which are used         widely across government for planning and policy making"       [U2] in areas such as fiscal       sustainability, pensions, health and education.
The wider societal impact       is significant, even       notwithstanding the issue of direct allocation of government funds.
Population projections form the       base of forecasts for the economy and public finance prepared by the       Office for Budgetary       Responsibility, analyses of future workforce and pension provision by the       Department for Work and       Pensions, actuarial analysis for the public sector carried out by the       Government Actuary's       Department, or various types of macroeconomic studies by the Bank of       England.
The ONS has described its collaboration with the University of       Southampton as having       made an invaluable contribution to the development of more accurate       population and migration       estimates [U3].
The Southampton team has put the ONS "...in an         excellent position to think about         the gaps and the priorities for the future."
[U4] As part of       a Beyond 2011 programme, the ONS is       working on alternatives to the national Census, including dropping it       altogether in favour of       Southampton's modelling approach to the various data streams to which they       have access.
Southampton's research was already highlighted in a 2009 UK Statistics       Authority report       entitled `Migration Statistics: The way ahead?'
In Part 2 of the       report, it stated: "There is a strong         case for constructing synthetic estimates of migration statistics [...]         Raymer and colleagues at the         University of Southampton have been applying the methods to current UK         and European migration         data.
A shared official and academic programme of such synthetic         estimates should be         considered."
(UK Statistics Authority 2009 [5.5], p. 105).
The current case study presents selected       outcomes of the implementation of this programme in practice within the       REF impact period.
Currently, the Southampton team is looking into impacts of their work on       modelling       migration in Europe, carried out in 2009-2012 in the IMEM project.
In       terms of impact, the research       is directly targeted at the EU-level public statistics (Eurostat) and       decision-making (European       Commission), fulfilling the requirements for harmonised migration       statistics stipulated by recent EU       law.
During the latest meeting of the Eurostat Working Group on Migration       Statistics in 2012, it       was explicitly stated that:     "the research project `Integrated Modelling of European Migration'         (IMEM) by the         University of Southampton could be used as a starting point to develop a         model of intra-EU         migration.
This might provide a useful benchmark to assess the accuracy         of reported         migration flows.
Eurostat reported that it was following this project         with interest, noting         that some aspects of the IMEM project built upon the earlier MIMOSA         project that was         funded by Eurostat."
