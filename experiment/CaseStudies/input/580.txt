     The research has generated impact on coastal management policies through       (1) direct involvement and incorporation into a coastal management plan       and (2) the creation of a dissemination mechanism that has informed the       work of scientists, policymakers and practitioners involved in coastal       management.
Slapton Sands is recognised for its nature conservation and landscape       importance.
The beach is ~5Km long and an arterial road, of major       significance to the local population and economy, runs across the top of       the shingle ridge.
During a series of storms in the winter of 2000/01,       significant damage occurred to the barrier beach and a 250m section of the       road.
This prompted public and media outcry resulting in the formation of       the Slapton Line Partnership (SLP) and commissioning of the comprehensive       evaluation of the issues relating to coastal processes.
The primary       purpose of the study was to determine an appropriate future shoreline       management response.
This study was carried out by Scott Wilson Ltd (since       taken over by URS Infrastructure &amp; Environment UK Limited) in       collaboration with the University of Plymouth and Atlantic Consultants.
As a direct result of Chadwick's work on the Slapton Coastal Zone         Management Study [Source 5.1] the SLP enacted a long-term management       strategy and associated adaptation strategy/activities with the local       community.
Due to the study the SLP were able to secure a &#163;245,000 DEFRA       "pathfinder" grant (through the Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management       Programme) to take the adaptation programme forward.
As a result of these       activities public surveys showed that by 2010 "there was a broader         spread of support for the managed realignment policy (around 80% very or         fairly supportive) ... increased levels of awareness about the future of         the road and policies associated with it...[and]...an increase in those         considering that their views were being taken into account, up by 11%".
[5.2]     During the study Chadwick applied one-line shoreline evolution modelling       for the first time to Slapton Sands which represented a significant step       forward in understanding its contemporary morphological evolution.
Shoreline movement between 1999 and 2003 was modelled using the model       developed by CERG (Chadwick and Van Wellen longshore sediment transport       formula).
The study concluded that although the risk of a breach of the       shingle bank will remain low over the next 30-50 years, future sea-level       rise and increased storminess will increase the rate of erosion and the       risk of a major recession event.
With no intervention measures, it was       anticipated that the barrier beach will eventually be breached forming       tidal inlets.
Throughout the study Chadwick assisted in communicating the       findings fully thorough discussions with the SLP Steering Group, Slapton       Village Council reps and local interest groups and to the general public       at the exhibition of project findings.
URS's Director of Water Resources, Flood &amp; Coastal, [5.3] quantified       the project as costing the company &#163;200k to conduct but worth much more in       terms of demonstrating their commercial competence and continual       improvement.
He financially quantifies the Plymouth contribution as 20%,       but deems this a poor representation of the true value to the study and       company as the wave and sediment modelling for shingle beaches was "at         the heart of the issue" so was of pivotal importance both to the       success of the project and of the future management of the Slapton Line.
Working with Chadwick and others at Plymouth, has enabled URS to win       subsequent contracts via their improved technical excellence [5.3].
Meanwhile for the local community and wildlife the study has had       significant implications.
The Manager of the South Devon's Area of       Outstanding Natural Beauty [5.4] described the study as being vital in       providing a publicly accountable `expert' recommendation to the SLP of a       robust long-term management strategy.
The Coastal Adaptation: Community       Involvement Toolkit V4 [5.2]] states: "Politically it was key that the         policy should be formed from expert and independent sources in a         transparent manner in order for the recommendations to have a chance of         being accepted by the local community."
As a direct result of the       study the SLP management plan (funded by the &#163;245k DEFRA grant) allowed       for public/business communication and adaption, habitat adaption, the       promotion of environmental tourism and re-routing of vital transport       links: "A report looking at all the issues concluded that the best way         forward to preserve the natural features of the area and prolong the         life of the road was to plan for moving the most vulnerable sections         inland as well as maintaining strategically placed mounds of shingle.
In         this way we believe the road will be kept operating for at least 25         further years."
[5.6] The chairing partner of the Slapton Line       Partnership [5.7] said that the study was "a great piece of work,         really effective" and "acted as a catalyst to bring create an         alliance amongst the key partners resulting in incredibly positive         feedback from local businesses, positive engagement from the local         Parish Councils and a positive turnaround in local community views".
The successful work in Slapton Sands established the value of the       underlying model and its more general applicability.
In order to develop       this, Chadwick has been instrumental in the sharing of coastal knowledge       and experience among researchers, practitioners and policy makers, at a       European level with wider global interest.
Chadwick coordinated       (2006-2009) the work package responsible for creating the Coastal Wiki and       for elaborating the Coastal Action Plan as part of the ENCORA [5.8]       networking project (EU 6th Framework Programme Coordination       Action).
ENCORA facilitated sharing of coastal knowledge and experience       among researchers, practitioners and policy makers, to produce a European       wide knowledge base and to make recommendations for critical future       research for coastal zone management.
Under Chadwick's coordination "the Coastal Action Plan was developed         in 2008 during a series of workshops with &gt;100 European coastal and         marine experts.
It contributed to the development of the concept of         coastal observatories and it strongly advocated a concerted European         implementation strategy.
The plan was presented to national and European         funding agencies.
It was directly endorsed by the German research         funding agency, who provided funding for a German coastal observatory         network.
The European Commission incorporated the coastal observatory         concept in the GMES programme and in the GEO programme, which continues         in the EU 2014-2020 programme."
Retired advisor - coastal and marine       management and coastal dynamics (Deltares) [5.5]     An additional output produced under Chadwick's coordination was the Coastal         Wiki [5.9], a professional internet encyclopaedia (written with both       non-experts (policy makers, general public) and experts (scientific       stakeholders, practitioners) in mind, that guarantees high quality       information which highlights relationships, reveals contexts, enhances       feedback and guides users in a simple and natural way through related       topics.
The wiki connects disparate knowledge sources and provides       up-to-date, coherent, reliable and comprehensive information.
In September       2013 it contained ~1858 articles and is continuously updated by authorised       expert users.
The main page has been visited over 270,000 times (Feb 2012)       and the total number of hits to the web site reached over 1 million         per month by March 2011.
HR Wallingford's Technical Director [5.10] took part in the ENCORA       project and also read/authored articles from the coastal wiki.
He states       that ENCORA was helpful for networking, particularly for enabling him to       meet leading European researchers with whom he had not interacted       previously and also that the coastal wiki enabled him to form new ideas       which since 2009 have been taken forward in HR Wallingford's projects (HR       Wallingford's income is made up of 15% research income (mainly RCUK) and       85% consultancy activities).
The Coastal Wiki [5.9] is a valuable resource for all those engaged in       coastal engineering and management.
Hits have steady increased since it       was first launched:        Deltares retired coast/marine adviser [5.6] stated that "the Coastal         Wiki has become a major information source for coastal professionals -         managers, practitioners, consultants, students.
It provides information         on coastal and marine governance issues, it provides good practice         examples and it explains technical issues relevant for coastal and         marine management.
There are more than a million hits each month from         users worldwide.
The Coastal Wiki is recommended as a general         information source for coastal managers on the websites of the European         Commission and DEFRA.
It is largely self-maintaining; it has developed         after ENCORA without any external funding.
Both the number of authorized         contributors and the number of users are steadily increasing.
At         present, an international editorial board of outstanding experts is         reviewing the entire content - more than thousand articles- in order to         ensure the highest quality and reliability.
Chadwick is one of the         editorial board members."
