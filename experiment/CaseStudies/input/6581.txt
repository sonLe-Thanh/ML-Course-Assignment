     The line of research on the development and testing of the       Self-Administered Interview (SAI&#169;) provides a clear example of scientific       research progressing from a controlled lab-environment into an applied       context.
The initial experimental research showed that the SAI&#169;       strengthens episodic memory such that forgetting was reduced, and       individuals were vigilant against different forms of misleading post-event       information.
Based on these findings the Research Team believed the SAI&#169;       had the potential to make a significant beneficial contribution to police       practice, and ultimately to the delivery of justice for witnesses and       victims of crime by virtue of enhancing the investigatory process.
The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) endorsed field trials of       the SAI&#169; in February, 2009, recognising that the forensic implications of       the research for police practice are considerable.
With this backing, we       applied for, and were awarded, a `Follow-on-Funding' grant from the ESRC       (awarded January, 2010).
This enabled us to engage in knowledge-exchange       activities with end-users, and conduct field-trials of the SAI&#169;.
The field       trials were to establish whether the SAI&#169; could demonstrate both practical       and evidential benefits to the police during their enquiries by eliciting       high quality witness accounts.
To attract the attention of UK police forces an extensive       knowledge-exchange strategy with end-users was implemented, which included       disseminating findings at practitioner conferences, in practitioner       magazines, and by creating and promoting a website       (www.selfadministeredinterview.com).
Twenty-seven forces (7 from outside       the UK) are currently involved in the field trials, which commenced in       January 2010.
Feedback from forces participating in the trial has been overwhelmingly       positive.
A quote from an end-user highlights the real-world impact of       this research: "Notably, the SAI is the first empirically-derived         interviewing practice development that has been presented to the police         in almost 20 years, probably the most valuable additional tool placed at         our disposal in the world of investigative interviewing since the         adoption of the `PEACE' model of interviewing in the early 1990s, and         the introduction of the enhanced cognitive interview model."
(Ian       Hynes, Force Specialist Investigative Interview Manager and Advisor,       Greater Manchester Police, UK).
The SAI&#169; has made an important contribution to a number of live       investigations by providing detailed initial accounts, prioritising       witnesses, and facilitating the identification of additional witnesses, in       incidents including serious road-traffic incidents, assaults, robberies,       and a terrorist attack on Norway in June 2011.
Based on the performance of the SAI&#169; in the field trials, some police       forces in the UK and abroad have officially adopted the SAI&#169; as a       permanent force-form, and train all new-recruits in the procedure.
This       demonstrates that in a relatively short time, the SAI&#169; has already had a       significant impact upon policy.
Use of the SAI&#169; procedure, and the       information reported therein, was presented as evidence in court for the       first time in 2011, with good effect and positive feedback.
The field-trials have also generated interest from charities, such as       Victim Support and Roadpeace, the latter of which are actively campaigning       for the SAI&#169; to be standard procedure for obtaining evidence relating to       road-traffic-accidents.
In 2010 the SAI&#169; was used to by two of the world's       largest engineering companies (AMEC and Baker Hughes) to obtain evidence       in Health &amp; Safety Investigations, including two serious incidents on       an off-shore oil-rig.
In summary, 27 forces world-wide are in different stages of       testing/adopting the SAI&#169;.
A survey (Sept 2013) of the forces who first       tested the tool highlighted that:            Greater Manchester Police have fully implemented the SAI as an         official force form and part of operational procedure (1000 officers are         trained in its use).
The Dutch police have approved nation-wide implementation of the SAI         (it is now part of police training).
In Norway the SAI is mentioned in Best Practice Guidelines for         managing eyewitness evidence (issued by the General Prosecutors Office)         (1500 Norwegian officers have been trained to use the SAI).
South Yorkshire Force has been engaged in extensive evaluation across         a range of incidents and is working towards the introduction of the SAI         as good practice across the force.
End-users report the SAI has been deployed in a wide range of incidents       including:            Major incidents involving multiple witnesses including several         murders, shootings and assaults and other major crime incidents       Part of official response strategy for mass witness scenarios         including counter-terrorism, potential public order and security         incidents (e.g.
London Olympics 2012, Party conference)       Fatal road traffic investigations       Policing at an international airport       Eliciting information from initial responders to an incident       Screening large numbers of witnesses for historical investigations          In sum, the SAI&#169; research has produced significant scientific and       societal-level impact.
In direct recognition of these impacts, Dr. Gabbert       was recently awarded an Academic Excellence prize by the International       Investigative Interviewing Research Group in recognition of Outstanding         Achievements in the area of Investigative Interviewing.
