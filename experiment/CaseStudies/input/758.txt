     Cultural cultivation     As Saunders Lewis once noted (The Banned Wireless Talk,       (Caernarvon, 1931), pp.
4-5), a minority language such as Welsh must be       cultivated by original artists if it is to do more than simply survive.
Otherwise, `[i]ts literature will become entirely second-hand and         fifth-rate ... something worse and more tedious than the death of a         language'.
In writing literary texts praised for their originality,       James, Dafydd and Hallam have engaged with readers, listeners and viewers,       working with several festivals, institutions, societies and groups       integral to Welsh language culture.
Public engagement at the National Eisteddfod     In respect of the first impact noted here, the Chief Executive of the       National Eisteddfod (C1) has stated that: `the National Eisteddfod         promotes the Welsh language and its culture like no other event.
The         main literary ceremonies are at the heart of the festival, and the         office of Archdruid is essential to its success, promoting the         Eisteddfod throughout the year.
The support from these three         artists from Swansea University in recent years is therefore striking         and invaluable to Wales' largest cultural event.'
Only writers who have won the Crown, the Chair or the Prose Medal       competitions at the National Eisteddfod can be elected as Archdruid of       Wales.
During the REF census period, Christine James had       previously been part of the Gair am Gelf (A Word about Art) project in       order to raise money for the 2008 National Eisteddfod at Cardiff, during       which she was also resident poet in Y Lle Celf (The Arts Space).
However,       since her `historical' election as Archdruid in 2012 - the first woman and       the first academic to hold this position - James has engaged with the       public by means of talks to various cultural groups across Wales, from       Cardiff to Talsarnau, addressing both female and mixed audiences, but       mostly visiting areas where Welsh is not the main communal language.
She       herself learnt the language and as reported by BBC Cymru/Wales her vision       is to reach out to diverse communities.
She was also the subject of a       special edition of Dechrau Canu, Dechrau Canmol on S4C (28.4.13)       and a special feature on BBC Radio Cymru (28.7.13).
When Fflur Dafydd won the Daniel Owen in 2009, the highlights on the day       attracted 44,000 viewers on S4C, which included an interview with Fflur       Dafydd.
Similarly in 2010, when Tudur Hallam won the Chair competition,       the Eisteddfod's highlights of the day programme was viewed by 49,000       people.
Both ceremonies were also broadcast and televised live.
Interviews       and reports appeared in numerous national and local papers.
Hallam's awdl       was included in the festival's Cyfansoddiadau a Beirniadaethau,       published by the Eisteddfod.
As emphasized above, these ceremonies are       integral to the Eisteddfod's programme and public appeal.
Engaging with the National Library of Wales     In 2011, James contributed a poem on one of the treasures kept at the       National Library of Wales, translated into English and published in a       book, 26 Treasures: 4 National Museums, 104 Objects, 62 Words       (2012), and online at http://www.26treasures.com/wales.
James promoted the project on Pethe on S4C, and in July 2013 was       commissioned by the National Library of Wales to write a new poem for the       Four Ancient Books of Wales Exhibition, while another of her poems,       already published in Rhwng y Llinellau, has also been selected to       feature in the exhibition.
These projects consolidate the creative link       between the UoA and the National Library formed by Fflur Dafydd's Y         Llyfrgell.
The novel and Byd Bach were the subject of a talk       and song event by Dafydd at the Library (27.11.2009), and the subject also       of Y Sioe Gelf (22.11.2009), produced by Cwmni Da for S4C and       filmed at the Library.
Published by Y Lolfa of Tal-y-bont, Y Llyfrgell       quickly became a bestseller.
Wales Literature Exchange selected the novel       for its Bookshelf.
This entailed international promotion and an author       interview in Transcript Magazine, subsequently translated into       French and German for an international audience.
Literature Wales invited       Dafydd to host a literary tour of the National Library (13.7.2012).
Contemplating the novel's popularity, the National Library's Press Officer       (C2) has stated that `Y Llyfrgell has brought the National Library to         the forefront of people's minds in a new and exciting way, and the         literary tour at the Library proved a great success, allowing us to         respond to the public's interest in the novel's relationship with the         building.
Such tours, along with exhibitions such as the Four Ancient         Books and projects such as 26 Treasures, allow us to present our         collections to new audiences.'
Working with diverse institutional and reader groups and Welsh-medium         broadcasters     Y Llyfrgell, produced by Y Lolfa of Tal-y-bont, became the       bestselling Welsh-language book for August 2009 and September 2009 (a       reprint was necessary within a month of its publication).
It subsequently       won the Fiction Bestseller Award at the Trade Publishing Awards 2012,       having sold 3,738 copies.
Sales figures, however, cannot convey how Fflur       Dafydd's work bridges the gap between literature and music.
(Details of       media appearances and past live performances are listed on Dafydd's       web-site.)
According to BBC Radio Cymru's editor (C3): `Fflur Dafydd is         one of BBC Radio Cymru's most played artists.
Her work is an important         contribution to the musical content of the station's programmes, but the         Welsh language itself is also enriched through her songs.'
In June       2012 she was invited by the world-renowned Telegraph Hay Festival to       launch Ffydd Gobaith Cariad in a special concert there at the       Sound Castle, supporting Cerys Matthews (C4).
James' numerous talks, since her appointment as Archdruid were mentioned       above.
Both Dafydd and Hallam too, following their Eisteddfod success,       visited diverse groups to discuss their work, with audience numbers       varying from 10 to 90, including Welsh-medium schools, literary groups and       dinner or cultural societies, from Bangor University to Clwb Cinio       Glannau'r Llwchwr (Loughor Dinner Club).
Both have also appeared on       television and radio programmes (e.g.
Heno, Pethe, Dei         Tomos), including Dafydd's 3 Lle, produced by Apollo for S4C       (21.3.2010).
Since winning the Chair, Hallam as Prifardd (Master Poet) has       also adjudicated for a number of local literary festivals and schools (the       Chaired Eisteddfod of Hendy, Bancffosfelen, Tumble, Llandyfaelog, Ysgol       Gyfun G&#373;yr), helping organisers `to attract competitors from afar'       as stated by the Secretary of the Tumble Chaired Eisteddfod (C5).
Commemoration     One of the largest audiences was at Cymdeithas y Llan a'r Bryn       (20.10.2010), the literary society established by Hywel Teifi Edwards in       Llangennech, the subject of `Ennill Tir' [R5].
The poem commemorates a       much loved national figure and prominent campaigner for the Welsh language       &#8212; a theme also present in Fflur Dafydd's Ffydd Gobaith Cariad,       including the tribute song to Ray Gravell performed at a special tribute       and sell-out concert, `Cofio Grav', at the Lyric Theatre, Carmarthen       (2.3.2008) (C6).
The song was subsequently translated and performed in       English on BBC Radio Wales (2.6.2012).
Both men were truly Welsh greats       and subjects of public commemoration in the media and in their       communities.
Idris Reynolds (C7) noted that ``Ennill Tir' is a beautiful tribute to         a giant of a man who gave so much to the Eisteddfod and to the nation',       and reference to the commemorative value of the awdl was made by       Hywel Francis, MP, in a parliamentary Early Day Motion (8.9.2010) (C8).
Work on an anthology of commemorative verse, Hoff Gerddi Coffa Cymru,       commenced in 2012, published by Gwasg Gomer (2013), and as stated by the       editor, the awdl was the `stimulus' for that book (C9).
In conclusion     Collectively the three artists here have engaged with a variety of fora       in Wales, enriching the lives of readers, listeners and viewers of Welsh       texts, programmes and events, as evidenced by qualitative quotations and       quantitative figures above.
This engagement is truly diverse, ranging from       national festivals and televised interviews attracting large audiences, to       supporting the smallest cultural groups, who are nevertheless important to       their community's Welsh language culture.
In the REF census period, all       three authors have developed their role as academics whose creative       writing impacts on the all important task of cultivating the cultural life       of Welsh.
