     Cockin's research into women's theatre history has been disseminated       through the Ellen Terry and Edith Craig database, and through books and       papers, public talks and a conference which have brought academic and       general audiences together.
This has resulted in impacts for members of       the public (especially those researching family histories), HE college       students and professional actors, from the launch of the database in 2008       to the present.
International reach is indicated by Google Analytics data on the       usage of the online database.
Since its launch, from 2008-13, the resource       has had 9776 visitors from more than 97 different countries,       achieving 70-74% new visits each year.
The international reach is       evidenced by visits to the website from 29 countries in 2008 and 58 to 75       countries in 2009-11.
A key use of the database is by members of the       public researching their family history.
National reach:            Google Analytics data show 447 UK visits to the Ellen Terry and Edith         Craig online database in 2008, rising to between 1026 and 1533 in the         period 2009-11.

Cockin was invited to present on Edith Craig to the actors' union         Equity (Phoenix Theatre Club, London, 12 February 2010) as part of         Lesbian History Month and, as a result, an audience member took part in         the performance of A Pageant of Great Women at Cockin's Pioneer         Players conference (see below; DVD available).
Regionally, Cockin presented to the Historical Association at Hull (18         November 2010) and Grimsby (16 September 2011); and at the Family         History Centre Hull (17 February 2011).
Added evidence of the significance of the impact and the interconnectedness         of original, internationally excellent research and public engagement       is demonstrated by the ripple effect of Cockin's research.
For example,       following a lecture by Cockin on 7 January 2011 at Hull College, a play Suffragette       was written and performed by BTEC Performing Arts students from the       College.
It represented key episodes in the women's suffrage movement,       including a scene in which Edith Craig directs actors in Cicely Hamilton's       A Pageant of Great Women.
Suffragette had a profound effect on many       of the students who were involved or who watched it.
The play was then       performed at The Pioneer Players: Politics and the Art of Theatre, a       conference to mark the centenary of the Pioneer Players, organised by       Cockin at the University of Hull on 7-8 May 2011.
The conference also included an interactive performance of A Pageant         of Great Women, directed by Dr Anna Birch (Royal Conservatoire of       Scotland).
The delegates at the conference and invited non-academic       members of the public (specifically members of Hull Historical       Association, Hull College BTEC Performing Arts students, members of       Equity) as well as University of Hull students were invited to take part       as `great women' in the production.
A Pageant of Great Women was       filmed and is available on DVD with photographs of scenes available at 	  http://www2.hull.ac.uk/fass/english/our-staff/cockin,-prof-katharine/inaugural-lecture-downloads.aspx     Supported by iHull (the University's Institute for Creativity and       Innovation), the filming of the play facilitated the archiving of the       performance and ensures the longevity of the project.
Media reach is evidenced by non-academic articles and interviews:            Article by Simon Stabler in Family History Monthly magazine         (international distribution, Family History News: The Family History         Profile, January 2010; issue 178, p.16).
Cockin was subsequently         contacted by members of the public tracing their family history.

Article by Cockin on the regional significance of the Ellen Terry and         Edith Craig archive for Kent Life (`Queen of the Theatre',         September 2009, pp.

Cockin was interviewed by Aaysa Lodhi in two episodes of `Open Book',         introduced by Mariella Frostrup, Radio 4, 10 July 2011 (10,555,000         listeners to Radio 4 for the quarter ending September 2011).
Cockin provided background information to Jude Kelly for the Radio 4         programme `Leading Ladies' marking the 350th anniversary of         the first English professional actress, 26 Oct 2010) http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vhg2z         (10,319,000 listeners to Radio 4 for the quarter ending December 2010).
Cultural Heritage and Preservation     The AHRC Ellen Terry and Edith Craig Database has had a significant       impact on the National Trust property Smallhythe Place in its       custodianship of the Ellen Terry and Edith Craig archive.
The database is, according to the House Steward, `immensely valuable to       both researchers and staff connected to Smallhythe Place and is used `on a       daily basis; as a basic tool it tells me what material is housed at the       British Library but it is invaluable when staff and volunteers are       carrying out research.'
(see Source 9)     Research enquiries come from a diverse international community, as the       House Steward reports: `There is an increased interest in Ellen Terry and       Edith Craig and I always refer researchers to the database; the fact that       it provides concise descriptions of each item saves me answering endless       emails.'
(see Source 9)     Furthermore, the online database has facilitated an improvement in access       and preservation of the majority of the papers, as confirmed by the House       Steward: `The database has made possible the removal to the British       Library of a large part of our archive, making it more accessible, being       in London, and better housed in terms of conservation conditions' (see       Source 9).
