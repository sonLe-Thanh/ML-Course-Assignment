     The RECOUP Director's work on aid to education had a significant       influence on DFID aid policy       during 2008-13.
In 2005 he conducted, at DFID's invitation, a study which       led to a substantial       increase in British aid to education over subsequent years (3.5) The       details of its impact are       described by Steer and Wathne (2009), as follows: "Professor Colclough of       Cambridge University       was asked to carry out a detailed analysis of the financing needs for       primary education,....to       provide a credible estimate of the financing needs for the other EFA       goals, including lower       secondary, literacy and some estimate of a viable contribution to begin to       rebuild the depleted       higher education sector in Africa.

The result was a joint       DFID/Treasury document From         Commitment to Action: Education (2005) which provided the evidence       base for a substantial       increase in UK aid for education.
This increase was announced by Gordon       Brown and Hilary Benn       in Maputo in the spring of 2006 in the form of a 10-year pledge to provide       &#163;8.5 billion to support       education".....The combination of "high level political will and       pragmatic organisational and         managerial interests was supported by substantive technical         analysis and evidence...
The lack of       any one of these factors would have meant that the announcement -       described by Hilary Benn as       `DFID at its best' &#8212; might never have happened."
Steer and Wathne 2009:25       (5.1) (emphasis in       original).
This increased commitment resulted in UK aid to education       increasing from &#163;360mn in       2007/8 to &#163;625mn in 2011/12 &#8212; an average growth rate of some 15% per year       over the period (UK       Government, 2013: Table 21 (5.2)).
A second study in 2007 (revised in 2011 (3.2)) identified ways in which       aid to education was being       misallocated, and it underpinned a substantial reform in 2008/9 of the       criteria used by DFID for       deciding the distribution of educational aid amongst countries.
In       particular it provided, according to       DFID, "the underpinning analysis which supported DFID in assessing how to       meet its then public       commitment of spending &#163;1 billion on basic education by 2010...
It       provided an initial lens with       which to assess education allocations, and it allowed DFID to identify       where it would be desirable       and feasible to scale up education activity.
The approach was further       refined in DFID's Education       Portfolio Review (2009/10) where `need' (as per the approach in the RECOUP       paper) was weighed       against the potential `effectiveness' of intervening.
DFID's current       spread of education programmes       broadly reflect these deliberations" (memo from DFID Head of Profession       (Education) 6 April 2012       (5.3)).
RECOUP's evidence on returns to education (3.4) influenced the content of       DFID's education       strategy (Learning for All: DFID's education strategy 2010-2015,       DFID 2010) and was used to       support that paper's expressed confidence in the productive value of       education.
It was widely       circulated in DFID and was used by DFID in both internal and external       briefings (as stated in memo       from DFID Head of Profession, 6 April 2012 (5.3))     RECOUP's research on aid to education in India (3.3), helped the DFID       Delhi office in its dialogue       with the Indian government during 2010/11 and formed an input to external       reviews of DFID's aid       impact.
It is judged by DFID India to have been "an immensely influential       article - provided as a       key reading to both the International Development Committee and the       Independent Commission       on Aid Impact during their reviews of DFID India's work in 2011 and 2012       respectively" (memo of       25/04/12 from Senior Education Adviser, DFID, Delhi office (5.4)).
RECOUP's research on disability informed UNESCO's Education for All       Global Monitoring Report       2010: a background paper on India drew on these findings.

Singal's       work was included by       the World Bank in their Inter-Agency Disability Knowledge Base       (2011) for circulation to other UN       and external agencies (5.6) and was featured on the DFID R4D website from       2011       (www.DFID.gov.uk/R4D).
Her open access qualitative training manual (Singal       and Jeffery 2009       (5.7)) was used in Pakistan as the frame for a course organized by the       Human Resource       Development Network/Institute of Rural Management, Islamabad, Feb 9-11,       2009, which included       participants from NGOs, public sector organizations, businesses and       universities.
It provided the       basis for a similar workshop, on "Qualitative Research Methods", conducted       by the Sustainable       Development Policy Research Institute, Islamabad, June 12-13, 2012 (e-m       from Visiting Associate,       Sustainable Development Policy Research Institute, 22-11-12 (5.8)).
RECOUP has influenced DFID thinking on research priorities: the       Director's advice was judged by       DFID to be "valuable and gratefully received....
The contributions made at       the meeting will help       shape the Education Research Group's future research priorities and DFID's       position on post-       primary education" (letter from Senior Research Adviser DFID 11/6/13       (5.9)).
