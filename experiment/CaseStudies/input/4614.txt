     Impact of CRUK publications on committee invitations and development         of clinical trials     Publications [1-4] and press releases in the 1990s importantly led to       Professor Paraskeva being invited onto several UK national research and       trials committees and pharmaceutical scientific advisory committees       (Merck), which organised clinical trials, including: Medical Research       Council (MRC) Molecular and Cellular Medicine Board (1996-1998); MRC       Advisory Board (1998-2003); National Translational Cancer Research Network       (NTRAC) Clinical Study Group (2002-2005); UK Co-ordinating Committee on       Cancer Research (UKCCCR) Sub-Committee on Colorectal Cancer (1996-2001);       National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) Colorectal Clinical Studies       Group (2001-2005); the World Cancer Research Fund International Grant       Panel (2010-date).
Membership of these committees led to Professor Paraskeva's direct       involvement in clinical trials such as the CAPP2 study below.
Aspirin significantly reduces colorectal cancer incidence in HNPCC         hereditary bowel cancer patients (CAPP2 trial) at very high risk of         bowel cancer     Professor Paraskeva was a collaborator and on the Data Monitoring       Committee of an international trial examining aspirin's ability to reduce       bowel cancer incidence in high-risk HNPCC patients published in 2011.
[a]       The study involved 861 people and showed that 600mg of aspirin a day for a       mean of 25 months significantly reduced bowel cancer incidence in carriers       of hereditary bowel cancer.
[a] CAPP2 was the first randomised trial of       aspirin as a chemopreventive agent with cancer as the primary endpoint.
It       is of particular importance since HNPCC is the most common form of       hereditary bowel cancer, affecting thousands of people worldwide, and       provides a basis for recommendation of aspirin chemoprevention in HNPCC       patients as standard of care.
[a] This Lancet publication received       worldwide TV, radio and newspaper exposure.
[b] [c] The Bristol work on       apoptosis as a plausible mechanism for the chemopreventive action of       aspirin,[3] justifying further trials, continues to be cited in journals       such as the Lancet (reference [3]; cited in [d]).
Impact of high dietary fibre on reducing the risk of bowel cancer in         the general population and increasing public awareness     Research from Bristol on dietary fibre and apoptosis [1] [2] has been       cited as a plausible mechanism to support the chemopreventive properties       of fibre and to justify further research (for example, cited in [e]) and       there have been a number of high profile publications reporting that high       dietary fibre is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer ([f],       and papers cited in [f]).
Importantly, the research and subsequent       publicity has also influenced global policy on cancer prevention and major       public health campaigns (five-a-day) and increasing fibre may be       influential in reducing other obesity-related cancers, such as breast       cancer.
[e-j]     Impact of aspirin as an adjuvant therapy for colorectal cancer     The finding that aspirin induced apoptosis in adenoma and cancer cells       led to the proposal that aspirin be used as an adjuvant to treat bowel       cancer and not just in prevention;[3-6] (also see BBA Reviews in Cancer,       2006, 1766,104-19).Two independent epidemiological studies in 2009       and 2012 involving over 2,000 patients have shown that regular       aspirin use after diagnosis of colorectal cancer is associated with lower       risk of colorectal cancer-specific and overall mortality.
Thus aspirin, as       originally hypothesized,[5] [6] shows promise as an adjuvant to cancer       therapy [k] as well as in chemoprevention,[a] and has saved a large number       of lives of patients with bowel cancer.
[k]     Impact of aspirin on saving lives in several major cancers, not just         colorectal cancer       Daily aspirin intake was reported in 2011 to reduce deaths in a       number of other human cancers including brain, oesophageal, lung, prostate       and stomach cancer, as well as colorectal cancer.
The paper concerned       (Lancet, 2011,377,31-41) cites the Elwood 2009 Lancet paper,[d] which in       turn cites the Paraskeva 1996 Cancer Research paper.
[3]     Impact of Bristol publications on national and international public         awareness and public understanding of cancer prevention     The four original publications [1-4] not only led to invitations onto       influential committees (see section 4) and involvement in clinical trials       (as noted above) but also to the Bristol Beating Bowel Cancer (BBBC)       Public Fund Raising Campaign in the late 1990s, run jointly between the       University of Bristol and the Cancer Research Campaign (CRC).
This led to       posters of men's and women's bottoms throughout Bristol and a public       campaign to increase awareness of bowel cancer.
BBBC raised &#163;1.5m of new       money for bowel cancer research, and their appeal was debated favourably       in the Houses of Parliament: House         of Commons Hansard Debates for 6 Jul 1999 (pt 4).
The importance of diet and dietary fibre in cancer prevention generally,       as well as in bowel cancer, was a successful BBBC public awareness       campaign.
Professor Paraskeva has given 6-10 public talks per year on       cancer awareness and cancer prevention for nearly 30 years.
For example,       in 2012-13 two public talks given at Bristol's M Shed and       Watershed both attracted audiences of more than 100.
Every year several       dozen members of the public have tours and cancer prevention talks at the       Bristol Cancer Research UK Laboratories.
International impact of Bristol publications and clinical trials on         public understanding     International and national radio and newspaper coverage was given to the       Bristol fibre and aspirin research publications.
[1-4] The research has led       to a considerable increase in public awareness of the role of diet and       fibre in reducing the risk of bowel cancer and other cancers and has led       to NHS Direct [g] and prestigious US agencies (Mayo Clinic [h] and NIH) to       recommend a high-fibre diet.
The famous `five-a-day' slogan is also linked       to dietary fibre.
The World Cancer Research Fund, a major international       cancer prevention charity, has stated from a recent report that they have       found strong evidence that foods containing dietary fibre decrease the       risk of bowel cancer and they recommend an increase in dietary fibre.
[i]       [j]     Impact of Bristol's Colon Cancer Group publications on clinical trials         development     The original four research papers published by the Bristol Cancer       Research UK Colorectal Cancer Group, showing that butyrate/fibre/aspirin       induces apoptosis in human colorectal cancer and adenoma cells [1-4], have       been cited over 1,000 times and led to more than 60 publications.
They       continue to be cited as evidence in discussions of the case for using       aspirin for bowel cancer prevention (paper 3 cited in Lancet, 2009 [d]),       and in the justification for clinical trials reported above and future       such studies.
