     The research at AU described in section 2 has had a direct impact on       public policy by informing       Government guidance and legislation for local government in England and       Wales, and an indirect       impact on society by enhancing the capacity of town, parish and community       councils to serve their       communities.
In particular, recommendations from research on town and       community councils in       Wales, presented to the Welsh Assembly Government in the `Aberystwyth       Report' [3.5] directly       formed the basis for provisions in the Local Government (Wales) Measure       2011, as acknowledged       in the Explanatory Memorandum for the legislation, and in the report of       the National Assembly for       Wales Legislation Committee examining the Measure:     "The need for new legislation was also informed by research commissioned       by the Assembly       Government into widening participation in local government (culminating in       the publication of       Are we being served?, the Report of the Councillor Commission       Expert Panel Wales) and a       study for the Assembly Government by Aberystwyth University into the role       and functions of       community and town councils in Wales (Research Study into the Role,         Functions and Future         Potential of Community and Town Councils in Wales [the "Aberystwyth       Report"])" [5.1]     "The provisions in Part 7 of the proposed Measure flow from the study       commissioned by the       Assembly Government and undertaken in 2003 by the University of Wales,       Aberystwyth:       Institute of Geography and Earth Sciences into community councils in       Wales, `Research Study       into the Role, Functions and Future Potential of Community and Town       Councils in Wales' ("the       Aberystwyth Report").
This was the first comprehensive review of the work       of community and       town councils in Wales."
[5.2]     "The provisions in Part 7 of the proposed Measure are based on the Aberystwyth         Report, which       was a review of the activities of community councils across Wales       completed in 2003" [5.3]     The provisions introduced by the Local Government (Wales) Measure 2011       included changes to       arrangements for establishing and dissolving town and community councils,       holding community       meetings and polls, reviewing community areas and electoral areas,       co-opting council members       and appointing youth representatives; new powers for the Welsh Government       to award direct       grants to town and community councils, to enforce `charter agreements'       between community       councils and principal authorities, and to introduce an accreditation of       quality scheme for       community councils; and a power for town and community councils to promote       well-being in their       area.
All these provisions follow from research by Aberystwyth University       and have contributed to       the capacity of town and community councils in Wales to serve their       community by providing       greater stability, enhancing accountability, strengthening relations with       principal councils, and       extending the remit of councils, as recognized in the Explanatory       Memorandum for the National       Assembly for Wales (Legislative Competence) (Local Government) Order 2010       [which enabled the       National Assembly for Wales to introduce the legislation], and by the       National Assembly for Wales       Legislation Committee:     "[T]he study undertaken in 2003 by the University of Wales, Aberystwyth:       Institute of Geography       and Earth Sciences into community councils in Wales, "Research Study into       the Role, Functions       and Future Potential of Community and Town Councils in Wales" (the       "Aberystwyth Report")       presented a comprehensive review of the activities undertaken by community       councils across       Wales ...
In its formal response to the Aberystwyth Report (in 2004), the       Welsh Assembly       Government gave a commitment to seek legislation to address issues       identified in the review,       with a view to putting in place arrangements to develop and strengthen the       role of community       councils and enabling them to deliver a wider range of services and       actions locally.
This would       also serve to increase the effectiveness of community councils'       representational role and their       ability to work in partnership with other bodies."
[5.4]     "We welcome the provisions that relate to the promotion and improvement       of well-being as a       means of providing town and community councils with greater powers and       responsibilities.
This       reflects the findings of the Aberystwyth Report, which recommended       that community councils       should be given broader powers."
[5.5]     Of particular note is has been the creation of a new statutory power       enabling town and community       councils in Wales to co-opt two `youth representatives' (aged 16-25).
This       provision, unique in       Europe, will strengthen the voice of an under-represented section of the       community and promote       engagement in public service by young people.
It was proposed in       recommendation 8.4 in the       2003 report to the Welsh Assembly Government, and introduced by Sections       121 &#8212; 124 of the       Local Government (Wales) Measure 2011.
In addition, the research by Aberystwyth University has also directly       informed a number of other       developments that did not require legislation.
These included new guidance       on model charters       between town and community councils and principal authorities, issued by       the Welsh Government       in March 2008 [5.6], which has led to the adoption of charter agreements       in 12 of the 24 Welsh       local government areas by October 2013; and the implementation of a       National Training Strategy       for town and community councils, initially published in 2006, but       delivered over the period to 2012,       with a new strategy agreed for 2012-15 [5.7].
As the Society of Local       Council Clerks stated in their       submission to the National Assembly for Wales Legislation Committee on the       Local Government       (Wales) Measure 2011, "The training of Town and Community Council staff       has been a direct       result of many of the recommendations of the Aberystwyth Report" [5.8].
In       total, 53 of the 76       recommendations made by Aberystwyth University in the `Aberystwyth Report'       had been       implemented in full or in part by July 2013, 29 through new legislation or       action in the period since       2008.
Parallel developments in public policy relating to parish and town       councils in England have also       been informed by the research undertaken by Aberystwyth University.
In       particular, research on       the Quality Parish and Town Council Scheme [3.5] directly informed the       revision of the scheme in       2008, as noted in the foreword to the official guidance document:     "The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs commissioned       the University of       Wales to review the Scheme in 2006 and their research report helped the       National Stakeholders       to agree amendments to the Scheme that, while not placing an undue burden       on councils       wishing to achieve Quality status, would ensure that the tests remained       relevant to our tier,       would help councils to achieve ever higher levels of professionalism and       help councils to       cement their position as community leaders."
[5.9]     The modifications made to the Quality scheme as a result of the       Aberystwyth University research       included requirements for councils applying for `quality' status to       demonstrate that they work       proactively to support local democracy and citizen engagement, and to       evaluate the training needs       of members and staff.
These provisions have contributed to greater       democratic accountability and       professionalism in parish and town councils in England.
Additionally, the research has informed policy and professional practice       in the local council sector       more broadly, through invited presentations at conferences of the National       Association of Local       Councils, the Society of Local Council Clerks, and One Voice Wales;       articles in specialist media       including Local Council Review, Urban Clearway, the Municipal         Journal and the Guardian `Society'       section; and the appointment of Woods to the National Training Advisory       Group for Community       and Town Councils in Wales.
