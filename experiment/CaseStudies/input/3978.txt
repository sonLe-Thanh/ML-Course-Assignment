     Following the production of the DVD (launched, March 2009, University of       Leeds) it was uploaded onto the internet (http://lutube.leeds.ac.uk/avsmas/videos/347)       and 200 copies have been distributed, nationally and internationally.
The       online version is free to view, and usage figures show over 300 viewings       (2009-13).
Since the information and research on PGS was first presented,       both Akhurst and Green have been invited to facilitate numerous regional       workshops in England, in the Republic of Ireland and in South Africa.
Many       of these events were training and CPD events, where professionals trialled       the PGS model, leading to its adoption by groups which had been set up as       a result.
The DVD has been used to support the following events, providing       resources for local trainers continued use:            At UKZN, South Africa &#8212; Akhurst has presented workshops annually for         trainee psychologists (2007 - 2013);       Akhurst provided workshops for Hull York Medical School trainees         2007-8, which then led to a clinical psychology trainer having the         confidence to present the training thereafter (both model and 2006         article cited by S. Clement, 2008, University of Hull, training         presentation);       One of Akhurst's former students, S. Cahill, introduced the model in         Limerick and Tipperary, Ireland, and Akhurst subsequently ran workshops         in Ireland (Limerick and in Cork, 2008), leading to expanded usage of         the PGS model;       Akhurst's workshop with psychologists in North Yorkshire (2008) led to         a group being established at a York hospital.
A further workshop for         Leeds &amp; North Yorkshire clinical psychologists (2009), promoted         adoption of the model by a number of psychologists in the Yorkshire and         Northumberland services;       Akhurst's former colleague, R. Farman facilitated CPD workshops (e.g.
at a national event in Exeter, 2010) for educational psychologists, and         the PGS model was used monthly in Bedfordshire (2009-10);       From 2011, one of Akhurst's Occupational Therapy colleagues has run         workshops about the model in North and West Yorkshire for         inter-disciplinary groups.
This led to a `masterclass' workshop in 2013         for diverse practitioners to trial and use the model, with Akhurst         presenting her model in collaboration with a European specialist in PGS.
The PGS DVD has thus been used in the UK, Republic of Ireland, and South       Africa.
The model supports practitioners' work in diverse contexts, and       they report its value in supplementing individual supervision and       promoting better service delivery as follows:            In UK Psychology, examples are: Educational Psychology, Bedfordshire         County Council; Psychological Therapies Service, Dewsbury &amp; District         Hospital; Clinical Psychology, CAMHS, Sheffield; Clinical Psychology         Service for Older People, South Tyneside District Hospital.
The PGS model has also been integrated into a number of UK (and         international) postgraduate training programmes in Psychology, for         example the Clinical Psychology programme, Hull York Medical School         (HYMS); the Clinical Psychology programme, University of East London         (2009-10); PGS has been implemented and researched at the London         Metropolitan University Counselling Psychology programme (see Cross,         2011).
Internationally it has been used in the Clinical Psychology         programme, University of Limerick (2007-12); Clinical, Counselling and         Educational Psychology programmes, University of KwaZulu-Natal, South         Africa (2007-13).
In the Republic of Ireland, a number of different groups of         psychologists are regularly using the model to support reflections on         their case-work: it is being used by two groups who work in adult mental         health in the Mid-West; in Tipperary, a clinical psychologist has used         it for a multidisciplinary group working with children; in Cork, it has         been used by counsellors.
In South Africa, the model has been used for a number of successive         years (2008-12) by intern psychologists at the Student Counselling         Centre, University of KwaZulu-Natal, and by clinical psychologists at         the Midlands Hospital Complex, Pietermaritzburg.
The model has also been applied beyond the work of psychologists: in         Ireland, it has been used in Limerick, with a multidisciplinary team of         psychologists, family therapists, play and art therapists; it is also         used to support practitioners in a learning disability service, Co.         Kildare; another psychologist uses it for consultations with Social         Workers, North Tipperary; in the UK, it is being used by         interdisciplinary groups of dieticians, occupational and         physiotherapists in certain NHS sites in Yorkshire and Lancashire, and         it has been used for training in clinical supervision with diverse         healthcare professionals, Solent Healthcare NHS Trust.
In South African counselling settings: PGS has been used for a number         of years to develop volunteer counsellors' work, for example at the Open         Door Crisis Centre, Pinetown; in addition, it has also been implemented         with health care workers and counsellors in an NGO working with those         affected by HIV/Aids in Durban for debriefing and to give one another         support on an on-going basis.
