     This body of work has been pivotal in the implementation of local,       national and international active travel policies for children.
These       policies have led to increases in active travel among children.
As active       travel has been associated with improved health and is a sustainable form       of physical activity these policies will deliver both physical and mental       health benefits for beneficiaries in both the short and longer term.
Three       broad pathways demonstrate the impact of the research:     A) UK Public Health Guidance     The research led to Cooper being invited to sit on the Programme       Development Group (PDG) for development of National Institute for Health       and Clinical Excellence (NICE; now National Institute for Health and Care       Excellence) Public Health Guidance for increasing children and young       people's physical activity.
The guidance was published in January 2009       [a].
His invitation was a direct result of his leadership in research       demonstrating the potential for active travel to school to increase       children's overall physical activity.
The guidance is intended for       implementation by a wide range of deliverers from national and high level       policy and strategy through to local strategic planning, local       organisations (planning, delivery and training) and local practitioners       (delivery) (guidance pg7).
The recommendations are aimed at a wide range       of organisations and groups, including children's trusts and services,       community and voluntary groups, early years providers, Government       departments, local authorities, parents, families and carers and schools       and colleges (guidance pg 9) with the beneficiaries being pre-school and       school-age children and young people.
Cooper contributed expert opinion on       academic research into active travel to school in the development of these       guidelines.
The PDG produced 15 recommendations, of which two were       specifically about active travel (Rec5: Local Transport Plans: "Transport         plans should aim to increase the number of children and young people who         regularly walk, cycle and use other modes of physically active travel";       Rec12: Active and Sustainable School Travel Plans: that school leaders       should "encourage a culture of physically active travel (such as         walking or cycling)".
The guidance is ubiquitous in regional and       national strategic plans to improve children's health (Section 4B);       however NICE do not collect evidence of impact.
B) International and National Policy impact     The research of Cooper and Page, and resulting NICE public health       guidance, has been cited in many regional, national and international       policy documents.
For example, in County Durham the guidance is cited in       the interim cycling strategy 2009-2012 [b] which led to the FEAT 1st       (Families Enjoying Active Travel) pilot project.
This measured the effects       of encouraging more physically active travel by supporting daily journeys       to school on foot and by bike and was a collaboration between North       Tyneside Council and the transport charity Sustrans (with whom Cooper       &amp; Page work (Section 4C)).
The project resulted in an increase in       active travel to school and an almost doubling of children's physical       activity [c], and is now being rolled out across schools in Tyne and Wear.
Nationally, they are cited in the policy documents of organisations       promoting active travel (e.g.
the Cycle Touring Club ("Cycle-friendly         schools and colleges" briefing 7c (July 2012)) and Sustrans [d], and       more broadly health (British Medical Association; "Healthy         Transport=Healthy Lives" (July 2012)).
Internationally, they       are cited in policy documents from several countries including Australia,       USA, New Zealand, Denmark and Ireland.
For example, In the USA four of       their studies are cited in "Active School Travel: A Resource Binder for         Redwood City Community Members to Implement Walk and Bike to School         Programs" [e].
This document describes how to implement active       travel to school interventions and provides many examples of success, such       as in Marin County where there has been a 64% increase in the number of       students walking to school and a 114% increase in the number of children       bicycling to school (page 29).
They also provide three of twenty       references in a policy document from the US National Center for Safe       Routes to School [f] which informed the White House "Task Force on         Childhood Obesity: Report to the President" [g] where their work is       cited twice (of four references) supporting the role of active travel for       obesity prevention.
This action plan provides 70 specific recommendations       of which five relate to active travel (5.8 to 5.12) including that "Active         transport should be encouraged between homes, schools, and community         destinations.......".
These recommendations were enacted rapidly by       US Federal agencies, with the Department for Transportation initiating       National Bike to School day in 2012, which in 2013 had 1705 schools       participate across all states of the USA.
C) Working with national and international health promotion groups to         deliver direct benefits to beneficiaries     Cooper &amp; Page work directly with national and international       organisations to achieve increases in active travel among children.
In         the UK they work closely with Sustrans in supporting active travel       to school programmes such as Safe Routes to Schools and Bike It by       providing both the evidence base from their research and expert guidance       that they provide directly to the organisation.
The Sustrans programmes       are highly effective at increasing active travel.
For example, in 2011,       work with 340,000 pupils in 1,400 schools resulted in an 80% increase in       the number of children regularly cycling to school.
Philip Insall       (Sustrans Director, Health) has written "their research provides         important support for us and helps steer and ensure the success of our         work" [h].
In Denmark their work is represented on the       National Board of Health by Prof. Andersen and integrated into       recommendations ("Physical activity in prevention and treatment of         common diseases"), targeted for GPs and other health professionals.
Their research informs the work of TrygFonden, a not-for-profit Foundation       supporting action-orientated, knowledge-based projects that contribute to       increased safety, and where active transport in children is a primary       focus.
For example, in 2010 The All Kids Bikes campaign engaged 143,000       children across Denmark in cycling to school on as many days as possible,       and a recent intervention in almost 2000 children in 24 schools in Odense       increased the proportion of children cycling to school every day by 8.9%       (report in review by Danish Cycling Federation/TrygFonden).
In summary, their work provides the evidence base to support an extensive       range of interventions to increase active travel to school, is cited       widely in policy and planning documents, and is used by agencies       implementing these policies.
It should be noted that the policy documents       for these interventions are not extensive reviews of the literature &#8212;       rather they include a few examples of authoritative research which has       driven the field.
The implementation of school active travel interventions       will increase the physical activity of children with consequent health       benefits and are also likely to have environmental and economic benefit to       society, through reducing car use and lowering carbon emissions.
