     Distributing knowledge through the Northern Leadership Academy     The research has significantly changed how training providers (including       the 22 partners in the NLA) deliver business-education programmes,       underpinned by the `Principles of Good Practice'.
The NLA partners include       the business schools at all major universities in the north of England [A],       [B].
The insights gained from reviews and the EBK research were       shared widely with the business- education sector (private and public)       through a separate ESRC impact grant (&#163;32k) and a follow-on grant (&#163;76k).
All NLA partners aimed leadership or growth executive programmes at       regional SME owner-managers using the NLA principles of good practice and       constitution.
Businesses and private-sector providers could join the NLA       to utilise resources.
NLA partners have commented: "Our active         involvement with the NLA provides a very significant opportunity for         further development of our role in the SME sector" (Northumbria       University), "The think-tank has proved an excellent forum for the         sharing of best practice in providing support to the small business         community" (Manchester Metropolitan University) and "The NLA         provides us with exciting opportunity to improve our connectivity with         SME's" (Hull University) [C].
The NLA network enabled partners to embed best practice in their       educational programmes through a range of pedagogical resources, and       introduced SME owner-managers to the concept (and importance of creating)       `strategic space' - in which they focus on business planning and strategy       rather than day-to-day operations - in order to improve their business       performance.
A policy manager at Department for Business, Innovation &amp;       Skills (BIS) commented, "Two issues strike me as important: one is the         value of the network to deliver programmes that are problem centred and         learner centred locally and against principles of good practise that are         underpinned by research.
Another is the enthusiasm that partners in the         network have and the value they derive from the Northern Leadership         Academy brand" [D].
Research Council impact and       follow-on funding aided dissemination (iv) and (v).
Physical buildings were made available on four sites to bring       organisations into the universities.
The NLA supported ten educational       partners across the north (2007/8) to provide Action Learning to SME       owner-managers.
Six further centres in Yorkshire supported nearly 400       individuals with Action Learning, a Leadership Journeys programme in       Yorkshire (2009/10) supported four centres and 28 SME owner-managers       through action learning/workshops and one-to-one support, and an SME       Knowledge Network in Leeds (2009/10) engaged with 160 businesses [E].
NLA Think-Tank learning materials were freely available to these       providers' programmes and the NLA web portal enabled the sharing of       leadership resources1.
Partners gained insight into `state-       of-the-art' business pedagogy delivered by experts and shared their       experiences of successful programme delivery.
A `practitioner book' was       produced and made widely available.
A private training provider commented:       'For me, one of the profound impacts of your research was the         confirmation that the creation of `leaderful communities' was key to         successful business development..... that principle in practice         alongside strategies to create distributed leadership underpinned and         underpins my work ever since.'
[F].
Support from the NLA       also increased the involvement of regional business schools with small       businesses - example provided in [G].
Direct Business Support     Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Programme:       In 2010, LUBS launched the first Goldman Sachs (GS) programme in the UK,       which provided high-quality, practical support to the leaders of       established enterprises.
LUBS were commissioned by GS because of their NLA       experience and because the programme of research since the EBK study       (2007) was consistent with GS philosophy on learning in small businesses [H].
Each programme lasted five months (13 sessions/100 hours).
Seven cohorts       (164 businesses) had completed the programme by July 2013 - participant       case studies document the benefits to their businesses [I].
In       2011/12 the programme was rolled-out to other areas of the UK       (Manchester/Birmingham/ London), with specific support delivered by LUBS       to Manchester and Aston Universities.
The GS programme was an award winning entry in the European Foundation       for Management Development's Excellence in Practice Awards 2012 [J].
Leeds City Council's Chief Executive commented in the Yorkshire Post: `This         is a great initiative for small businesses and social enterprises to be         involved in and I'm pleased that Leeds has been chosen to host the UK         pilot'.
The programme has been evaluated to indicate that as well as       expressing greater confidence in growing their businesses, SME       owner-managers on the programme have average net employment growth of +23%       in their businesses (compared to -1% for UK Small Businesses) and an       average revenue growth of +16% (compared to -9% for UK Small Businesses) [K].
Speaking at Making the Case for the Social Sciences, June 2012, Vince       Cable MP, said: `The people who can really make use of this       [research] are SMEs, so actually defining SME business training is         important.
I think the work which Goldman Sachs have taken on can         potentially be very valuable.
Some really interesting stuff here and I         wanted to thank you for that and register my own interest.'

Through NLA Training Providers:     This research has been distilled into different training and educational     programmes which have directly benefitted businesses.
Participating SME     owner-managers have used `strategic space' to explore new markets, expand     and create jobs [F] [G].
Liverpool programme participants said: `I       was amazed to look back at the paths we had each travelled during the time       of the programme and observe the progress we had all achieved' and `I       found the whole experience not only challenging but helped in increasing       my interpersonal skills at an executive level' [M].
Regional and national policy on SME support     The research has been used by policymakers focusing on regional       development and business growth, enabling them to identify new       opportunities to stimulate SME growth and benefit the economy during the       period 2008 to 2010.
It was important in developing regional policy and       strategic objectives [B].
Since 2010 re-organisation of the       support infrastructure, partners have made new links with BIS to ensure       the contribution to local economies improves.
Having met with David       Willetts MP, Minister for Universities and Science, Thorpe was       invited to join the BIS Mid- Sized Businesses Programme on the Harnessing       Leadership Capability Task Force.
He was chair of Theme 2 (promoting good       practice among business-skills providers nationally) and a member of Theme       5 (ensuring that the benefits of other themes are delivered to SMEs) [C].
Work from the NLA contributed to the Association of Business School's       (ABS's) report2 (`The Role of UK Business Schools in Driving       Innovation and Growth in the Domestic Economy') authored by Thorpe       and Rawlinson of Booz &amp; Co [N].
Thorpe met with Sir       Andrew Witty's team (July 2013) who were taking evidence from the ABS       report for the Independent Review of Universities and Growth, in relation       to Business Schools and SME development.
Preparation of the ABS report led       to discussions with Lord Young in relation to his Enterprise initiative       and this led directly to business schools becoming involved in developing       the Enterprise Charter.
