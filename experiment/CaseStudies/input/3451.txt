     The research detailed above has had a number of impacts, primarily on       health and welfare, and on commerce.
Impacts on commerce: industry has invested in research and         development, the performance of an existing business has been improved,         jobs have been protected     CBT raised &#163;6.3 million in 2001/2 and a further &#163;4 million in 2005.
It       was acquired by Biovitrium for &#163;27 million later in 2005, and at this       point moved from the Department to a purpose-built research facility south       of Cambridge (at Babraham).
By 2008, CBT, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of       Biovitrium, employed 30 research staff and two administrative staff, and       was primarily focused on the discovery and development of novel small       molecule therapeutics in the areas of pain, inflammation and obesity.
The       company also continued to work on small molecule leptin mimetics,       following out-licensing of the technology from the Richardson group in       2001.
In 2009, Biovitrium's (pre-clinical) leptin mimetic project was sold       in its entirety to AstraZeneca for &#8364;186 million7.
In October 2009, CBT was sold by Biovitrium to Proximagen plc8       (value undisclosed), a company focusing on the development and       commercialization of novel therapeutics for diseases of the central       nervous system (CNS).
As part of the deal, Proximagen acquired certain CBT       programmes (see below under `Impacts on health and welfare'); CBT       continued to exist as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Proximagen, serving as       its drug discovery and development arm, and with CBT employees serving as       the scientific core of Proximagen.
In addition to progressing the various       research programmes, CBT assisted Proximagen in fund raising (&#163;50M in 2009       and &#163;10M in 2011), and in preparing the company for its subsequent       acquisition by Upsher-Smith.
In 2012 Upsher-Smith, a US-based pharmaceutical company, acquired       Proximagen (including CBT) for &#163;223 million in the first instance (and       potentially up to &#163;356.8 million, depending on milestones)9.
Although Upsher-Smith's existing strengths were in women's health,       dermatology and cardiology, it was expanding its CNS drug discovery work,       where it already had one treatment in Phase III trials.
Of the 15 drug       candidates taken on from Proximagen, nine originated from CBT, including       the most advanced of these, PRX00933 (see below under `Impacts on health       and welfare').
This was Upsher-Smith's first and only acquisition outside       of the US.
The President and Chief Executive Officer of Upsher-Smith has       stated that "The acquisition of Proximagen adds significantly to our         scientific capabilities and supports the acceleration of our vision of         becoming a leader in the CNS category.....the combination of         Upsher-Smith's clinical development and commercialization expertise with         Proximagen's research and development platform provides the opportunity         to further enhance our ability to bring new therapies to market to         benefit patients"10     CBT continues to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Upsher-Smith,       and remains drug discovery-and early development-focused (i.e.
up to       Phase II).
CBT currently employs 34 scientists and 3 support staff at       Babraham.
Impacts on health and welfare: a new clinical intervention has been         developed, trialled and definitive outcome demonstrated     Research undertaken by Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Company (now Kyowa Hakko Kirin)       with advisory input from Richardson found that in rodent and primate       models, KW-6002 provided symptomatic relief from Parkinsonian motor       deficits without provoking dyskinesia.
Experiments with dopamine D2Sh       and D2Lh receptor knockout mice showed that the anti-PD       activities of A2A antagonists are independent of the       dopaminergic system11.
Clinical studies of KW-6002 in patients       with advanced PD with L-DOPA-related motor complications (conducted by the       KW-6002 	  US-001 Study Group) also yielded promising results with regard to       motor symptom relief without motor side effects11.
Clinical       trials carried out by Kyowa Hakko Kogyo in Japan (Phase 3 2009-2012,       NCT00957203) demonstrated sufficient beneficial effects for the product to       receive marketing authorisation as an antiparkinsonian agent (as Nouriast)       in Japan in March 201312.
A repeat Phase III clinical trial in       the US is being arranged (NCT not yet known) in order to obtain approval       for marketing from the FDA (the original Phase III trial in the US failed       because of issues with patient selection, NCT00199407).
When Proximagen acquired CBT in 2009, CBT's drug development programmes       included a Phase IIB-ready anti-obesity drug (PRX00933, a 5HT2c agonist)13,       a Phase I-ready anti-inflammatory programme for rheumatoid arthritis and       psoriasis (PRX167700), two programmes ready for toxicity testing (one now       in preclinical development), and two discovery programmes.
Proximagen took       PRX00933 through Phase IIB trials for obesity, where it showed a       dose-dependent and statistically significant decrease in body weight       within FDA guidelines for this condition14.
PRX167700 completed       Phase I trials for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis in late 201215;       outcomes were successful, namely the drug was well tolerated and biomarker       measurements confirmed biological activity.
A phase II is currently being       planned.
PRX167700 is also currently undergoing Phase II trials in the UK       for knee osteoarthritis (NCT01945346)16.
