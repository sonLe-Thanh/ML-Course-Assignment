     Context: Research conducted by UpERU has played an important role       in guiding peatland restoration practice in the southern Pennines, and has       made a significant contribution to the development of practice and the       formulation of policy across the UK's peatlands.
As this diagram (above) highlights, the structuring of pathways to         impact has led to significant influence on practice, and policy,       relating to upland peatland management.
A key pathway has been through the       group's engagement with the Moors for the Future Partnership (MFFP) - a       partnership between: the Environment Agency, National Trust, Natural       England, Peak District National Park Authority, RSPB, Severn Trent Water,       United Utilities, and Yorkshire Water.
MFFP was set up to communicate the       importance of peatland restoration work to restore peatlands and has a       significant national role within upland conservation policy.
UpERU has       developed formal links with MFFP with Allott serving on the Advisory Group       to the partnership, as well as a range of informal and ongoing       collaborations, applying research evidence to guide landscape scale       restoration projects.
As a result, a number of impacts have emerged       from both the foundational research, as well as via engagement with MFFP       and its partners:     (1) UpERU research forms the rationale and scientific underpinning for         the extensive investment in landscape-scale peatland restoration         currently underway in the Peak District National Park.
MFFP, United       Utilities and the National Trust have used the research to justify both       the investment in restoration, and the required restoration measures.
Investment by MFFP to date totals &gt;&#163;13 million [1], and in line with       UpERU recommendations has been earmarked to restore the ecosystem       functions of these iconic but degraded systems, using re-vegetation and       gully blocking techniques (the `Peak District Model').
It is notable that       impacts have emerged directly from findings garnered from peer reviewed       research, from advice based on these findings and through ideas reported       directly to MFFP through commissioned research reports informed by the       original work [B][E].
As MFFP's programme manager has noted, UoM       research "provides a reliable and robust evidence base on which we         have been able to develop a multimillion pound programme of works       [with]... supporting evidence... from University of Manchester         publications... instrumental in MFFP and National Trust securing 2.2M         for blanket bog restoration work, {from the EA catchment restoration         fund} by far the largest funding award within the programme" [1].
Similarly, Natural England's Upland specialist has stated that: "Without         your work as a key part of the overall body of evidence we would be in a         much weaker position to justify the use of public money for this type of         restoration" [2].
UpERU research has also assisted United Utilities       as they seek to quantify the benefits of their moorland restoration work,       with [E] recognised as a "key document... used to direct several         hundred thousand pounds of work" [3].
(2) UpERU engagement with MFFP has led to significant secondary         impacts, through the role of MFFP as a major contributor to national         policy debate in this area, and also through the recognition of the MFFP         model as a national exemplar.
This has led to MFFP being cited as a       template for the formation of similar regional peat restoration bodies in       the North Pennines, the North York Moors National Park and in Dartmoor and       Exmoor National Parks.
As noted by the Exmoor Mires project manager:     "The early work carried out by the Moors for the future project in         association with the Northern Universities and in particular the         University of Manchester is the platform which underpins the research we         are now carrying out in the South West.
Not only was the [MFFP] projects'         research work fundamental, but their programme work in the Peak District         paved the way to secure the MotM [Mires on the Moors] project and         buy in and investment from SWW and other partners."
[4]     The influence of the `Peak District model' of restoration thus extends       across the moorlands of Britain; MFFP's programme manager agreeing that "University         of Manchester evidence has been one of the pillars that has supported         MFFP's success.
Success that has been transferred nationally through the         adoption of our restoration model and methods in other upland peatland         areas" [1].
(3) UpERU research has led to the development and adoption, by         restoration practitioners, of new approaches for post-treatment         monitoring of peatland restoration, the associated recovery of key       carbon and water functions and the implementation of these in restoration       programmes, both in the Peak District and more widely such as in MotM,       where: "The investment in the research and monitoring element of the         Exmoor Mires project alone is approximately half of the total project         budget at just over &#163;1.3 million" [4].
MFFP recognises that UpERU's       work "provides a scientific basis which we now use to monitor the         impact of all our restoration works" [1].
UpERU with MFFP have now       also been able to effectively build monitoring capacity, based on the       original research, via citizen science approaches such as the       training of Peak Park Rangers and volunteers for restoration monitoring       programmes.
(4) UpERU research has had wider impacts on land management policy in         the uplands.
Three areas stand out.
Firstly, work on the role of       particulate carbon in peatland carbon budgets, which has influenced       Department for Environment Food &amp; Rural Affairs (DEFRA) thinking on       fluvial carbon "as part of the body of evidence to the development of         Defra's thinking on the need to better understand the full carbon and         greenhouse gas budgets of peatlands..." and led to the &#163;300K DEFRA       project `Greenhouse gas emissions associated with non-gaseous losses of       carbon - fate of particulate and dissolved carbon' [5].
Secondly, work on peatland hydrology and carbon balance, which has formed       part of the consultation for the National Trust `High Peak Moors Vision       and Plan: 2013-2038', that for the first time includes a specific policy       to manage the landscape for carbon and water.
The consultation response       document noted that the plan would put "into practice management that         should, in time, improve carbon storage and water quality.
At a wider         level we have been working hard with DEFRA on the best ways to direct         more public (and indeed private sector) resources towards schemes which         support better soil, carbon, water and landscape-scale management."
This is confirmed by the Trust's General Manager (Peak District):     The Trust manages in excess of 14,000 hectares of land - approximately         13% of the whole Peak District National Park... One of the major         activities for us over the last ten or so years in pursuit of the above         has been restoration of the blanket peat soils of our moorland...       [Allott and Evans'] 2009 report provided clear evidence of the positive         impacts of peat restoration for water tables and peatland health.
Importantly, the report also developed monitoring techniques which are         being employed by the Moors for the Future partnership to evaluate the         success of the (&#163;2.5million) Kinder Catchment Peat Restoration project         (2010-2015).
The Trust also invited Allott to provide expert         hydrological advice for the development of the High Peak Moors Vision         and Plan... University of Manchester research and advice was invaluable         in embedding the new emphasis on carbon, water and climate change within         the plan and the proposed management of the Estate into the future."
[6]     Thirdly, work on peatland erosion which has influenced Natural England       responses to planning applications.
In the words of Natural England's       Upland Specialist, UpERU research: "helped demonstrate that upland         peat can be far more dynamic in terms of accretion and losses than was         previously thought... currently heavily eroded areas are not lost and         that natural recovery can take place...
In recent years, large sums of         public money have been invested in the restoration of blanket bog.
Central to this has been a growing understanding of the hydrology of         these sites" [2].
(5) As a result of their research, Evans and Allott were invited         participants in the International Union for Conservation of Nature         (IUCN) expert inquiry panel on Peatlands.
In response to the       subsequent IUCN report, the environment ministers of all four home nations       have written a joint letter outlining policy responses aimed at       `protecting and enhancing the natural capital provided by peatlands in the       UK...' [7].
The director of the IUCN UK Peatland Programme recognised the       importance of UpERU "research work on particulate carbon from         peatlands", noting that it "provided valuable background for UK         scientists who are developing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate         Change (IPCC) guidance on peatland rewetting and has been used in         providing the metrics for a peatland carbon code which could help secure         private funding for peatland restoration.
In conclusion, Professor         Evans' work and that of colleagues at the University of Manchester has         provided important evidence in securing action across a wide range of         policy, science and practice activities aimed at restoring and         conserving peatlands" [8].
