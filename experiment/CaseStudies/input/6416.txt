     Beneficiaries and dates of benefit: The six million UK children       with Child Trust Fund accounts are its main beneficiaries.
Between 2020       and 2029 they will gain access to funds that had already amounted to &#163;4.8       bn by May 20132.
Arguably, parents also benefit as they can         currently (from April 6, 2013) put up to &#163;3,720 of tax-free savings into         these accounts on their children's behalf.
Under the original scheme all         children born on or after September 1, 2002 received a voucher which         their parents could use to start a savings account that their child         could not touch until the age of 18.
All families initially received a         &#163;250 voucher, while children from low-income households qualified for an         extra &#163;250.
The Labour government later decided to pay another &#163;250 into         fund accounts at age 7 (this applied between September 1, 2009 and July         31, 2010).
Those in low-income families got a further &#163;250 at age 7.
The         scheme was closed to children who were born after January 2, 2011.
Reach and significance: Bynner and Despotidou's findings helped to       persuade Labour ministers to proceed with the trust fund scheme.
This       initiative was included in Labour's 2001 election manifesto and was       eventually launched in January 2005.
The IOE research influenced the       politicians and policy advisers who initiated the scheme.
It has also       helped to shape policy thinking on asset-based welfare in other countries.
As the following evidence demonstrates, the study has had two important       types of impact which can be categorised3 as `instrumental'         (influencing policy and/or practice) and `conceptual' (enhancing general         understanding and informing debate).
Instrumental impact:       Bynner discussed his findings with government policy advisers at a No.
10       Strategy Unit meeting in early 2000.
Gavin Kelly, of the IPPR, the       policy's principal architect, attended this meeting, as did key advisers       from the Prime Minister's Office.
Bynner also gave a presentation on his       research to the Savings and Assets for All seminar held at 11 Downing       Street on July 18, 2001.
Influence on Gavin Kelly: Ten years later Kelly reflected       on the importance of the IOE research in persuading the government to       launch `baby bonds' in a BBC Radio 4 interview with Guardian       journalist Polly Toynbee in September 2011 mdash; see impact source S1.
"It was a rather idealistic notion in some ways, that Britain would be         a very different and better country if every young person grew up         knowing that when they come of age that they would have something behind         them to let them get a decent start in life.
We also did it though         because we had hard, hard evidence that this intuition actually was         real.
We did a big study with the Institute of Education looking at what         happened to those young adults who started off in life with a small         capital sum, a pot of assets if you like, at their disposal compared to         those who didn't ...
It was a very powerful effect and one which was         much more powerful than frankly we had expected to find and so we were         driven on by that finding &#8212; and by what we saw happening more generally         in terms of asset inequality".
Impact on ministers' thinking: Six years earlier, in       another Radio 4 interview (S2), David Blunkett, the former       Education Secretary, had also confirmed that the research had a       significant impact on government thinking.
"We were absolutely         staggered by the difference that having some assets, some stake, made to         individuals, not just in terms of that start in life as adults at the         age of 18 but throughout life, a difference obviously in terms of         security and stability, but also actually their willingness to engage         with life.
That stake transforms not only their interest in themselves,         in employment, in education but aspiration for their children, a         willingness to participate in wider community events, all those things         materially affected by whether someone has a stake, and it doesn't have         to be a massive stake".
David Blunkett also testified to the       importance of the IOE research in helping to shape the scheme in a 2003       lecture (S3) in which he expanded on his thinking about asset-based       welfare.
Green Paper: The impact of the research on government       thinking had, however, been acknowledged as early as 2001 &#8212; in Savings         and assets for all (S4), a Green Paper which sought agreement       on the broad principles behind the scheme.
This document referred to the       IOE study and said: "... this powerful new evidence suggests that having       access to at least limited financial assets can have a marked impact on       people's economic and social wellbeing".
Conceptual impact:       Social mobility report: John Bynner's findings have also       been cited in high-profile policy documents such as Unleashing         aspiration, the 2009 report of the panel on fair access to the       professions chaired by Alan Milburn MP, who subsequently became the       coalition Government's `social mobility tsar'.
His report notes: "There         is good evidence, for example, that access to moderate amounts of         financial capital at an early age can have major impacts on later life         outcomes: a small amount of capital (between &#163;300 and &#163;600) at age 23 is         associated with better outcomes later in life" (S5).
Overseas influence: Policy-makers and think tanks from       countries including the USA, France, Germany, New Zealand and Brazil have       shown interest in learning from the UK's baby bonds `experience'.
Some of       the documents that have emerged from their deliberations refer to the       findings of the IOE study (S6).
The New America Foundation       referred to the IOE research in its testimony to a US Senate sub-committee       that investigated ways of building assets for low income families in 2005.
The Foundation reported that: "... work in the United Kingdom ...         found a `persistent effect of assets on a number of outcomes, which were         impervious to a wide range of controls', and `the assets-effect was         sustained, with employment, psychological health, belief in the         political system and values, all appearing to be enhanced by assets'."
(S7).
The same statement appeared in the first major Canadian book       on asset-based policy (S8).
The IOE research is also referred to       in reports on assets-based policies prepared for international bodies such       as the World Bank (S9), the European Commission (S10) and       the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
