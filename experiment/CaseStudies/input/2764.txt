     a) The most significant means by which Turner's research enhanced         public understanding was through the creation and response to a       ten-part series `Disability: A New History' for BBC Radio 4, a       collaboration between Turner, production company Loftus Media and the       BBC's Disability Affairs Correspondent who presented it (C1).
Turner collaborated with the producer to develop the idea for a series       intended to get disability out of a broadcasting ghetto and into the       popular mainstream by showing the richness of its pre-twentieth century       history.
Whereas the BBC TV series The Disabled Century (1999) had       looked at changing attitudes to disability in Britain since 1914, no       series on radio or TV had ever examined disability before this period in a       sustained way.
Turner was actively involved in the lengthy commissioning       process, helping to write the prospectus for the series and accompanying       the producer to a meeting with the Commissioning Editor, General Factual       Programmes at BBC Radio 4, and was subsequently appointed academic adviser       on the project.
The series was collaborative, involving interviews with       Turner and 13 other historians who contributed additional insights from       their own research.
However, during the development and recording of the       series (September 2012-April 2013) Turner made a unique contribution in       designing the content of each episode with the producer, using his       research to provide sources for readings in 8 of the 10 programmes,       providing expert interviews used in 4 programmes, using his knowledge and       standing in the field to find other contributors, and guiding the       historical interpretation and accuracy of the script, with the production       team using his book as their primary historical reference.
Turner's research thus had a significant impact in creating a new         cultural product, influencing the production in terms of content and       interpretation.
Turner's research was instrumental in providing a variety       of new sources read by actors that would surprise and challenge the       audience, including advertisements for medical products, jokes,       testimonies of freak show performers, and in leading the team to sources       where disabled people spoke for themselves.
The producer writes that       Turner's research `was invaluable in shaping the series, and both the       presenter and I drew on his book both as background and to provide       materials, e.g., readings for the series', and that `this Radio 4           series would never have happened if I had not met and interviewed           David Turner' whose `authority and standing as a historian         &#8212; particularly his recent book Disability in Eighteenth-Century England         were crucial to having the series commissioned by Radio 4'.
She writes that Turner's contribution has `made me think in a new           way about how we define disability, not just in the past but now'.
The BBC Disability Affairs Correspondent commented that the series had       given him `a number of new perspectives ... not least the doubt much of         the research sheds on the idea that we are making perpetual progress in         our attitudes to disability' (C2).
The series was broadcast weekdays at 1.45 pm between 27th May       and 7th June 2013 in a popular slot which gave its impact on       enriching public discourses of disability a wide reach.
(C3) The       series attracted much discussion in the press and social media.
On Twitter       several disability campaigners and organisations such as Remploy debated       questions raised by the series, such as whether disabled performers in the       eighteenth century were exploited or entrepreneurs &#8212; a theme addressed by       Turner in an interview contribution to episode 3 and in an article for the       BBC Ouch!
Disability blog (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-ouch-22637045).
Some in the disability community tweeted about how the series had empowered       them by allowing them to imagine their lives through the ages.
The Daily         Telegraph (29 May 2013) marvelled at the `surprising amount           of documentary evidence' revealed by the series, while the Observer       (2 June 2013) noted how the series created a new kind of history       because `the disabled have never really featured in our stories of         ourselves' (4).
The series identified Turner as the expert to       contact to find out more about disability history.
He received letters       from members of the public including from a woman who had heard his       account of the limbless artist Matthew Buchinger in episode 3 who sought       his advice on donating a previously unknown engraving by the artist in her       possession to a public repository, and from a successful popular novelist       asking for advice on writing about disability in her forthcoming novel.
b) Turner's work has also contributed to public discourse about         disability and welfare reform via an article, `"Fraudulent"       Disability in Historical Perspective' published by History and Policy       on 14th February 2012 to coincide with the debate of the       Welfare Reform Bill in the House of Lords (http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-130.html).
Whilst public debate on welfare had drawn on historical precedents before,       there had been little discussion of the period before the nineteenth       century in general &#8212; or which addressed disability in particular &#8212; prior       to Turner's intervention.
The piece had immediate impact, leading to an article published on the       BBC News Wales website which forced a Department of Work and Pensions       spokesman to defend the integrity of government policy (C5).
The impact of       Turner's work is evident in terms of its reach, with the BBC News       article shared 78 times on Twitter by political organisations, disability       activists and anti-cuts campaigners.
Feedback from the public included `interesting         and thought-provoking article about our attitudes towards disability'       and several respondents indicated how the research had enriched the         vocabulary of political debate highlighting how the early modern       term `clapperdogeon' showed that the stigmatising of welfare claimants was       not new (C6).
Turner's research findings were also reported in the Western         Mail on 20 February 2012 with a response from the policy officer of       Disability Rights UK on how government policy was increasing public       hostility to disabled people (C7).
Turner did a 30 minute live interview       on BBC Radio Wales Jamie and Louise Show (28 February 2012) and was       interviewed by BBC Kent (21 February 2012) in a feature on a family about       to lose state benefits for their disabled son.
The impetus given to         disability rights campaigns is evident in Turner's article being       recommended by various voluntary sector organisations, including links on       the Facebook pages of Disability Wales, ACT NOW, Autism Campaigners       together, and the Benefits Helpline website.
Turner published a follow-up       opinion piece for History and Policy (http://www.historyandpolicy.org/opinion/opinion_96.html)       to coincide with the London 2012 Paralympics, which was described by the       CEO of Scope, as a `very interesting piece' (C8).
For disabled people the research was significant in showing that they         have allies who were able to articulate their concerns using historical         evidence.
One person facing reassessment of their benefits wrote of       Turner that `we need the help of people like yourself and your         colleagues' to highlight the struggles affecting disabled people       (C9).
