     Evans' work on gender in China has been disseminated through diverse       outlets including frequent BBC radio programmes and TV interviews, blog       postings, women's organizations in China, workshops and meetings with       NGOs, activists and corporate personnel (Deloitte's and Flamingo London),       and consultancy with charitable organizations and legal practices.
Since       2008, it has spawned numerous collaborative projects and activities, with       the Shanghai International Female Forum and the All China Women's       Federation (2008-2009), the Ford Foundation (2010-2012), Shaanxi Research       Association for Women and Family (2010), WAGnet (2011), Marie Stopes       International (2011), diverse UK-based NGOs working on and in China       (including Xin Ran's `Mothers' Bridge of Love', 2011), Chinese       educationists and health professionals working on gender and sexuality       education (2008-2011), UK- based legal practices (2008-2011), and with the       Institute of Sexuality, Renmin University, Beijing.
In Chinese       translation, Evans' work has reached diverse audiences in China, evidenced       by a dialogue with Lin Yinhe, one of China's leading feminist activists,       filmed at CASS and distributed on Youtube, and in reports and reviews of       her work in popular outlets in Hong Kong and China.
Through translation       and numerous meetings and conferences, Evans' work has influenced the       ideas and work of significant members of the provincial and Beijing       branches of the All China Women's Federation, and activists working on       women's and gender rights.
Her work with international and Chinese NGOs       working on gender issues in law, family, health (including HIV/AIDS) and       reproduction led to an invitation to become a Trustee of the UK-based       charity and NGO The Rights Practice (TRP), specifically to bring her       expertise on gender issues in China to bear in its work with Chinese       lawyers and legal associations to promote the rights of Chinese citizens       in judiciary and political procedures.
The Executive Director of TRP has       noted that "Evans' commitment to thinking about how legal and human rights       practice in China needs to give greater recognition to gender difference       has been crucial in our decisions about the allocation of funds to promote       our work with legal institutions.
TRP's support of diverse initiatives in       China on women's legal and political rights [is] in significant measure a       result of Professor Evans' work with us."
Despite his status as early career researcher, Hird's work has already       had a significant impact in non- academic circles, through his       contribution to founding the Queer Chinese Working Group (2011), his work       with the Ford Foundation (Beijing) in sponsoring activist work on sexual       rights in China (2011- 2012), and with Ogilvy and Mather (Shanghai) where       he spent a week conducting gender-training workshops (2011).
Hird and       Evans held a highly successful gender training workshop as the first of a       series of workshops with UK based NGOs working on and in China (2011).
The       impact of these activities has been to change attitudes about the       significance of gender in social and political campaign work; open up       debate in China about gender identities in same-sex and heterosexual       contexts, and explore new avenues for advertising campaigns, specifically       with Ogilvy and Mather's Volkswagen Team.
Following Hird's visit to Ogilvy       and Mather, the Account Director of Ogilvy One Worldwide, Beijing, a       participant of Hird's workshop, wrote that "During the past few weeks the       team has worked on a creative direction and idea that was initiated and       stimulated by the workshop....The topic, the agenda, the breadth and depth       chosen for the workshop has been ideal for us and we would be looking       forward to any similar initiative if planned in the future."
