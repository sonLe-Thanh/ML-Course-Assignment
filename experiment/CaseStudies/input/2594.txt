     Over the last decade, the nature and legacy of Republican and Francoist       killings during and after the civil war has provoked intense and often       bitter discussion within Spain.
Ruiz has made a significant contribution       to what has been an extremely politicised and polarised debate by offering       a more critical and objective perspective informed by empirical archival       research.
In so doing, he has challenged orthodoxies and myths, enabling a       more informed public understanding of the civil war and its longer-term       effects.
In January 2009, Ruiz published an article in the current affairs       magazine El Noticiero de las Ideas critiquing magistrate Baltasar       Garz&#243;n's October 2008 order to prosecute posthumously leading members of       the Franco regime (including the dead dictator himself) for genocide.
Ruiz       showcased his arguments in an extended review essay published in the Revista         de Libros (the Spanish equivalent of the TLS or LRB)       in April 2011 (see 5.1).
According to &#193;lvaro Delgado-Gal, the editor, it       `had a great impact on opinion in Madrid', because it did not `accept the       conventional and entrenched positions of the debate' (correspondence with       Ruiz, 14/4/2011).
Delgado-Gal then commissioned Ruiz to write a 5,000 word       review of Paul Preston's controversial book El Holocausto Espa&#241;ol       [The Spanish Holocaust].
This essay, which contrasted claims of       `uncontrollable' Republican terror with evidence taken from Ruiz's       research, was published as the lead review in the December 2011 issue       (5.2).
Three months later, Delgado-Gal commented that the article had been       `enormously talked about in Spain' and commissioned Ruiz again to write an       extended review of Michael Seidman's The Victorious Counterrevolution,       a re-examination of the Francoist war effort (correspondence with Ruiz,       19/3/2012).
This appeared in the November 2012 edition.
It was on the basis of this growing reputation as a prominent historian       in the public sphere that Espasa Calpe, one of the Spain's largest       commercial publishers, offered Ruiz a book contract in 2009.
Before       publication on 17 January 2012, Espasa informed the author that El         Mundo, Spain's second-largest national daily, wanted to serialise       the book.
The three-page feature (as well as a 3 minute audio commentary       by Ruiz on its website) appeared on Sunday 15 January 2012 (5.3), and the       editor Pedro J.Ram&#237;rez, tweeted his over 78,000 followers that he wished       to read the book.
The article was followed two days later by a `question       and answer' interview on the main theses of the book that appeared on the       newspaper's website (5.4), which in turn prompted 33 Facebook `recommends'       and 17 tweets.
The publication of the book was accompanied by interviews       and features in other national dailies such as ABC (96 Facebook       `like', 36 tweets and 26 comments), La Raz&#243;n (60 Facebook `like'       and 14 tweets) and La Gaceta (5.5 - 5.7).
Ruiz was interviewed on       radio for the national state network (Radio Nacional) and Carlos       Herrera's popular morning show on Onda Cero (5.8) among others.
The Spanish state press agency, EFE, also issued a press release on the       book, which meant that Ruiz's findings were disseminated in the provincial       press (see e.g.
El Correo of Bilbao (5.9) and El Norte de         Castilla of Valladolid).
This Spanish media coverage, extremely       unusual for an academic monograph, caused book sales to rocket.
2,000       copies of El terror rojo were sold in the first month of       publication, prompting a reprint in February 2012.
A total of 2,900 print       books were sold in the first 6 months of publication as well as 70-e-books       (email correspondence with Ruiz from publisher 25/6/2012).
Espasa       currently has a catalogue of 1,341 titles, and Ruiz's book was one of 24       listed as a `bestseller' on its website (spring &#8212; summer 2012).
In June       2012, he participated in a television documentary on the terror that was       broadcast on the regional channel Telemadrid, and which was       triggered by the publication of the book.
Reviewing the book later in the       year, historian Juan Avil&#233;s wrote in El Mundo (9/11/2012) that       'the appearance of Julius Ruiz's well-conceived and documented study is to       be celebrated...because El Terror Rojo demolishes the comforting       thesis that, unlike the rightist repression which was planned and       organised from above, the leftist repression was the work of       "uncontrollables".'
In terms of its significance, Ruiz's research project has been publicly       acclaimed for its objectivity and lack of partisanship.
Writing in the       culture section of the centre-right ABC on 12 February 2012,       `M.A.V.'
praised his `exhaustive investigation'; two months later, on 11       April, Jorge Reverte, columnist in the centre-left El Pa&#237;s, paid       tribute to his `magnificent and well-documented study', albeit one that       was `uncomfortable' reading for some.
Ruiz has also received several dozen       e-mails from satisfied readers from across the socio-political spectrum.
These include messages from relatives of those who perished in the terror       in Madrid, but also an e-mail from a nephew of one of the perpetrators,       who sent family documents relating to the post-war fate of his ancestor.
In April 2013 El terror rojo was re-issued as a cheap paperback       by Espasa.
A month later, it was awarded Spain's 2012 Hislibris Prize for       best history book (5.10).
Hislibris is the country's largest community of       history bloggers and its website attracts 200,000 visitors a month.
The       award is evidence of the reach of the research amongst the Spanish public       and of the wide recognition accorded to it in shifting the terms of public       debate.
In June 2013, Dr Ruiz accepted an offer from Espasa to write an       80000-word monograph on the Paracuellos de Jarama massacres in Madrid.
The       book is due for publication in 2014.
