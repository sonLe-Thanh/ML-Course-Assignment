     The impact of the University's work on developing new structural concepts       and structural methods has been the use of the results and the tools by       industry on a variety of aerospace applications.
Here, we present six       examples.
1) A new structural concept that is now in-flight       Lemanski and Weaver's unique anisotropic composite design [4] was used in       the development of the BERP IV helicopter rotor blade in 2005-06 for       AgustaWestland's EH101 helicopter.
The Principal Rotor Engineer from       AgustaWestland reported that "the design, which uses unbalanced         anisotropic angle plies at a specific fibre orientation, gives         performance enhancement by coupling bending and torsion within the blade         to reduce the loads experienced by the rotor control system.
Eighty five         of these blades, each with typical value of &#163;100k, have been purchased         by the UK MoD as part of an Urgent Operational Requirement in order to         enhance the range and capability of the EH101 aircraft in Theatre"       [a].
Note that of the 85 blades, worth approximately &#163;8.5M, 70 were       ordered since 2008.
They all continue to be flown and are used in       situations where a heavy lift capability is required.
2) A new analysis tool that influenced Airbus's A380 wing design       Miller and Weaver's thermoelastic analysis [1] has been developed into a       new structural analysis tool for Airbus.
When designing the A3XX (which       subsequently became the A380) aircraft, Airbus considered both aluminium       and hybrid CFRP/aluminium wing designs.
The Bristol-based tool was used by       Airbus to inform the decision to use a largely aluminium, rather than       hybrid, wing design [b].
As of July 2013 there have been firm orders for       262 A380s [c] with a market value of over $105B, based on an average list       cost of $404M each [d].
3) A new beam section analysis tool for AgustaWestland and then         LUSAS's software       Hill and Weaver's beam section analysis [2], for calculating 6x6 stiffness       matrices for helicopter rotor blade sections, and the subsequent       optimisation method [3] have been incorporated into AgustaWestland       Helicopter's internal design codes (BSAP) [a].
The inclusion of these       tools allows AgustaWestland to predict the response of rotor blades more       accurately such that flight performance is improved via a reduction in       deleterious vibration response whilst maintaining structural integrity.
In       addition to this improvement, Bristol's optimisation technique reduced the       work of an engineer that previously took two weeks, to a matter of minutes       [a].
Bristol's beam section analysis, which provides the 6x6 stiffness       properties for finite element beams, was an improvement on the then       current state-of-the-art techniques used in commercial finite element       packages.
It was incorporated into LUSAS's finite element software in 2008       [e], giving LUSAS the commercial advantage of being able to model the       structural response of complicated multi-material beam sections.
4) New buckling analysis tool for Cassidian       Weaver's closed-form buckling solutions for plates and shells [5-6] are       now a key part of Cassidian's LAGRANGE multidisciplinary optimisation       software.
The work was transferred to Cassidian via a &#163;10k consultancy in       2006, and allows rapid analysis of the buckling capability of thin-walled       sections such as wings and fuselages.
As an example application, it has       been used to help design the Airbus A350XWB aircraft structure [f].
The       Airbus A350XWB is the first commercial Airbus aircraft to be mostly       designed with composite materials.
It had its maiden flight in July 2013       and first delivery is expected in mid 2014.
So far 682 firm orders have       been received [g] with a value of circa $173B, based on an A350-800       average list price of $254M [d].
Cassidian also intends to use these       structural analysis models in the design of a European Unmanned Air       Vehicle in 2014 [f].

New structural failure analysis led to new structural concept for         Airbus       New analytical expressions for predicting the structural failure of       stiffened wing panel structures [6] have been adopted in Airbus' design       codes.
Specifically the Senior Lead Stress for the A350-1000 Midbox states       that "the in depth understanding and methods developed during my PhD       [at Bristol] helped Airbus refine their stringer runout design.
The         knowledge has been transferred transnationally throughout Airbus and         Bristol's expertise is acknowledged.
Furthermore, the papers published         have been used as a starting point to define methods and allowables,         helping Airbus prepare comprehensive Aircraft Certification Documents         minimising the need for large tests" [b].
These methods have supported the design of wings in commercial aircraft       variants of the A350XWB: A350-900 and A350-1000 as well as the military       aircraft A400M.
As of August 2013, when it had its maiden flight, 174       A400M aircraft have been ordered [h].
Current savings of over &#163;700k from       virtual testing are estimated based on a typical cost of &#163;35k per test.
In       addition to this cost saving, the new design based on Bristol's methods       reduces the weight of a wing by approximately 10kg per wing [b] giving       operational savings of around &#163;14M based on the orders for A350XWB and       A400M using a &#163;800/kg cost to weight value.
This analysis subsequently allowed a new stringer-to-skin, aircraft wing       joint design to be proposed [6]: "Compound joints have become part of         the certification training material.
[Bristol's] 2 and 1/2         dimension model was used for A380 checkstress.
The way the Mode 1 and 2         contributions are decomposed in Stringer Run Out is used as a bonded         joint pre-sizing method" [b].

New structural analysis for shells exploited by NASA       NASA's Shell Buckling Knockdown Factor (SBKF) project was set up to "help         future heavy-lift launch vehicles weigh less and reduce development         costs" by generating new shell-buckling knockdown factors replacing       the existing ones which "date back to pre-Apollo-era studies &#8212; well         before modern composite materials, manufacturing processes and advanced         computer modeling" [i].
New, more accurate and less conservative       methods have now been developed for the design of shell structures for       space launch vehicles.
Estimated savings of the order of &#163;10M/launch are       expected with the first launch based upon these new design methods       anticipated from NASA Wallops in 2014.
Weaver was consultant for NASA from 2001-2010 with support funds from       NASA totalling around $450k.
