     Following research at King's College London (KCL) highlighting the       failures of single session post-incident psychological debriefing, there       was a capability gap for organisations that predictably place their people       in harm's way.
There was little evidence on the effective response to       staff's psychological health needs after traumatic events so KCL       researchers developed TRiM.
The accumulated evidence demonstrates that       TRiM allows `at risk' organisations to support their staff through the use       of evidence-based interventions, thereby ensuring that such organisations       are able to meet their legal and moral duties.
Military use of TRiM: While TRiM began in the Royal Marines,       following the results of high quality KCL research (later published in       Greenberg et al.
2010) it was adopted by all the UK Armed Forces from       2008.
Across the military, TRiM is now available to approximately 180,000       regular personnel and for many thousands of reservists whilst deployed.
The Royal Navy has a webpage dedicated to `Emotional Support' which         discusses its use of TRiM.
Their Operational Stress Management       Policy describes the background and delivery of TRiM in detail and       acknowledges the contribution of KCL by citing both background research       (Greenberg et al.
2003) and detailing how the programme was developed       based upon research findings (1a).
The Army also highlights its use of         TRiM on its website and testifies that TRiM "is a process that has       already been used on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the last two       years" and "has developed credibility among those it is intended for and       increased awareness of operational stress and detection of its effects"       (1b).
Over the last ten years, the UK military have operated in highly testing       environments in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Recent UK military health research       has shown that, in spite of the challenges UK troops have faced, military       personnel's mental health status has been relatively unaffected.
While it       is not possible to confirm what part the use of TRiM has had in generating       this level of resilience in UK troops, there are plenty of examples of       TRiM being mentioned in Hansard by politicians who deem it an important       part of the Armed Forces mental health support processes.
For instance, in       a 2012 debate on the mental health of former service personnel, the       Minister of State for the Ministry of Defence discussed how TRiM "is         helping to identify those at risk and provide support to them" (1c).
TRiM is now widely accepted as part of military mental health and it, and       KCL researchers, are featured on Government pages (1d) and the NHS Choices       website discussing this topic (1e).
Non-military use of TRiM: KCL TRiM research underpins the decision       of other organisations, such as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, to       use TRiM to demonstrate their commitment to deliver the best evidence       based support for their personnel (2a).
Over time its use has spread to       emergency services, security firms and media companies.
For instance, Kent       Police use TRiM to "assess the response of a member of staff exposed to a       potentially traumatic incident" (2b) and in 2011, Essex police issued         formal TRiM guidance as part of their established procedures (2c).
The security company Centurion Safety also use TRiM and train their Human       Resources and Occupational Health workers to use it "to risk assess the       needs of those who have been involved in a traumatic event and determine       what follow-up practical support is required" (2d).
Much of this training,       or similar, is provided by March On Stress, a company set up by Prof       Greenberg in 2001 and now the UK's leading commercial TRiM training       provider (2e).
Their clients include the BBC, where one journalist said of       TRiM that it "creates a safe, impartial and non-judgmental framework that       won't influence your salary or your next deployment" (2f).
Support for the use of TRiM in national and international guidelines:       As both the popularity and scientific evidence supporting the use of TRiM       has grown, so has the number of recommendations that it be used more       widely.
TRiM is recommended by the Department of Health for supporting       staff after they have dealt with disasters (3a, which cites a TRiM review       article by Prof Greenberg) and similarly, in 2008, NATO recommended         the use of TRiM for its personnel (3b).
Numerous emergency services,       including the NHS South Central Ambulance Service (3c) and the London       Ambulance (3d), use TRiM and have established supportive networks so their       TRiM trained staff can link up with each other to improve their service.
KCL researchers have met with and briefed military representatives from       several foreign nations about TRiM and the scientific evidence supporting       its use.
As a result, several nations have begun consideration of the use       of TRiM.
For example, the Dutch military now use TRiM (3e) and         TRiM has also influenced the US approach to traumatic stress management.
The US Army Medical Department use Traumatic Event Management (TEM), a       modified version of TRiM which was developed with the input of Prof       Greenberg (3f).
Discussions with KCL researchers about TRiM also led to the UK Centre for       Social Justice to recommend that the "benefits of military Trauma Risk       Management (TRiM) should be more widely distributed to civilian       organisations where there is an increased risk of exposure to trauma"       (3g).
