     The impact from this work is divided into two areas:       i) enhancement of the public understanding of genetics and stimulation of       public debate       ii) increased public participation in science.
The main beneficiaries of this research are members of the public, with       school-age children in particular being targeted.
i) Enhancing the public understanding of genetics       The grey squirrel is a controversial and a charismatic species which is       familiar to the general public.
The underlying genetics revealed by the       research is a new "text book" case of incomplete dominance, and has proved       to be an interesting and accessible example for the public to understand.
Indeed this example has been used in a recently published undergraduate       genetics text book written by Thomas [6].
This research has been followed enthusiastically by the media, locally       and nationally.
This began with the publication of an article by Thomas in       a local wildlife magazine in 2005 [7], while subsequent press releases       issued by ARU in April 2008 and January 2012 led to renewed and       significant media interest in the findings.
McRobie was first invited to appear in BBC1's `The One Show' in 2008 to       explain the genetic basis of melanism in squirrels, and has since featured       in numerous television and radio broadcasts explaining genetics to a wide       audience [1, 2].
Television appearances include BBC1's `Countryfile'       (22/03/09 and 13/01/12, approximately 7 million viewers each), `The One       Show' (14/05/08, 30/01/12 and 05/03/13, approximately 5 million viewers       each), `Inside Out' (21/01/09) and `Breakfast' programme (15/10/10).
McRobie was also interviewed for BBC Radio 4's `Shared Earth' and       `Material World' programmes (03/03/11).
Local television and radio       interviews have included BBC1's `Look East' and ITV's `Anglia News' (four       appearances each, 2008-2013) and `Gulf Radio Services', broadcasting to       armed forces in the Persian Gulf (27 and 29/02/12).
Coverage of the research has also appeared in the national press       including The Times (26/4/08 and 31/01/12), The Sunday Times       (27/4/08), The Daily Express (26/4/08), The Daily Telegraph       (26/4/08 and 31/1/12), The Daily Mail (26/4/08 and 01/02/12), and       The Week (11/02/12).
Finally, many national and international       websites (including American, Russian, Romanian and Indian websites) have       included articles on the genetics of the black squirrels [8].
Combined media exposure across these sources has reached several million       people [1, 2], with an estimated 45 million individual viewings (some of       these will be repeat viewings by the same people), contributing to a wider       understanding of genetic concepts.
This exposure has also publicised the       project website at www.blacksquirrelproject.org       [3] which contains accessible explanations of the genetics and underlying       molecular biology of squirrel hair pigmentation.
Additionally, the media       exposure has engaged and stimulated debate with the public, which can be       seen from the numerous independent websites with discussion forums and       blogs that follow black squirrel work [9].
Many of these reference ARU and       www.blacksquirrelproject.org.
The public understanding of genetics has been further enhanced by       outreach work, such as exhibitions and talks.
McRobie has curated       exhibitions for the Cambridge Natural History Society's (CNHS)       Conversazione (12-14/06/09) [4] and the University of Cambridge's Science       Festival (14-27/03/11) [5].
McRobie has also given invited talks on the       genetics of black squirrels to local wildlife groups: for example, CNHS       (11/09) [4] and Ely's Natural History Society (2009).
An important strand of the impact has been specifically on       schoolchildren, whose engagement with and understanding of genetics has       been enhanced.
This was initiated in 2008 with Thomas's article for Biological         Sciences Review [10], a magazine aimed at sixth formers.
McRobie has       also become active in presenting the fundamentals of genetics to       schoolchildren.
She appeared on BBC1's children's programme `Newsround'       where she was interviewed by children on the genetics of black and grey       squirrels (08/10/10).
She also spoke at primary schools during Science       Week in Cambridge (18/03/09 and 17/03/10) and delivered a lecture to       secondary school pupils at an event hosted by Cambridge University as part       of the `Aimhigher' initiative (04/03/09).
Her appearance on `The One Show'       (2012), as discussed above, was also the starting point for a genetics       lesson at Comberton Village College, Cambridgeshire for 12 year olds       (2012).
(ii) Public participation in science       The Black Squirrel Project, launched on BBC1's `The One Show' [1], has       been widely advertised through television, radio, newspaper, magazine and       internet coverage.
The website for the project, www.blacksquirrelproject.org       [3], was created firstly to inform members of the public about the       genetics of melanism in squirrels, and secondly, to enable members of the       public to record and comment on sightings of black, grey and red squirrels       in the British Isles.
The website is an interactive, public-access tool for data generation on       squirrel sub-population dynamics and also provides the public with       accessible information.
The website has received approximately 140,000       visits and more than 5,600 squirrel sightings have been recorded.
In       addition, more than 300 emails have been received via the website,       including some from members of the public in the USA, Germany and France       [3].
This demonstrates the public participation and impact achieved by       this research, across a wide range of age groups and communities both       nationally and internationally.
