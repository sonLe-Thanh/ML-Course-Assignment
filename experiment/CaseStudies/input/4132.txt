     In 2008, RVC contributed to the BBC1 documentary, Pedigree Dogs         Exposed, which attracted 3.9       million viewers, and was responsible for three separate reports being       commissioned into breed       issues [a].
The programme highlighted, principally, a welfare concern, but       noted additional       economic impact, in added costs of veterinary care.
It reported that       pedigree animals make up       75% of the seven million dogs in the UK (estimated in 2012 to be 9.4       million) and cost their owners       over &#163;10m in veterinarians' fees each week.
The chronic pain affecting       CKCS afflicted by       syringomyelia was presented as a particularly graphic illustration of a       more general issue, and the       writer and director, acknowledged the substantial contribution from RVC       researchers to produce       the programme and subsequently: "I made particular use of RVC work on         Chiari-like Malformation         and Syringomyelia in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels [...] RVC         researchers and research findings         were also extremely helpful in preparation of the follow-up documentary,         in 2012, which reported         progress but also ongoing concerns over these two [with BOAS] welfare         issues.
Amongst the         breakthrough developments since the original programme, I would single         out VetCompass for         providing the UK-wide epidemiological data necessary to monitor canine         health and welfare [...]         research originating from the Royal Veterinary College underpinned much         of the content of         Pedigree Dogs Exposed, ensuring the programme's claims could not be         dismissed lightly.
Furthermore, the lasting impact of the programme is due in no small part         to the College's continued         commitment to this issue."

The first documentary was highly influential: resulting in the withdrawal       of coverage for Crufts dog       show by the BBC and termination of support by the Dogs Trust, the Royal       Society for the       Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the People's Dispensary for Sick       Animals.
RVC's research and expertise was used in each of the resulting inquiry       reports [c,d,e], The reports       also noted a lack of quality data on prevalence of breed related health       problems.
The Executive       Summary in the report of the Associate Parliamentary Group for Animal       Welfare noted: "However,         there is a lack of information available about the scale of the problem         [health and welfare of many         pedigree dogs], which makes it difficult to obtain a clear picture of         what percentage of dogs are         affected.
As the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) has shown that the         problem is widespread to         different degrees of severity in many of the most popular breeds we         believe further action must be         taken immediately."
The Bateson inquiry included a call for       evidence, and in the report, points from       respondents included: "A long list of heritable diseases affected dogs,         but little or no hard data         were available on prevalence.
A few respondents pointed to the need for         a system to collect data         from veterinary surgeries, as being developed by the Royal Veterinary         College."
Each of the reports [c,d,e] concluded that current breeding practices       were detrimental to the       welfare of pedigree dogs.
The Kennel Club subsequently completed its       ongoing revision of its       breed standards for every breed individually [f].
The revisions specify       that standards "will not         include anything that could in any way be interpreted as encouraging         features that might prevent a         dog from breathing, walking and seeing freely".
For individual       breeds, the revisions frequently       include addition of `relatively', `moderately', `no exaggeration' and `not       excessive' and deletion of       `massive', to descriptions of breed characteristics.
Additionally, it       sought to limit inbreeding by       "refusing to register those puppies that are born from any mother/son,         father/daughter or         brother/sister mating, taking place on or after 1st         March 2009".
The Kennel Club's Genetics and       Health Information Manager acknowledges RVC's role: "RVC's research         into both the causes and         extent of breed-associated ill health and the extent of human perception         of these conditions, has         been extremely valuable in raising awareness and increasing         understanding of health and welfare         matters.
Its work with breeders and breed clubs internationally has         helped to ensure that the         research outputs are taken into account and deliver tangible benefit in         terms of a healthier dog         population."
[g]     An independent Advisory Council for welfare issues of dog breeding was       established in 2010, with       the support of the Dogs Trust, to pursue implementation of the other       recommendations of the three       reports [h].
Their Veterinary Director notes: "RVC... contributed to         the section [of the first annual         report] relating to breathing difficulties and the majority of the other         priorities (ocular problems,         syringomyelia, idiopathic epilepsy and heart disease) are areas in which         RVC research findings are         contributing to canine health and welfare."

The perceived `demonisation' of specialist breeders, and their initial       rejection of the PDE       documentary's claims, themselves created a barrier to improving welfare.
Consequently, the RVC       researchers have pursued a positive relationship with the pedigree clubs,       guided by outputs from       research into owners' (limited) perceptions of problems.
They have       developed partnerships with       associations representing CKCS and other affected breeds, aided by the       Kennel Club's       overarching support for liaison between breeders and veterinary       scientists, in order to involve them       actively in work designed to improve health and welfare.
Outputs from       VetCompass have       assisted, as anticipated by the inquiry reports, in providing firm       evidence for scale and scope of       specific problems.
The number of CKCS in the UK alone is estimated to easily exceed 65,000       (over 11,000 are now       registered in a single year), making it the 6th most popular       breed.
There are also breed clubs       across Europe, North America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.
All       are said to be       descended from six dogs.
Studies of relatively small selected groups       suggest that over 95% bear       the Chiari-like malformation and, the majority of these may go on to       develop SM.
Other disorders       in CKCS consequent on in-breeding are, unsurprisingly, common.
CKCS breeders' symposia, attracting around 60-70 participants were held       in 2006 and 2010 and       led to the Cavalier Club sponsoring research at RVC (see [2,3]), relating       to the mismatch of brain       and cranium size in CKCS.

Interim breeding       guidelines were       instituted, based on the research, discussion and report from the       international Cavalier Club round       table organised and hosted by RVC in 2006 [j].
Five years on from this,       independent research       showed a tangible impact on dog health and welfare: where a scheme was       implemented to screen       dogs by MRI.
Where it was possible to select at least one parent that was       SM-free at five years of       age, the incidence of young dogs with severe clinical symptoms was       reduced.
The analysis       showed 70% of CKCS offspring were unaffected by SM when both parents SM       free; 77% were       affected when one parent affected; and 92% affected when both parents       affected.
The publication       also commented: "One encouraging observation was that the proportion of         grade E (SM-affected         younger than 2.5 years of age) dropped from an average of 15 dogs per         year in years 2004 to         2006 to 11 dogs per year in years 2007 to 2009, that is, the breeding         guidelines may be achieving         the goal of reducing the risk of early onset SM, however, this         hypothesis would be needed to be         tested in a more vigorous study" [k].
A Kennel Club/BVA health       screening scheme for Chiari Mal-formation/Syringomyelia       in multiple breeds based on this pilot scheme was introduced in 2012 [l].
Thus work has progressed from demonstrating in-bred and conformational       health problems, to       highlighting the on-going ignorance of their effects [m], and involvement       by the research team of       breeders, owners and veterinarians, to determine the scale and specifics       of problems to drive       change in breeding practices.
