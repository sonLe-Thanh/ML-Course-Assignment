     The Live Music Exchange (http://livemusicexchange.org/)       was set up with support of a follow-on grant of &#163;119,064 from the AHRC to       develop knowledge exchange in the live music sector.
Three kinds of       activity were seen as necessary to support and improve music policy       making: information provision; events to bring stakeholders together;       expert input into particular decision-making processes.
As a source of information, LMX operates an online hub for promoters,       musicians, agents, researchers, educators, journalists, venue staff, local       authorities, national policy makers, technicians and more.
It provides:            blogs, posted weekly by members of the LMX team and guests, academics         and participants in the live music sector.
a digest of live music news,         originally as a weekly summary on the website now as a continuous         twitter feed;       access to a growing archive of relevant academic, industry and         government reports and other publications;       information about live music meetings, workshops and training events.
By August 1, 2013 the average number of site hits had reached       2,177 per month and LMX has 328 Facebook `likes' (people who get       LMX news feeds)&#8212;the majority of these are from the UK but 20 countries are       represented altogether.
The site has 290 Twitter followers at the       time of writing, the majority from the music industry: people involved in       training; officials in governmental organisations; officers of music       industry bodies and festivals, as well as individual promoters and agents.
There are 198 direct subscribers to the site, people who get email       updates of posts.
These are divided fairly evenly between the music       industry (all sectors, including musicians and local councils) and the       music and music industry education sector.
Through its online activities,       as indicated on the sites blog, resource and events pages, LMX has had an       impact in a number of areas:     1.
Training:     "The Live Music Exchange has been a positive and significant factor in         my professional practice.
I have recently been tasked with developing a         new live music module and LMX has enabled me to add a breadth and depth         to the learning and teaching that the module would otherwise have sorely         lacked.
It also provides me with a living resource to engage the         students in supporting their own growing interest in this hitherto         under-researched area."

Promoters' understanding of changes in their business:     "I found [the LMX] paper on the UK promoter landscape absolutely         fascinating, and shared it with our entire company.
I am very interested         to follow [its] research on the changing nature of the UK's music         economy and its relation to the global music economy.
With the majority         of non-American dates being booked from London, this is a very relevant         commercial story for the UK's music industry."
[text removed for       publication], Songkick and Detour] (5.2)     In response to the need revealed by research for stakeholders in the live       music sector to have a better knowledge of each other's interests and to       develop effective ways of dealing with conflict, LMX has co-organized a       series of issue-based events: on May 5, 2012 in Leeds (36       participants, on the problems facing a local live music scene); on       November 12, 2012 in Cardiff (40 participants, on the place of Welsh and       Welsh language promoters in the UK live music sector); on January 23, 2013       in Glasgow (33 participants, on the relations between venues, promoters       and local council officials); and on May 14, 2013 in London (71       participants, on the effects of digital technology on the relations       between the live and recorded music sectors).
These meetings have brought       together major commercial players in the field), small local promoters and       venue managers in the cities concerned, local councillors, planners, and       environmental health officers, representatives of arts organisations, the       organizers of such musical events as the Green Man Festival and the       Glasgow Jazz Festival, and representatives of new digital businesses such       as Spotify and SongKick.
The impact of these meetings has been to       establish new understandings and ongoing relations between different       stakeholders such as local council officials and venue owners (as has       happened in Glasgow) and between music administrators and entrepreneurs       (as has happened in Wales).

Provision of expertise     Members of the LMX team have provided their expertise on specific       live music research and policy issues in the following forms:            confidential reports on and interpretation of census data gathered by         Festival Awards, the Association of Independent Festivals and Guilfest         (5.4);       expert advice on the drafting of and relevant data for Lord         Clement-Jones' attempt to lift the leafleting ban, his Cultural and         Community Distribution Deregulation Bill (5.5);       advice on the problems of gathering and interpreting the statistical         data involved in measuring the value of live music for the UK Music         Report on Live Music and Tourism (5.6);       advice on the sourcing of and interpretation of live music data for         Creative Scotland's Review of the Music Sector (5.7).
A significant strand of the research underpinning LMX concerned the       nature of the impact of academic work on the music industry and the best       strategy for having such impact in a sector in which knowledge resistance       is more common than knowledge exchange.
The evidence of LMX impact is       therefore not only the effect of specific input into specific policy       issues, as listed above, but also the fact that LMX team members now have       a voice as academic researchers in high-level policy meetings.
For       example, LMX participated in a meeting organized by Music UK on the live       music sector in the House of Lords in July 2013 and the subsequent       meeting, brokered by LMX itself, to discuss the future of music industry       policy in Scotland, between representatives from UK Music, the Scottish       Music Industry Association, Creative Scotland and the Scottish Government.
Here impact takes a different form.
In the words of Lord Clement-Jones: "Live         Music Exchange's research impact takes the form of significant influence         on the way issues are perceived and evidence used in public         policy-making in the field."
