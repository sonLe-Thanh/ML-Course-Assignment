     The research described above has shaped and influenced international       mercury policy.
The combination of diverse expertise in the University of       Oxford's Department of Earth Sciences (i.e.
understanding of mercury       emissions and cycling; expertise in environmental remediation; and skill       in the use of science to inform environmental policy) led to the formation       of the IKIMP initiative in October 2008.
IKIMP was led by researchers in       the UoA, relying on their scientific expertise and contacts, and funded by       NERC.
Its aim was to ensure that scientific evidence and expertise was       used to inform public policy relating to mercury.
In October 2008, the EU banned exports of mercury with effect from March       2011.
This required that a report be submitted to the European Parliament       by January 2010, reviewing safe mercury disposal options.
Defra (the lead       UK department on mercury) asked the newly-formed IKIMP to gather       scientific evidence to help inform them of UK storage options and to       communicate the UK's position to the EC during preparation of its report.
IKIMP also worked with Defra and the United Nations Environment Programme       (UNEP) as they developed a legally-binding Multilateral Environmental       Agreement (MEA) to reduce global mercury use and pollution (the Minimata       Convention).
IKIMP helped develop robust policy guidance, and synthesized       science evidence, to inform negotiations at UN Intergovernmental       Negotiating Committees (INCs) leading to the Minimata Convention.
Between 2009 and 2011, IKIMP hosted three successful workshops, each       leading to the writing of influential reports on the science and policy of       mercury.
These workshops built on Oxford University research, and on the       reputation and contacts of Oxford University researchers.

Safe Storage and Disposal of Redundant Mercury       IKIMP's October 2009 workshop was the first international event to address       the question of mercury storage following the decision to draw up a MEA.
The resulting report was delivered to Defra, who sponsored the event.
Outcomes of this workshop and report include:     - Production of a decision-making framework for the safe management of       redundant mercury in developing countries; a framework quickly adopted and       built upon by UNEP;     - Presentation of a revised strategic framework for storage and disposal       of mercury to an EC meeting in Brussels in November 2009 [8];     - Influence on the 2010 EU report on safe mercury storage;     - IKIMP's presentation of the report at UNEP's first INC on mercury in       June 2010 [9];     - UNEP implementation of two Mercury Storage Projects in South America       using IKIMP's framework for decision making, following presentation to the       UNEP Inception Workshop on Mercury Storage and Disposal in Latin America       [10].
These developments marked the beginning of pre-ratification       implementation of the Minimata Convention.
A UNEP science advisor confirms       that IKIMP was, `extremely active in helping UNEP develop the decision         making framework for the long-term storage and disposal of redundant         mercury' [11].
The 2009 workshop and report drew on Holmes' science       and policy research, and were informed by the University of Oxford teams'       wider understanding of mercury behaviour in the environment.

Mercury arising from oil and gas production in the UK and UK         continental shelf       IKIMP co-hosted the sixth `Mercury Emissions from Coal' conference in       2009, which highlighted the lack of data on mercury releases from the oil       &amp; gas industry.
IKIMP published a subsequent report in January 2012       [7] drawing together all available data on mercury emissions from the UK       oil and gas industry, and identifying a paucity of data in the public       domain.
This report informed UNEP policy discussions, as confirmed by a       UNEP representative [11]: `when it comes to sources such as oil and         gas, the data are extremely limited.
In fact, the report by IKIMP is         perhaps the only recent and relevant report on this subject.
[It] is         used as the basis for the argument that the oil and gas sector need to         be encouraged to have greater representation during negotiations.'
The report has also been influential at national level.
For example, the       Director of the Center for Ecology and Economics at the Norwegian       Institute for Air Research, has used the report, `to convince [the] oil         and gas industry in Norway and Abu Dhabi ... to arrange projects that         will help estimating the contribution of this industry to the Hg         emission budgets' [12].

Current understanding of the global mercury cycle: implications in         the context of reducing anthropogenic emissions       IKIMP's second major workshop (Oxford, May 2011) brought together experts       to consider natural emissions and the global mercury cycle.
Discussion of       critical volcanic and marine mercury fluxes was directly informed by       University of Oxford research.
Defra representatives at the meeting sought       a document outlining baseline natural emissions of mercury and their       variability, to contextualize future guidance on anthropogenic mercury       emissions.
The resulting IKIMP policy-briefing document influenced a       subsequent UNEP INC on mercury.
A Defra's Senior Scientific Officer       confirmed that the document, `enabled policy makers to establish         practical emission and release objectives for the UN Convention'       [13].
A UNEP representative comments that, `the IKIMP work to evaluate         emissions from natural sources [...] and exposing the knowledge gaps in         the global mercury cycle has been a valuable tool when putting global         mercury emissions into perspective' [11].
Research and knowledge exchange activities led by Oxford University have       thus led to major impacts on national and international policymakers and       regulators, including helping to shape the Minimata Convention, which was       agreed by national governments in January 2013 and represents a       significant advance in global management of mercury.
Defra's Senior       Scientific Officer for Chemicals and Emerging Technologies states that, `IKIMP         has been very successful in transferring knowledge and technical         expertise to policy developers at national, European and UN levels.
It         has proved an invaluable asset in a wide range of negotiations and has         certainly helped expedite the development of the Minimata Convention.'
