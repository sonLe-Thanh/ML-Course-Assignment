     Brackenridge's most important contribution has been bringing together the       world's leading sport organisation-the IOC-and the world's largest child       protection agency- UNICEF- to use her research findings to develop abuse       prevention interventions.
This is significant for two main reasons.
First,       it has begun to embed international human rights and child welfare in the       international sport delivery system (through the IFs and NOCs); and       secondly, it has begun to transform the way that UNICEF and its partners       engage with children's sport.
The impact of Brackenridge's research on       these practice communities is reflected in:            the commitment of UNICEF's Chief of Child protection, Susan Bissell,         to adapt the General Measures that are used to evaluate the         implementation of the Articles in the UN Convention on the Rights of the         Child to incorporate prevention of abuse in sport (from 2010 onwards);       the IOC request for every National Olympic Committee to develop an         athlete protection and anti-harassment infrastructure (from 2007         onwards);       the home country Sports Councils' development of mandatory athlete         welfare and safeguarding standards by all government-funded sport         organisations (from 2003 onwards);       requests for advice about athlete welfare, policy development and         abuse prevention from international federations and UK government sport         agencies (ongoing);       the requirement for every BASES-accredited/chartered sport scientists         to undertake training in child protection (from 2004 onwards);       the mainstreaming of FA's Respect (behaviour improvement) programme         throughout the affiliated game (from 2008-09).
By 2009, 40,000 FA         coaches and Referees had received Respect training and 854 leagues had         committed to the Respect programme;       the evolution and adoption of welfare plans for all major youth and         school games events (e.g.
UK School Games);       awards: the USA Women's Sports Foundation/Darlene Kluka Women's Sport         and Physical Activity Research Award (2007); the Association for the         Advancement of Applied Psychology Distinguished International Scholar         Award (2008); an Honorary Doctorate of Science by the University of         Bedfordshire (2009) and Honorary Fellowship of the University of         Chichester (2010) and an OBE in 2012.
