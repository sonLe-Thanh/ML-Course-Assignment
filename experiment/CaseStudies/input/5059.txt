     KCRM research has made three important impacts on efforts by successive       UK governments to       reform regulation by making it more risk-based.
First, KCRM research has helped transform the basic principles of       regulatory inspection       and enforcement for the majority of UK regulators during the REF period       through its influence on       the recommendations of HM Treasury's landmark Hampton Review (5x),       which gained statutory       force in 2008 (5v: 5,7).
In particular, Hampton extensively cited       research and advice on       enforcement interventions by Fairman, Howard and Yapp (5x:         5;35;36;137;126,140) in support of       his key recommendation that all regulatory inspection and enforcement       should be made risk-based.
Fairman's research for the DTI on the benefits of risk-based enforcement       for retail premises       was also specifically highlighted in HM Government's full acceptance of       the `Hampton Principles'       (5xi:17), and she was subsequently seconded to the Cabinet Office       (2007-8) to lead work on the       implementation and the continuing roll-out of `risk-based' regulatory       practice.
The Hampton       Principles gained statutory force in April 2008 through the Regulators'         Compliance Code, which       tasked almost all government departments and regulatory agencies with       ensuring that their       regulatory inspection and enforcement activities were risk-based (5v:12).
For example, the Care       Quality Commission explicitly drew on the Hampton Principles as the basis       for refocusing its       inspection regime on the riskiest of the c.50,000 health and social-care       establishments that it       regulates (5iv:7).
As of 2011, some 36 regulators, with       responsibilities ranging from the       environment, financial services and football licensing to charities,       equality and human rights, had       filed Hampton Implementation Review Reports with the Department for       Business, Innovation &amp;       Skills (5vi).
Second, KCRM has also actively supported several government departments       in their       implementation of the Hampton Principles through targeted research,       training support and strategic       advice.
Government commissioned research by Fairman, Howard and Yapp,       which identified the       need for risk-based targeting of regulatory enforcement activities (3ii;3viii;3xi;3xv;3xvi),       provided       the main evidence base for the UK Food Standards Agency's (FSA) focus on       compliance drivers       and better use of tailored messages and guidance in its 'Enforcement and       Compliance Strategy       2010-15'.
Howard also led an FSA Social Science Committee working group in       2010 on the risk       factors shaping the prevalence of foodborne disease, the findings of which       significantly focused the       prevention efforts of the FSA's Listeria Risk Management Programme       (5a).
KCRM research has       also underpinned policy learning and training.
For example, the Better       Regulation Executive       recommends the monograph (3iii) from Rothstein's ESRC-funded       research on risk regulation       regimes as the standard academic text on risk and regulation for civil       servants (5i:9).
Defra's Better       Regulation training programme has also drawn on KCRM research it       commissioned from Rothstein       on the use of risk-based policy tools across Defra (5xiii).
Finally, building on an earlier successful       collaboration (3i), the Health and Safety Executive (HSE)       commissioned L&#246;fstedt to undertake       research and provide strategic advice to improve HSE's risk communication       practices (5iii).
Third, L&#246;fstedt's work on occupational health and safety led to his       appointment to chair his       2011 Independent Review of Health and Safety Regulation (5xii).
His evidence-based review has       had a substantial impact on that regulatory domain by persuading the UK       Government to maintain       and strengthen its use of risk-based approaches.
That achievement was       significant in a climate       where politicians and media commentators commonly disparage `elf`n'safety       madness'.
Even       David Cameron, before becoming Prime Minister, complained that the UK's       `over-the-top' health       and safety culture had created a `stultifying blanket of bureaucracy,       suspicion and fear' (5ii).
Drawing on detailed research, including the advice of Rothstein (5xii:103),       L&#246;fstedt concluded that       there was `no case for radically altering current health and safety       legislation' (5xii:1).
Nevertheless,       he identified five ways in which the risk-basis of the regime could be       improved (5xii:8-11).
His       recommendations gained support amongst all stakeholders and HM Government       committed to       implementing them in their entirety (5vii:9-15), as evidenced       below:     1.
Exempt the self-employed from health and safety law when their work         activities pose no risk of         harm to others.
- Status: The Deregulation Bill, announced in the Queen's Speech       in May 2013, will implement       this recommendation, exempting up to 800,000 people from the law.
2. Review all 53 Approved Codes of Practice (ACOP) to ensure that         unnecessary complexity does         not stand in the way of employers understanding and meeting their legal         obligations.
- Status: An HSE consultation on 25 June 2012 set out its       proposals for the revision,       consolidation or withdrawal of 15 of its ACOPs for delivery by 2013 and       proposed a programme       for the future review of the remaining ACOPs.
3.
Simplify health and safety law by reducing the number of         regulations by more than 50% and by         revoking regulations that have no impact on health and safety outcomes.
- Status: Twenty-one statutory instruments have already been       revoked and a consultation on the       revocation of a further twelve ends on 12 July 2013.
4.
Develop a binding national code of inspection and enforcement that         is consistent and targeted         towards the most risky businesses.
- Status: The Local Authority National Enforcement Code, which       sets out a risk-based approach       to targeting health and safety interventions, was published on 29 May       2013.
5. Review the scope for giving employers the right to contest civil         liability claims when they have         taken reasonable precautions to control workplace risks.
- Status: The Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act, which       received Royal Assent on 25 April       2013, changes health and safety legislation such that `strict liability'       provisions no longer hold       employers to be in breach of their duties when they have done everything       that is reasonably       practicable and foreseeable to protect their employees.
L&#246;fstedt was commissioned by HM Government to undertake a follow-up       independent One-Year-         On Assessment and Mark Hoban MP, the current Minister of Employment,       was `encouraged by the       positive endorsement [...L&#246;fstedt gave...] of the Government's progress       with health and safety       reform' (5ix: foreword).
Chris Grayling MP, the former Minister of       Employment, stated that `by       accepting the recommendations of Professor L&#246;fstedt, we are putting common       sense back at the       heart of health and safety' (5viii; see also 5b and 5c).
