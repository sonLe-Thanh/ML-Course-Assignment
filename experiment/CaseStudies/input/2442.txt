     Impact on health and welfare     Implementation of both anti-platelet and coronary interventional       therapies in ACS has led to major improvements in mortality rates.
Fox       demonstrated a marked improvement in performance measures for reperfusion       in ST-elevation myocardial infarction in 2008, across 21 countries in       Europe, compared with data from 2006: the number of eligible patients       receiving reperfusion therapy in a timely manner increased from 53.1% to       63.5% (P &lt; 0.0001).
In parallel, over the 2-year period,       in-hospital mortality decreased from 8.1 to 6.6% (P = 0.047) [5.1].
Furthermore, the UK Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project public       report demonstrated a decline in 30-day mortality for non-ST-elevation       myocardial infarction from 12.5% in 2003 to 7% in 2012 [5.2].
The       improvements in case fatality and acute outcomes have been independently       attributed to the innovations in care following the adoption of guideline       recommendations.
The data were corroborated by 2012 British Heart Foundation Coronary       Heart Disease statistics [5.3].
For instance most European countries       witnessed a 10% to 50% decrease in death from coronary heart disease from       1998 to 2008 (45% decrease in UK).
Impact on public policy     Clopidogrel was the first anti-platelet agent to demonstrate major       improvements in clinical outcome when added to aspirin.
Fox and       colleagues' landmark study [3.2] changed guidelines in the UK (National       Institute for Health and Care Excellence [5.4]), Europe (European Society       of Cardiology [5.5]; 55 countries have pledged to implement these       guidelines) and North America (American College of Cardiology       Foundation/American Heart Association [5.6]).
Further to Fox's       demonstration of the effect of genetic polymorphisms on the variable       clopidogrel metabolism among individuals, the US Food and Drug       Administration has, since 2010, recommended consideration of genetic       testing for clopidogrel [5.7].
Impact on clinical practice     Dual anti-platelet therapy and coronary revascularisation with PCI has       become the standard of care worldwide for all patients presenting with       ACS.
In 2010, there had been an almost 1000% increase in the number of       PCIs in the UK per annum since 1991 [5.3].
This was mirrored by a steady       rise in prescription of anti-platelet drugs since their introduction in       the late 1980s, up to 40,000 prescriptions in England in 2011 [5.3].
A collaborative meta-analysis led by Fox (2010) confirmed the long-term       beneficial impact of interventional revascularisation, demonstrating       2.0-3.8% absolute reductions in cardiovascular death or myocardial       infarction in the low- and intermediate-risk groups and an 11.1% absolute       risk reduction in the highest-risk patients [5.8].
Impact on commerce     Clopidogrel (marketed as Plavix&#174;) was described as a "blockbuster" drug       for its manufacturers Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi, generating US$6.5B       in sales in the USA in 2011, where it was the second best-selling drug       [5.9].
This ranking reduced when the US Food and Drug Administration       approved generic versions in 2012, but the drug now generates revenues for       multiple manufacturers worldwide (USA, Canada, Europe, India, Australia).
