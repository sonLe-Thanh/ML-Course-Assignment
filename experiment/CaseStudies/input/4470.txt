     Informing intercultural performer training worldwide     Zarrilli's psychophysical actor training process has achieved worldwide       impact on performers and training programmes through his award-winning       publications and international workshops.
The impact of Zarrilli's research into the actor training process is       demonstrated by the adoption of his work (both theory and practice):     - as part of the core curriculum at drama schools, including the Korean       National University of the Arts (Seoul), RESAD (Royal Academy of Dramatic       Art, Madrid, Spain) (5.2) and the Intercultural Theatre Institute in       Singapore.
The Director of RESAD attests that `Over 150 students have         been trained by me in Zarrilli's comprehensive approach [...] over the         last decade.
It has become an established line of work in RESAD's         Movement Department, and plays a central role in the curriculum for         Acting in Physical Theatre.'
(5.2)     - has been shared with three hundred people at Zarrilli's studio in       Wales, since 2000, bringing together professional performers and directors       from Amsterdam, Greece, Poland, Spain, Germany, Korea, Austria, US, Canada       and the UK.
- is unique in applying traditional practices to contemporary performance       problems: `Phillip opened me to an entirely different way to work with         my dance form'(5.3).
- has become a core practice for several independent performance       companies including Theatre Asou (Austria), Gaitkrash (Ireland) and       Theatre P'yut (Korea).
Zarrilli has delivered over twenty-five invited workshops worldwide since       2008 and is Resident Fellow at Freie Universitat Berlin's Research       Institute, 2010-2013.
Deepening the quality of artistic productions     Psychophysical actor training is core practice for Zarrilli's own       professional performance company, the Wales-based Llanarth Group whose       productions have entertained international audiences and received critical       acclaim.
Told By the Wind (3.3) (2009-11) toured to Wales, Portugal       and Germany with further performances (with workshop and discussion) at       The Grotowski Institute (Poland), and AMI Theatre, Tokyo, Japan.
A second       work, The Echo Chamber, was created with Arts Council Funding, in       Cardiff, 2012.
The award-winning series of Beckett productions, The         Beckett Project (3.2) toured to the Malta Arts Festival in 2012 and       continued in Cork with Play+ in collaboration with Gaitkrash at       the Cork Sculpture Factory (2011) and Cork Opera House (2012).
Loukes co-created and performed in the award-winning, critically       acclaimed (5.4) production The Idiot Colony (3.4) with her       company, RedCape Theatre, which entertained audiences at 92 public       performances at significant UK venues.
An Arts Council report records an       audience member's comment: `This is the most powerful piece of theatre         I have ever seen,' (5.5).
The project focuses on the combination of       professional training approaches from Gindler work and Asian       martial-meditation arts, offered by Loukes, with the methodologies taught       by other company members.
RedCape were one of only two UK companies to be       selected to perform at the ICA as part of London International Mime       Festival.

In 2012, the success of this led to       further ACE funding (&#163;75 000) for 1, Beach Road, with Loukes as       Dramaturg, touring nationally.
Enriching public appreciation of these through supporting material     Creating innovative and fit-for-purpose methods of documentation and       archiving of performance training, process, and practice is central to       sustaining and developing Exeter Drama's research.
Theoretical questions       and developments of best practice are part of our research infrastructure.
The work of Senior Research Fellow Peter Hulton in archiving and       documentation is practice-based research in its experimental and practical       investigations into appropriate modes of documentation.
Hulton's work on       Exeter Digital Archives (EDA), founded in 2004, is to create an       international spread of archives, brought together under one imprint in       order to acknowledge the dynamic range of contemporary performance       practice; these are available as a resource for performance practice       research.
Hulton has pioneered methods of documenting and annotating       performance, and has provided DVDs to accompany publications, pioneering       such use of audio-visual material.
His work is facilitated by dedicated       Drama Technical manager and technicians, employed full-time to support       uses of IT in the Department's research and teaching.
Hulton is 'One of the only people to attempt to document         performance practice on a systematic basis' and his `indispensible' work         at Exeter Digital Archives (5.6) has been seminal to a recent shift       within British publishing towards the distribution of audio-visual       material related to performing arts (conversations with Routledge       `inspired [the editor] to look seriously at the idea of creating [their]       own archive') (5.6).
Hulton was invited to join this editorial       board, and several of his recordings will be released in new editions in       the series.
Similarly, his involvement with Methuen publishing informs       their new audio-visual releases.
Further independent ventures have made       work of companies available internationally.
Echo Arts (Cyprus) note that       `All these projects added to the history of Echo Arts in international         exchange and further to our existing work on art across the divide and         art beyond borders.'

Two were published by the       Open University in 2008, one as course material (2,500+ copies),       distributed worldwide.
D. Hulton has worked with the EDA to       develop 12 education packs to accompany EDA documentation of Theatre       Alibi's work since 2001, including Why the Whales Came (2001,       2003), Teapot (2002, 2008), Wild One (2004), Bonjour         Bob (2005), How to Hug Trees (2006), Crowstarver       (Workshop pack 2006, 2012), Lost and Found (2007), High Muck a         Muck (2009), Flying Visit (2010), Deep Down Cowboys       (2011), Cabbage Heart (2012), and I Believe in         Unicorns (2013).
EDA's work for Theatre Alibi has been used by       teachers and students in numbers in the realm of 100,000, and the feedback       from teachers has been excellent.
