     Professor McAllister's research has generated significant and       wide-ranging impacts on the development of devolution in Wales since its       advent in 1999.
However, the impact detailed here occurred between 2008       and 2013.
The primary beneficiaries are politicians (Assembly Members,       party leaders and CEOs of the four main political parties); practitioners       and professional services staff in the Assembly and in wider civil society       (specifically, the Assembly Commission, the Presiding Officer, the Chief       Executive Officer/Clerk, chair of Business Committee, Remuneration Panel       chair, Chief Operating Officer, Director of Assembly Business, chairs of       the scrutiny committees); political correspondents in the broadcast media       and press; and other academics.
Improved governance, operational and service provision within         devolution     Following McAllister's identification of flaws in the initial devolution       settlement, she was invited to undertake a 14-month secondment to the       Assembly Commission in 2008-9.
At the instigation of the Presiding       Officer, Lord Dafydd Elis-Thomas and the CEO/Clerk, McAllister conducted a       comprehensive review of the operation of the Assembly Committees with a       brief, set by the Assembly Commission and its Business Committee, to       ensure that the overall political capacity of the Assembly was best       utilised.
McAllister's research also led to her appointment as expert       advisor to the Independent Review of Politicians' Pay and Support for the       National Assembly for Wales,     2008-9 and input to the All         Wales Convention Report whose recommendations referenced issues     from McAllister's research around constitutional workability and capacity     constraints.
The findings from McAllister's research were used to guide     changes in parliamentary and political business practices to improve     capacity, notably:            An induction and professional development programme for Assembly         Members was introduced;       The Assembly Commission's budget for induction, training and personal         development of Members and their staff was substantially increased;       Changes were made to the operation of Assembly Business in plenary and         Committees, including timings, frequency of meetings, agendas, terms of         reference and membership; and       Changes were made to the system of remuneration, pensions and expenses         for Assembly Members.
For example, Getting it Right for Wales (2009), the report of the       Independent Review Panel (above), reflects the research and advice based       on it given by McAllister to the Panel, particularly on Assembly Members'       training, development and support services (Chapters 3, 4 and 9,       especially).
Many of the key recommendations of the Panel, for example,       improved investment in induction, training and development of elected       members, appropriate staffing configurations and consistent and equitable       remuneration have subsequently been implemented.
This work has also had impact in other jurisdictions elsewhere in the UK       and beyond: McAllister's research was used, for example, by the UK       Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority in its review of MPs'       expenses, 2009-2010, and as context for Parliamentary reviews elsewhere       (e.g.
the Northern Ireland Independent Financial Review Panel appointed in       2011).
The reconfiguration of the legislative framework for devolution     Within each stage of legislative change from the first, to the second and       third devolution `settlements' - and from White Paper to Bill to Act to       referendum - there is clear evidence that McAllister's original research,       critiquing the sustainability of the first settlement and identifying       capacity challenges, has played a significant role in shaping the       subsequent constitutional developments.
Alongside Lord Richard, McAllister was co-author of the Richard       Commission Report 2004, described by the Deputy Presiding Officer as "the       most authoritative, constitutional report ever commissioned by a       government in the UK."
It is widely acknowledged as the benchmark critique       of the first settlement and McAllister's work is especially evident in       Chapters 2,4,5,9 and 12.
Some of its recommendations stimulated the       Government of Wales Act 2006; others remain unimplemented but continue to       frame the thinking of political practitioners.
McAllister's evidence to the Scrutiny Committee on the White Paper       `Better Governance for Wales', which drew on her early research to propose       a series of changes to the first Government of Wales Act 1998, was quoted       extensively by MPs and Peers as the subsequent Bill (leading to the 2006       Act) made its parliamentary passage.
Capacity reviews, especially of candidate selection procedures in the         political parties in Wales     McAllister's research on capacity issues has also had an impact on       political parties in Wales: three of the four main parties invited       McAllister to lead advisory sessions on i) capacity management; and ii)       election candidate selection, especially on methods and approaches to       assist capacity through promoting a diverse slate (in terms of gender, age       and ethnic origin).
Two parties have since reviewed their recruitment       procedures on the basis of the seminars led by McAllister and one       continues to liaise with McAllister with regard to producing a wider       diversity strategy linked to acknowledged inelastic capacity constraints.
McAllister's impact and influence has been recognised through further       appointments.
She has been called as an expert witness on the further       devolution of powers to the National Assembly by the Commission         on Devolution in Wales, established by the UK Government in 2011.
She has also produced further follow-on practical `think-pieces' for the       Assembly Business Committee, delivered specialised Continuing Professional       Development/Knowledge Exchange sessions to the Assembly, and has been       awarded &#163;1.5K as part of the Institute of Welsh Affairs' UK's Changing         Union project to develop further her work on political capacity.
