     Dr Arag&#227;o's research has had impact at global (United Nations), national       (Colombia), and state (Acre &#8212; Brazil) levels, informing the design and         implementation of environmental policy to regulate fire usage in       Amazonia, underpinning the development of new monitoring tools to         assist policy makers in the region, and has influencing         methodological developments within the United Nations REDD (Reducing       Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing       Countries) programme in Colombia.
In Amazonia, fire has been routinely used to clear primary rainforest,       but has major ecosystem, carbon cycle and land management implications.
Research undertaken by Dr Arag&#227;o has strongly influenced the design and       implementation of new `zero fire' policies and regulation within       the State of Acre, Acre being one of the 9 Brazilian Legal Amazonia       States, and covers an area of ~164,000 km2 (larger than England       and Wales together).
Since 2008, the Brazilian Public Ministry has been       working to eradicate fire usage for land management, a campaign that       ultimately led to a Civil Action in April 2011 to curb the use of fire in       land clearance by 2011.
Arag&#227;o's research was used to support this legal       action by the Brazilian National Public Ministry and the Public Ministry       of Acre State against the State of Acre Municipalities and relevant       environmental bodies.
Dr Arag&#227;o was the only UK-based academic quoted in       the legal action, and evidence is provided both in the Legal Action       document listed in Section 5 (evidence item #1), which is also       publically available at the official website of the Brazilian Public       Ministry (http://www.prac.mpf.gov), and in a letter from the Attorney of       the Republic at Acre State (evidence item #2).
This action has led       directly to improved management of fire risk in this region, with recent       data from the Brazilian National Institute of Space Research's fire       monitoring system showing that the Civil Action has been responsible for a       reduction of 49% in fire occurrence in Acre State in 2011 and 2012 in       relation to the decadal mean (2001-2010).
This positive result then allowed Arag&#227;o to secure (in Dec 2011) the       support of Acre's government Institute for Climate Change (see evidence item         #3), for the development of the PULSE tool (Platform for       Understanding Long-term Sustainability of Ecosystems) in a collaborative       project funded by the NERC and Sao Paulo State Research Council in Brazil.
This project is specifically aimed at supporting policy makers to       analyse, visualise, and understand the interactions between climate,       ecosystems, and human health in Amazonia.
The knowledge gained through the       body of research is being integrated into a web-based platform by       scientists and government agents in a participative effort to facilitate       decision-making processes and long-term environmental planning, and to       directly improve public awareness on the impacts of fire and       drought on carbon emissions in the Amazon by making the tool publically       available.
Arag&#227;o's work (Arag&#227;o &amp; Shimabukuro, 2010) has also changed         awareness of policy makers on the critical importance of       considering fires in relation to the international REDD policy framework.
Arag&#227;o's scientific findings have, since 2011, been used as scientific       reference in reports by the United Nations (UN) Ecosystem Program and the       United Nations Food and Agriculture Program to help design the REDD+         environmental policy within the UN- REDD program (see evidence items       #4, 5, 6).
This has global implications for strategies to mitigate       climate change impacts by reducing carbon emissions from land use change       and for safeguarding tropical biodiversity.
Based on Arag&#227;o's findings,       REDD authorities are now aware that reducing deforestation in tropical       nations alone does not warranty the permanence of carbon stocks.
Rather,       the success of REDD concepts depends upon redesigning policies to       accommodate mitigation of fire occurrence.
In this context, Arag&#227;o has       contributed as a Scientific Advisor (since 2009) to the development of       Colombian government policy on reducing carbon emissions.
In       particular, research on methodologies to measure carbon changes in forest       biomass (see Section 3) was fundamental to influencing the Colombian REDD+       pilot program's standards and guidelines for quantifying and monitoring       carbon stocks in Colombian forests.
Arag&#227;o's participation as the only UK       scientific advisor (Oct 2009) at the meeting Technical and Scientific         Capacity to Support REDD projects in Colombia directly assisted the       implementation of the Colombian's REDD+ methodological framework, leading       to impact on policy development for a national government and United       Nations REDD+ program (see evidence item #7).
The output of this       action was the creation of the Colombian REDD+ policy protocol coordinated       by the Colombian's National Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology, and       Environmental Studies and the Ministry of Environment.
This protocol was       subsequently presented by representatives of the Colombian Official       Committee at the Conference of the Parties 17 to the United Nations       Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in Durban on the 2nd of       December 2011 (see item #8).
Finally, through attention from the Brazilian and international media       that has disseminated Arag&#227;o's research findings widely, the body of       research outlined in Section 2 has increased the awareness of the         general public and policy makers on drought and fire issues in       Amazonia.
This has occurred through quotes in several broadly disseminated       News channels, including the BBC.
Arag&#227;o has also been interviewed by       renowned Brazilian newspapers to comment on fire problems in Brazil and       featured on BBC News at 10 commenting on the 2010 drought impacts in       Amazonia (see items #9).
In addition, Arag&#227;o's work on carbon       assimilation has been cited in the Brazilian Government Panel on Climate       Change report (see item #10), which is a major vector to inform       public and policy makers on climate change impacts, mitigation and       adaptation in Brazil.
