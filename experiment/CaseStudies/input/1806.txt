     For some time, bullying has been recognised as a serious problem within       schools.
The impact of       Boulton's programme has been to keep bullying on the policy agenda, and to       influence and inform       the on-going anti-bullying work of practitioners working with young       people, notably teachers, and       hence to ensure that as many young people as possible are protected from       the negative effects of       bullying.
That impact can be traced from Boulton's research findings in       scientific journals via policy       initiatives and documents to public benefit.
Here, we focus on the latter       two links in the impact       chain.
Influence on policy: intermediate impact     As noted above, the underpinning research has been original, high quality       and wide in scope.
It       has informed many UK and overseas government and NGO policy initiatives       and documents, and       hence has considerable reach and significance.
The sheer number of       references made to       Boulton's work attests to its substantial influence.
These references are       contained in documents       that are widely available via the internet to all interested members of       the public, including school       staff, other professionals, parents and young people themselves.
These       documents and resources       allow people to enact the provider organisation's anti-bullying policy       directives; in short they inform       people about bullying, how to tackle it, and support victims.
They       include:             Characteristics of bullying victims in schools.
A document on         the U.K. government's           Department for Education website that makes reference to Boulton's         finding that social skill         deficits may put pupils at risk of being bullied (page 20).
Respecting others: Anti-bullying guidance.
The main Welsh           Assembly government document,         available via its website, to disseminate its anti-bullying policy and         to guide anti-bullying action by         schools and other interested parties.
It refers to Boulton's work         showing that bullying is not related         uniformly to all types of maladjustment (pages 10 and 46).
Bullying Prevention and Response Base Training Manual published         by the U.S. government via         its stopbullying.gov website.
It makes two explicit references to         Boulton's research (pages 41 and         50), that have revealed the self-perpetuating association between being         bullied and psychological         distress, and the tendency of many children not to tell anyone when they         are bullied.
In addition,         the manual makes numerous points about bullying that stem from other         work carried out by         Boulton.
Research briefing: School bullying.
A UK-wide NSPCC         resource that underpins the charity's         commitment to an anti-bullying policy.
It cites Boulton's work that has         shown: (i) how teachers often         fail to recognise all forms of bullying (page 6), (ii) the relative         frequency of different sub-types of         bullying (page 7), (iii) the potentially serious effects of being         bullied (page 9), and (iv) the         importance of underlying attitudes (page 11).
Keeping safe: Establishing the need to teach "keeping safe"           messages in primary schools in           Northern Ireland.
An NSPCC document for practitioners in Northern           Ireland and beyond that         highlights to professionals and others the role of anti-bullying         initiatives in wider attempts to keep         all children safe from harm.
It refers to Boulton's finding that         relationship abuse compromises a         broad range of wellbeing indicators, including self-esteem, anxiety,         loneliness and depression         (pages 7 and 42).
Keeping safe: The views of principals, teachers and other school           staff in relation to teaching           "keeping safe" messages in primary schools in Northern Ireland.
Another NSPCC resource (there         are others not listed here) that refers to Boulton's work on         associations between bullying and         psychological adjustment (pages 7, 63, 69).
Bullying prevention is crime prevention.
A policy document and         anti-bullying practitioner guide         that acknowledges the synergy between bullying and crime.
It is         available from the influential U.S.           charity Fight Crime: Invest in Kids.
It cites Boulton's work on         the effects of bullying on victims         and draws parallels with the effects of crime (page numbers not         provided, but see citation 13).
Influence on practice: ultimate impact     It is through such documents and resources that Boulton's research has       continued in the REF       census period to inform and update the anti-bullying knowledge and       practice of potentially       thousands of teachers, other professionals working with young people,       parents, children       themselves etc.
It is recognised that tracing explicit links between any       given piece of disseminated       research and a change in practice in relation to something as complex as       bullying is difficult.
However, as noted above, it is the breadth of Boulton's research outputs       that have been cited in       such a wide range of influential policy documents and resources that       corroborate a claim to that       impact.
Moreover, the `user-friendly' resources aimed directly at young       people, parents, teachers,       etc.
do NOT cite academic references.
However, the content of those       resources clearly IS based       on the kinds of publications that do cite Boulton's work, listed above.
In addition to the aforementioned broad impact, we offer the following       examples of how pupils       continue to be protected from bullying as a result of Boulton's work via       the training for school staff it       has led to.
Central to any school's efforts to address bullying is an       anti-bullying policy (ABP).
To be       effective, an ABP must be updated regularly.
A series of events and       meetings, attended by senior       managers, have been hosted by Boulton (e.g., http://www.chester.ac.uk/anti-bullying).
Informed by       his recent research at the University of Chester, these addressed several       key themes that have       been taken up by schools as they renewed their ABPs.
Themes included:       (i) the central importance of the teacher-pupil relationship in tackling       bullying and supporting       vulnerable victims, and how these can be nurtured       (ii) why, despite our best efforts, many pupils do not befriend or support       victims of bullying, and       what can be done to change this       (iii) how some attempts by adults to help victims may have unintended       consequences that leave       victims feeling even worse, and how to avoid these     By making sure their ABPs are abreast of current research, schools offer       their pupils optimal levels       of `protection' against bullying and its pernicious effects.
Current       projects being carried out by       Boulton are examining more directly how these kinds of policy changes       impact on pupils' bullying       behaviour and well-being.
Boulton's research with pre-service teachers (Reference 1, above)       revealed important deficits in       their confidence and competence in dealing with cyber bullying.
As a       direct result of this work, all       initial teacher training programmes at the University of Chester now       incorporate training and       personal reflection exercises that are designed to prepare them to deal       effectively with cases of       online bullying among pupils.
The latter provides a clear link between       Boulton's research and the       social support that these trainee teachers can provide to bullied pupils       when they take up posts       within schools.
