     The main output of the research project was a successful public       exhibition Madness and Modernity (April-June 2009).
A major loan       exhibition with about one hundred objects, it made a strong contribution       to the Wellcome Collection's exhibition and public engagement programme in       2009, which `takes medical history out of its niche and welds it to big       ideas' (David Jays, Arts Journal, April 2009).
The significance of       the exhibition lay in its challenge to prevailing assumptions about       attitudes to mental illness in Vienna in the 1900s, displacing Freud as       the central figure of this period and extending public understanding of       the influence and significance of innovations by modernist architects and       designers in the treatment of neurosis.
Integrating art, design, film and       the material culture of psychiatric therapeutic equipment in innovative       ways, the exhibition included a double-screen video immersive installation       by award-winning filmmaker David Bickerstaff, of the `Narrenturm', showing       interiors of the 18th-century `Tower of Fools', a cylindrical       Viennese mental institution.
Bickerstaff writes that the exhibition       provided a number of further commissions and opportunities for his work,       at the Wellcome Collection and elsewhere.
(Testimonial 1)     It attracted 44,000 visitors, an average of 559 per day, which exceeded       the Wellcome Collection's expectations.
The Wellcome Collection has       provided examples of visitor comments which include: `Beautiful exhibition       to understand that what is considered mad or not sane is actually more       normal and natural than anything else'; `A very interesting exhibition,       many unexpected aspects, suggesting all kinds of links'; `Sad but most       interesting &#8212; beauty and talent and ignorance'; `I was impressed by the       articles preserved.
Viewing the exhibition with a nurse gave the       exhibition context and I felt attachment to the content'; `There is a lot       to learn from the care to detail in our current psychiatric environments';       `Reminded me of Ellis island with its layers of history and personal       stories and tragedies.
Absolutely brilliant pieces of reconstruction/       presentation of a completely marginalised section of Viennese history/art       history'; `As someone with bi-polar and many members of family also I was       interested in the attitudes of others.'
(Source 6)     The accompanying exhibition catalogue, Madness and Modernity: Mental         Illness and the Visual Arts in Vienna 1900, edited by the curators       Gemma Blackshaw and Leslie Topp, was published with support from the       Wellcome Trust and AHRC, in English and German.
Published by Lund       Humphries in 2009, the catalogue sold 1284 copies in the UK and       internationally.
The images and videos from the exhibition remain on the       Wellcome Collection's website.
The exhibition received extensive media coverage, in both general and       specialist (medical, health design architectural) publications, recorded       in a substantial press book collated by the exhibition curator at the       Wellcome Collection.
It was highlighted in over 20 `critics' choice' lists       and also featured on BBC Radio 4's Front Row (31/03/2009) and Saturday         Review (01/04/2009), and BBC World Service (01/04/2009).
It featured       in the review of the week in the British Medical Journal       (11/04/2009) and was described as `a must-see' in The Lancet       (23/05/2009) (Source 7).
It was also well-reviewed in Austria (Source 7).
Summarising the Wellcome Trust's appreciation of the exhibition and its       reception by visitors, the chief curator of the Wellcome Collection       states, `We know from the length of time visitors spent in the exhibition,       from the volume of enquiries generated and from visitor comments       collected, how engaging the exhibition proved to visitors.
Addressing the       relationship between mental illness, the visual arts and architecture, the       exhibition attracted many with a particular interest in one or other of       these areas.
It is clear from the visitors' comments recorded that a       common experience was delight both at the depth of research and also at       the surprises the exhibition contained.
Those with a particular interest       in the visual arts enjoyed discovering about the architecture and       psychiatry elements of the show.
For those with an interest in mental       health there were also many surprises.'
(Testimonial 2)     Topp's research on architectural and design modernism and psychiatric       institutions prompted much favourable and detailed comment from       journalists and from professionals in these fields.
The wider impact of       this work was exemplified subsequently as follows:             Museums Journal interviewed Topp and quoted her extensively for         an article on innovative approaches in guest-curated exhibitions (Issue         109/2, Feb. 2009, pp.
28-33) (Source 9)       The Wien Museum commissioned a revised version of the exhibition         (curated by Dr Blackshaw and Sabine Wieber (Birkbeck between 2005-8 as         post-doctoral Research Associate) from January-April 2010.
In the         preface to the German version of the exhibition book, the Director of         Museums of the City of Vienna wrote `The London exhibition is being         shown in Vienna under the original English-language title `Madness &amp;         Modernity', in order to emphasise that it offers, quite deliberately, a         view from the outside on a Viennese cultural phenomenon.
The concept         developed by Leslie Topp and Gemma Blackshaw has been adopted,         therefore, without changes.
The exhibition, with its unfamiliar and         sometimes also controversial approach to seemingly well known themes         should inspire discussions and offer ways of transcending well-worn         patterns of interpretation.'
(Testimonial 3 and Source 10)       The purchase of Karl-Josef R&#228;dler's works (some shown Madness &amp;         Modernity), for his collection, `Museum of Everything' (Testimonial 4)       In November, 2012, Dr Topp was asked by the president of ICOMOS         (International Council on Monuments and Sites) Austria to write a report         supplying a comparative analysis of Steinhof Psychiatric Hospital         (delivered 20/12/2012) for submission as part of a bid to have the         hospital included in the UNESCO world heritage list and save it from         radical changes due to private development.
The report was submitted to         the mayor and vice-mayor of the City of Vienna, and helped to inform         discussions at a meeting on the future of the Steinhof area with         stakeholders.
