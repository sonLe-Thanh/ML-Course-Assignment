     The immediate impact of the research was the acknowledgment by Pfizer       Animal Health (now Zoetis) of the connection of BNP to the use of the       PregSure BVD vaccine in the dam, which led to the withdrawal of the           vaccine from sale in Europe and elsewhere in the world (5.1).
Despite the vaccine being withdrawn, cases of bleeding calf syndrome       continue to be found in some calves born to dams that have been       historically vaccinated.
In addition, reporting has increased due to       increased awareness of disease and Zoetis subsidising post-mortem       examinations.
However, as an indirect measure the number of cases being       diagnosed at post-mortem at SRUC fell by 42% between 2012 and 2013 (SRUC       post mortem figures).
The Recognition of BNP as a truly novel disease and characterisation of       the disease was translated into impact through the following means:            Dissemination of our findings through publication in the veterinary         press (5.2,5.3,5.4), delivery of talks (Association for Veterinary         Teaching and Research Work Congress 2010, British Cattle Veterinary         Association Congress 2011, Vet Trust Conference 2013) and widespread         press coverage (5.5, 5.6) allowed rapid transfer of information to the         veterinary profession and farming community allowing prompt recognition         of cases.
Findings contributed to the Defra BNP working group.
That group         generated a case definition for the disease which was used in further         large-scale epidemiological studies (5.7, 5.8)       Findings contributed to recognition and characterisation of the         disease at a European level (5.9)       Cases of BNP were reported by the veterinary profession through the         pharmacovigilance system.
The demonstration that cases of BNP can be prevented by colostrum       substitution allowed dissemination of practical advice through the       veterinary press that enabled farmers to prevent many further cases of the       disease (5.10)
