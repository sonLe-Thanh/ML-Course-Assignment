     Our research has had the following distinct Impacts:             Adoption of Law-Proof Risk-Related Approach to Tender Design:         Following our findings on         contract standardisation and the recommendation that tender evaluation         criteria be transparently         defined, the Welsh Government established a Procurement           Implementation Board in 2010 to         create the Supplier Qualification Information Database (`SQUiD') tool.
As a result of our findings,         public purchasers using SQUiD move from a pro-forma approach to         tender design, to a new law-proofed         SME-friendly, risk-related approach.
This was immediately adopted by 64         public sector         bodies in Wales.
SQUiD has been used more than 150 times to date,         including by NHS Wales,         Gwynedd County Council, Carmarthenshire County Council, Rhondda Cynon         Taff Council and         Pembrokeshire County Council.
In 2012, Jane Hutt, the Minister for         Finance, mandated all 109         public sector bodies to use the approach advocated by SQUiD [b2, b3,           b6].
Since the introduction         of SQUiD, the proportion of major Welsh public sector contracts being         won by Welsh businesses         has increased from 1/3 in 2010, to 2/3 by 2013 [b9].
Less Welsh         public sector spend has therefore         been `lost' to competitors located outside of Wales.
Judicial Review Impact/Legal Compliance Impact: The SQUiD         promotes the adoption of         transparent tender evaluation criteria in line with recent European         Court of Justice Case Law set         out in the Barriers research.
Unlike England, Scotland and         Northern Ireland, there have been no         judicial review cases in public procurement originating in Wales, a         testament to the transparency-         generating behaviour that now encourages procurers in Wales to describe         the tender requirements         and evaluation criteria clearly at the tender design stage.
Changing Government Policy to bring Transparency to "Low" Value           Procurement: As a         result of our Barriers research, we recommended that all public         contracts should be transparently         advertised once they exceed &#163;25,000 in value.
This recommendation was         adopted by the Welsh         Government in 2009.
As a result, the annual number of public sector         contracts valued at less than         &#163;130,000 advertised on the National Sell2Wales website increased         by 81% between 2009 and         2012[b2, b10].
Over the same period, public sector requests for         quotes publicly advertised         increased by 150% [b2].
NHS Wales followed suit in 2010, and         adopted our recommended         contract advertising threshold of &#163;25,000 [b2], resulting in a         major increase in transparency of         commercial opportunities for SMEs seeking to win NHS business.
In 2012,         the Minister mandated         this Barriers Recommendation such that all of the Welsh public sector         must adopt it [b6].
Changing Government Policy for the entire Public Sector:         In Dec. 2012, Minister Hutt         mandated the adoption of the recommendations of the Barriers         research in the Welsh         Government's Welsh Public Procurement Policy Statement [b6].
This followed the August 2012         McClelland Review "Maximising the Impact of Welsh Procurement Policy         which labelled the         Bangor Law School Barriers research as outstanding and seminal [b2,           b7].
Our research changed         Government policy from an `Opt-in' to a Mandatory approach for         the Welsh public sector [b2, b6].
Achieving Significant Low Value Procurement Progress: Our         research with Carmarthenshire         County Council in South Wales and Gwynedd County Council in North Wales         (combined spend         &#163;265m per annum) has yielded dramatic results in terms of reducing         tender procedure process         time to around 38 days, whilst the UK Government targets a 120 day         tender award timescale (i.e.
a           66% improvement on the UK Government's target).
Significantly,         using the "Bangor simplified open         procedure", both Councils have reduced the length of their tenders by         over 80%.
The reduction in         procurement officer input to a mere 20 hours from start to finish has         saved each Council significant         time and money in tender design, development and assessment.
This         represents a substantial         efficiency gain.
This is also very welcome to SMEs as shorter tenders,         accompanied by speedier         tender award decisions, are crucial.
Carmarthenshire Council are now         rolling out the "Bangor         simplified open procedure" for all spend up to &#163;75,000.
Other Welsh         Local Authorities are also         expected to follow suit [b2, b4].
International Adoption of Bangor Research: The Office of Small         and Medium Enterprises         within the Public Works &amp; Government Services Canada have modelled         their tendering         methodology on the TRI [b5].
The TRI methodology has been         extensively used within 11 Local         Authority regions in Ireland since 2011.
In 2013, the Enterprise Europe         Network (Flanders) cited         the TRI as the perfect methodology for improving tendering success         rates.
SME Tendering Competency Development based on our research: The         Welsh         Government's Business Wales-Tendering refers to the Tender         Review Instrument in the         "How2Tender" workshops they deliver to Welsh SMEs.
It has been praised         by Value Wales (Welsh         Government Procurement Division &#8212; b2) and the Confederation of         British Industry [b3], as well as         by the Federation of Small Businesses.
The TRI is enhancing tendering         training provision to Welsh         businesses: the TRI findings have directly fed into, and form a         significant part of, the widely praised         "Advanced How2Tender" 2013 Welsh Government training module/workbook run         by Business           Wales &#8212; Tendering.
Cardiff University are referring to the         TRI in their procurer feedback letters [b2]         and Value Wales are recommending that all public sector organisations         should refer to it [b2].
The         Project Director, North Wales Procurement has also welcomed the value of         the TRI to SMEs         seeking to improve their tendering competency and success rates.
In May         2013, the Economic         Ambition Board for the alignment of current Local Authority Supplier         Development Services in         North Wales proposed that the TRI should be adopted extensively         throughout the region [b2].
Using our research findings, SMEs &amp; Social Enterprises have           increased their tender           success rates: Dynamix, a Swansea based social enterprise with a         workforce of 14, used the TRI         and won the Welsh Government National Procurement Award (March) 2013 for         "Most Improved         Supplier" in tendering.
Following TRI use, within 1 year, its tender         success rate doubled from 20%         to 41%, accompanied by a financial turnover increase of 36%.
Even more         significantly, they were         successful in joining 4 lucrative framework agreements that have secured         their future (having not         succeeded in joining any before), allowing them to safeguard their         employees' jobs and indeed to         award pay rises.
The second and fourth placed suppliers in the Welsh         Government National         Procurement Awards (Advent Project Management and Arwel Jones         Associates, both micro         businesses) were also TRI beneficiaries (the latter's win rate increased         from 11% to 50% following         TRI intervention) [b1, b2, b3, b5].
