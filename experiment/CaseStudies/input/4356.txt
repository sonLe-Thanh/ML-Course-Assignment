     The impact from MOLPRO in the REF window has been primarily economic and       can be quantified through sales of MOLPRO to academia and industry       throughout the REF window, as follows (data provided by Cardiff       University): &#163;1,783,714 (January 2008 &#8212; July 2013).
The main       contributors to the economic impact are academic users but just over 10%       have been commercial users and companies, contributing &#163;203,480,       as of 31 July 2013.
These include organisations such as Cilag AG (a Swiss       pharmaceutical firm), BASF, Hitachi, Nissan Chemical Industries, DE Shaw       Research (a computational biochemistry research company) and Schrodinger       (a software company).
Evidence for the impact of MOLPRO on facilitating research by commercial       users includes that from BASF.
BASF conducts research into fields such as       theoretical chemical modelling as part of its ongoing product development       process, which requires a high-performance computing (HPC) platform.
A       Group Leader in Quantum Chemistry at BASF and current user of MOLPRO       states:     "MOLPRO and in particular its capability for very accurate         computations on large molecules, has become a valuable tool for         estimating thermochemical and kinetic data for substances and reactions         involved in our development of new materials and processes."
Further evidence of the importance of MOLPRO to BASF comes from a 2009       INTEL document describing a project in which MOLPRO, as a "key       application", was test run on an INTEL Xeon processor 5500 series, with       the new platform driving improvements in time performance of the program.
Furthermore, a user at DE Shaw Research, has written the following       related to their work on drug design:     "The issue of force field accuracy is even more critical in our work         on problems of drug design, which require a very accurate description of         protein-small molecule interactions.
Here we are taking the approach of         developing new force fields from scratch, adding force field components         to account for polarization, charge penetration, and other physical         effects not typically included in existing biomolecular models.
We have         used MOLPRO extensively to generate the data necessary for fitting these         more complex biomolecular and small molecule force fields.
The wide         variety of methods available in, and performance and flexibility of, the         MOLPRO software make it key to our force field development efforts in         general, and to the development of improved force fields for small         molecules in particular.
We expect these projects &#8212; in which MOLPRO         plays an important role &#8212; to help foster collaborations with industry in         the area of drug development."
The role of the Birmingham-based research to this impact is shown by its       important contribution to the current MOLPRO package, as evidenced as       follows:     (i) UoB research [Refs 1, 3 and 4] being highlighted in the recent review       article on Molpro [Ref 5], in particular DF-LMP2, which is used to "speed         up the treatment of exchange, using localized orbitals, and local         subsets of fitting functions for each orbital product.
In large         molecules, this can significantly increase efficiency without much         affecting accuracy".
(ii) UoB research being cited in the current version of the Molpro manual       (see www.molpro.net) where it is       written: "...The heart of the program consists of the         multiconfiguration SCF, multireference CI, and coupled cluster routines,         and these are accompanied by a full set of supporting features.
The         package comprises.... local density fitting methods, as         described in [Ref 4]...".
Also it is written: "...Depending on         which programs are used, the following references should be         cited....Density fitting methods: DFT, Poisson fitting: [Ref 2]...         DF-MP2, DF-LMP2: [Ref 4]..."
