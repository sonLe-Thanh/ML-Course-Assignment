     Overview of Impact     During a public reading at University of York in June 2013 Seamus Heaney       spoke of Haughton as a `custodian' of poetry, as well as `a servant of the       art of poetry &#8212; and servant of the audience of poetry'.
His words       recognise the impact of Haughton's career-long commitment to bridging the       gap between academic study of poetry and a wider audience in raising the       public profile of poets.
Haughton's research focuses on poets' uses of the       resources of language to re-negotiate and re-define the boundary between       the public and personal.
In doing so, he has created a tight link between       his research and his advocacy for the cultural importance of poetry.
The       impact of Haughton's research has been felt on local, national and       international stages.
The beneficiaries include: broad non-academic         audiences at literary festivals and in York, publishing houses       and their readers, the media, a Paris gallery, the       city of Margate and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.

Beneficiaries     Created a local and regional forum to raise the profile of         contemporary poetry       In line with the University and Department's commitment to local cultural       life, Haughton has had a significant impact on public audiences in         York.
The impact of Haughton's research has contributed to raising       the profile of contemporary poetry in York, generating intellectual       exchange and engagement between major poets and the local public, and       providing an exciting literary forum for performance, discussions, and       reflection on poetry.
As the founding director of Writers at York, he has       worked since 2006 to create an established and ongoing venue for and       programme of readings by poets.
Writers at York readings have typically       attracted audiences which include local teachers, school pupils, writers       and members of the public more broadly.
Since the establishment of the       university's York Festival of Ideas in 2011, Haughton has ensured the       prominent participation of poets, from those with local reputations to       influential international writers, in this high profile venue.
Haughton's critical and interpretative work has helped establish close       ties with contemporary poets and therefore bring major British and Irish       poets to York to introduce them to the general public.
Major poets who       have read in the Writers at York include (with year and audience numbers):       Lavinia Greenlaw (2009: 85), Simon Armitage (2010: 130), Don Paterson       (2010: 105), Andrew Motion (2011: 220), Alice Oswald (2012: 120), Ciaran       Carson (2012: 115 and 2013: 88), Justin Quinn (2012), Peter Robinson and       Marie MacInnes (2012: 65), John Wilkinson (2013: 70), and Bernard       O'Donoghue (2013: 60).
The audience for Seamus Heaney (2013), who was       hosted jointly by Writers at York and the Festival of Ideas, numbered over       720 people.
Feedback on the Heaney reading attests to the value the local       community places on having major poets are part of the cultural life of       York.
One member of the audience relished `the opportunity to hear a       world- renowned poet on my doorstep', and another hearing `a great poet       presenting his own work in his own way'.
Others commented on the reading       as `moving and memorable' and noted `Seamus Heaney in York &#8212; very special       for all age groups in the community'.
(#1)     Increased Public Knowledge about Poetry: National and International         Literary Festivals     Through participation in literary festivals, Haughton has also worked to       extend the impact of his research to public audiences nationally and         internationally.
Haughton has spoken about his research on Eliot and       letters, his work on contemporary poets, and war poetry at festivals in       the UK and abroad (including Oxford Literary Festival, 2008; St Andrews,       2009; Little Gidding, 2009; and Galway, 2011).
In May 2013, he gave the       British Academy Warton lecture on English Poetry at Senate House as part       of the British Academy's London Literature Festival.
This took the form of       a poetry reading by Alice Oswald followed by a lecture by Haughton on       Poetry and Rivers, exploring the background to Oswald's representations of       rivers in earlier poetry as well as her work.
The lecture and reading was       attended by a mixed, largely non-academic audience of up to 120 people The       lecture has been uploaded to YouTube as well as published in The TLS       and received coverage in Chinese on the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences       website, which has a non- academic as well as academic readership,       attesting to the wide reach of Haughton's contribution to the London       Literary Festival.
(#2)     Brought Major Literary Texts to Wide Publics     In his editions, all published by non-academic presses (Faber and       Penguin), Haughton has successfully presented poets and their poetry to a       wide reading public.
His editions of Carroll's Alice's         Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, and       Second World War Poems re-animated key monuments of the national       literary heritage, enabling readers to re-experience and re-situate their       significance and relevance.
The public impact of Haughton's editing is       evident in his outstanding sales figures.
Haughton's Second World War         Poems has become a standard popular anthology of the poetry for       World War II, selling over 3710 copies.
His edition of Alice's         Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass,       which includes the most important poetic and fictional texts of Lewis       Carroll, has had exceptional worldwide sales of 315,921 copies in       paperback, and 64,431 in hardback (with 90,000 in 2010, the year of Tim       Burton's film).
In addition to the reading public, the publishing         houses Faber and Penguin have benefited directly from Haughton's       research and promotion of the public role of poetry.
(#3)     Influenced the Representation of Poetry by the Media     Haughton's editorial scholarship and critical work has directly shaped       how the media positions poetry as a central part of literary       heritage of the UK, Ireland, and the USA.
Haughton's edition of T.S.
Eliot's letters attracted wide       attention in non-academic and popular publications with high visibility       and cultural influence in the UK and the USA (including The Daily         Telegraph, The Times, The Evening Standard, The         Financial Times, Private Eye and The San Francisco         Chronicle and The Wall Street Journal).
The Telegraph       wrote that Haughton's edition gave `admirers of the inspired poet...the       full portrait of a man living with the esteem of having written The         Waste Land.'
In November 2009 the actress Fiona Shaw discussed the       letters on the Today Programme on BBC Radio 4, a programme with 7.18       million listeners.
In addition, their publication was extensively covered       in influential, non-academic journals such as The New Yorker (in a       10-page article by Louis Menard) and The New Republic (in an       8-page article by the leading poetry critic Helen Vendler).
The American Jewish         Daily Forward drew readers' attention to the relevance of Haughton's       edition for contextualizing the poet's troubling anti-Semitism.
(#4)     Haughton's The Poetry of Derek Mahon raised the profile of       this major, but until recently, relatively neglected Irish poet.
Haughton       subsequently worked with the media to raise Mahon's public visibility.
Based on his personal and archival research, he was invited by the       director, Roger Greene, to be interviewed for and take part in a       documentary TV film about Mahon's work: Derek Mahon: The Poetry         Nonsense, which also included Michael Longley and Seamus Heaney.
The       film was funded by the Irish Film Board and Arts Council, RTE/Channel 4,       premiered at Cuirt Arts Festival, Galway and in the National Library of       Ireland, and Synge Theatre, Trinity College Dublin, 2009.
It has also       played in Kinsale and the National Film School, Dublin.
According to the       director, in Q &amp; A sessions at these showings, `There were a lot of       questions directed at me on researching the documentary and what reference       sources were used.
[Haughton's] book was cited every time'.
(#5)     Worked with Centre for Modern and Contemporary Art, Paris     Haughton's research on poetry and cultural value led to an invitation       from Judith Clarke (London College of Fashion and renowned international       curator) to contribute to the exhibition Chlo&#233;: Attitudes.
Clarke       has written that `I have read Professor Haughton's work on poetry for many       years.
He inspired research a few years ago when I attended his wonderful       Professorial lecture in York on Poets' letters, and I looked to him early       on in the curatorial process as a fundamental collaborator'.
Held in the       Palais de Tokyo, Centre for Modern and Contemporary Art, Paris, in       2012, the exhibition marked the 60th anniversary of the famous       fashion house associated with Karl Lagerfeld.
Drawing on new       material from the Chlo&#233; archives and his research into the poetics of       naming, Haughton contributed an essay to the catalogue (published in       French and English) and attended the gala opening along with leading       figures in the fashion world (press coverage in Vogue and Harper's         Bazaar).
The exhibition was attended by 35,000 visitors and the       catalogue sold 3,000 copies in English and French.
Thus Haughton's       research on poetry shaped the way the Centre for Modern and         Contemporary Art represented fashion history and reached a wider       public, including the fashion industry.
(#6)     Adviser to Thanet District Council: Listing Historical Building         Associated with T.S.
Eliot     In his role as editor of Eliot's letters, Haughton advised on the       successful campaign to have the Nayland Shelter in Margate, where Eliot       drafted Part III of The Waste Land, listed and saved from       demolition, helping commemorate Eliot's poetic and cultural legacy in a       local civic context .
(#7)     Poet-Laureate Consultation     Haughton's status as an established expert on poetry and place in the       life of the nation led to his being one of those consulted in December       2008 by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport about the       appointment of the first woman Poet Laureate, Carol Anne Duffy.
