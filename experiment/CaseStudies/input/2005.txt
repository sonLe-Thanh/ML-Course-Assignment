     Since 2008, the University of Oxford's work on GPUs has had both economic       impact and impact on practitioners and professional services, via       improvement of existing software and the provision of consulting services.
The beneficiaries are NAG, NVIDIA, the Apache Foundation, and the large       number of people who use the improved software produced by these       companies.
The impact has been achieved through the transfer of software developed       by Giles as part of his research.
This has gone into libraries developed       and maintained by NAG, NVIDIA, and Apache.
With NAG and NVIDIA, this came       about through long-standing research collaborations and personal contacts.
In the case of the Apache Foundation (which develops open-source       software),the organisation asked for Giles' software as a result of       reading his papers.
The first impact of this research was on the Numerical Algorithms Group       (NAG) and through their subsequent dissemination of the software to the       financial industry.
NAG is an Oxford-based world leader in the development       of mathematical computer software libraries, whose products are used       worldwide in both academia and industry.
NAG and Giles have long-standing       connections, including the recent development of a wholly new GPU-based       library [B] targeted at the needs of the finance industry.
The Vice       President of Sales at NAG states [A] "Thanks to your contributions, we         developed the GPU random number generation library quite quickly; I         think you were responsible for over half of the original code before it         went into our quality assurance process".
He further states that "It       [the NAG GPU library] is being used by two major banks and two others         have purchased related consultancy services and training....We have also         benefited indirectly from this project, for example one major Tier 1         bank made a significant licence upgrade of ~&#163;100,000 and this upgrade         only became possible by NAG establishing new contacts within the bank         through our GPU work.
It is important that we are seen by our customers         as being at the cutting edge of scientific computing research, and our         work in areas like the GPU library is key to that and does help us to         keep existing customers and bring in new ones; over the past 3 years the         percentage of top banks who use our software has increased to 60%."
NAG report [C] that the French bank BNP Paribas reported excellent speed       up results (between 150x and 240x relative to a single-threaded CPU       simulation, depending on the number of simulations).
Giles has contributed fundamental software components to two of the       NVIDIA's mathematical libraries for sparse linear algebra (CUSPARSE) and       random number generation (CURAND) [D].
Both are integral to many       scientific applications using NVIDIA's GPUs, without which the scientific       applications would be unable to take advantage of the acceleration       hardware in the leading supercomputers.
The inverse error function routine       (erfinv) is now part of their standard mathematics library, while the       Sobol quasi-random generator is part of the CURAND random number       generation library.
The implementation of the mrg32k3a pseudo-random       generator is based on [2] referenced above, and the sparse matrix-vector       product (spMV) routine was put into the CUSPARSE library to replace the       previous version developed internally by NVIDIA.
Both of these algorithm       libraries were developed and analysed at Oxford.
The spMV routine is also       a foundation for NVIDIA's new NVAMG solver, an algebraic multigrid solver       which is the basis for a new GPU version of Ansys' Fluent computational       fluid dynamics (CFD) software, in turn probably the leading commercial CFD       solver worldwide.
This illustrates the layered nature of software       development, with high-level packages addressing specific applications       layered on top of lower- level, more generic, more fundamental software.
The Senior Manager for CUDA Libraries and Algorithms at NVIDIA states in       his support letter [D] "It is clear that high quality efficient         software libraries are important to users implementing their algorithms         on our hardware, and if we did not have our CUDA libraries then NVIDIA         would not hold the powerful position within HPC which it does.
This is         well illustrated by the fact that the Titan system at Oak Ridge National         Laboratory, the top supercomputer in the world according to the Top500         list, is based on our new Kepler GPUs.
Other indications, quoting from         our CEO's keynote presentation in the 2013 GTC conference [E],         are that in 2012 we sold 100M CUDA-capable GPUs, and the CUDA         development kit, including all of the libraries, was downloaded 1.6M         times.....Although it is hard to quantify the impact, indications of our         appreciation of the impact of your work are that we made you one of our         inaugural CUDA Fellows in 2008 (there are still only 11 worldwide and         you are the only one in the UK), and we made Oxford University a CUDA         Centre of Excellence (CCoE) in 2012".
This award included a donation       of $100k to support undergraduate research internships, and hardware       donations with a value of approximately another $100k, with further       donations likely in future years.
Finally, the inverse error function approximation software has also been       adopted by the Apache Software Foundation for its Java-based Apache       Commons Math library [F].
This has widespread use across numerous sectors,       where it is used to convert uniformly-distributed random numbers into       normally-distributed random numbers for stochastic simulations written in       Java, in application areas as diverse as financial option pricing,       biochemical reaction modelling, engineering uncertainty quantification,       and the simulation of groundwater flow in nuclear waste repositories.
