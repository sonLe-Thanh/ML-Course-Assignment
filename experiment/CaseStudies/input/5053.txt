     Research at the Division of Imaging Science &amp; Biomedical Engineering,       KCL has led to the development of a platform for guiding cardiovascular       catheterisation procedures in patients with atrial fibrillation.
In 2005,       the Division initiated their collaboration with Philips Healthcare on a       joint research and development program focused on image-guided arrhythmia       management, to translate this technology into a clinical product that       allows the integration of pre-acquired MR and CT images with real-time       X-ray fluoroscopy funded jointly by the Technology Strategy Board (TSB)       and Philips Healthcare.
The end result &#8212; the EP Navigator &#8212; was brought to       market in 2008 and directly resulted from initial work carried out at the       Division [2,3].
The package comprises an automatic CT 3D segmentation       package (EP planner) and the CT overlay software (EP Navigator) [9a, 9b].
The partnership between KCL and Philips has enabled Philips to       incorporate KCL innovations into the field of electrophysiology, with a       strong focus on translating technology into clinical practice.
The       collaboration has also complemented Philips' focused internal R&amp;D       programmes by enabling earlier-stage, more exploratory research.
As a       result of the collaboration, many features of image-guided interventions       developed at KCL have been integrated into the EP Navigator product [9]:            EP navigator Rel.3 (2010): Automatic registration of 3D CT/ATG.
Automatic alignment of 3-D models and X-ray images [4]              EP navigator Rel.4 (2011): Automatic respiratory motion compensation                Compensation for the moving heart [5,6]              EP navigator Rel.5 (2012): Automatic fluoroscopy catheter tracking,         integrated activation and voltage mapping based on sparse sampling [6,8]                Display of electrical information              EP navigator Rel.6 (2013): MR based 3D myocardial scar overlay for         AF/VT ablation and CRT guidance [7]                Ability to see already damaged or ablated areas                 The EP Navigator has led to a range of further products from Philips,       including the Heart Navigator [9c].
KCL is currently working with       Biotronik, EP Navigator's distributor in Europe, to establish a training       centre at St. Thomas' Hospital, London.
This integration into a commercial product platform has allowed broader       dissemination of KCL technology into the world-wide healthcare market, as       well as enabling multi-centre trials to study the clinical outcome of       improved treatment procedures.
Two of the important impacts brought about       by use of the EP Navigator are the reduction of radiation dose and       procedure time [10a] which lead to less patient morbidity and lower       healthcare costs.
Recent studies have also demonstrated the clinical       utility of EP Navigator [10b] with the clinical outcome for patients using       EP Navigator being similar to that of other leading navigation systems       [10c].
Accordingly, out of approximately 2,000 centres worldwide that       carry out ablation therapies for cardiac arrhythmias, the EP Navigator is       currently used in around 350 centres, despite strong competition from       other products.
The EP Navigator has also been replicated and       commercialised by the other leading manufacturers of cardiac       catheterisation laboratories, including Siemens Healthcare and GE       Healthcare.
Discussion of the Philips EP Navigator has spread to the general public       as it has been featured in two documentaries on British television: BBC       TV's Horizon &#8212; How to Mend a Broken Heart [11a] and Channel 4's Brave New       World With Stephen Hawking &#8212; Health [11b].
