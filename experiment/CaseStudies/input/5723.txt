The development of new catalysts       can lead to more efficient, sustainable, cost-effective processes; those       developed in Bath have been translated rapidly and effectively into       industrial processes.
This direct reach into major players in the global       plastics industry underpins the impact of this work.
The Bath chemistry, the intellectual property pathway and product         development       Three classes of titanium and zirconium catalysts for plastics manufacture       have been developed at Bath and patented, covering manufacturing processes       for the important polymers poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET),       poly(urethane) (PU) (with plastics markets worth $23B and $33B,       respectively, in 2010) and, more recently, towards use in improved       processes for poly(lactic acid) (PLA).
Crucially, these catalysts are       based on titanium and zirconium rather than tin, antimony or mercury, thus       eliminating the environmentally unfriendly heavy metals from       the catalysts used in these large-scale industrial polymerisation       processes.
Demonstrating the impact of this work involves a detailed following of       the original Bath-invented intellectual property but also derivative       patents and processes advanced by the partner industries and their       successors (ICI Synetix, Johnson Matthey; [A]).
The impact outlined here       focuses on PET and PU.
Developing commercial applications of the third       strand of Bath Group 4 catalysts (for PLA manufacture) is more recent,       with patent applications in 2006 (Johnson Matthey; [A]) and a recent       collaboration with Corbion Purac leading to implementation of       Bath-developed benign tin-replacement catalysis for pilot scale PLA       manufacture and patent filing in 2013 [A].
A critical element of the Bath       research is not only the specific catalysts developed in the published       work but the fact that these innovations, and the sharing of the       intellectual property with Johnson Matthey, through extensive       collaboration and a Royal Society Industry Fellowship for Davidson,       resulted in the methodology from Bath heralding a new, more sophisticated       molecular approach to catalyst design in the PET and PU areas, thereby           influencing the development of the whole metal alkoxide Johnson           Matthey catalyst portfolio.
The Bath-developed materials have       been described as "first in class", and have also resulted in the       establishment of rigorous molecular design process in the industrial       environment [B]:     "In addition to the specific catalysts and IP ..., the methodology         from Bath influenced the whole JM Ti- and Zr alkoxide catalyst         portfolio, including establishing the rigorous molecular design of these         families of materials, and the Bath Chemistry and materials are         acknowledged as being "first in class" in this area.... there is thus no         doubt that many of these developments including the whole VertecTM         and SnapcureTM portfolio can be linked directly         to the Bath research."
In March 2011 Dorf Ketal, an Indian Chemicals company         who are one of the largest in the world, purchased PET and PU catalyst         intellectual property from Johnson Matthey in a &#163;4.6M       transaction [C]; this income can be directly           attributable to the Bath research [B].
Due to the high value       of the product portfolio, the sale of the order book was blocked by the UK       Office of Fair Trading [D].
The intellectual property covered titanium       citrate-based Vertec catalysts first characterised by Bath that are used       in PET manufacture and the titanium alkoxide 'Snapcure' catalysts       developed from Bath chemistry and used in PU manufacture.
Dorf Ketal       rebranded these products as part of their Unilink range and they are now       manufactured at their new Mundra plant in India:     From Dorf Ketal release [E]: "the plant will produce up to         10,000 metric tons of the industry's broadest portfolio of titanates         annually, making it the largest facility of its kind in the world.
The         Mundra plant joins the company's recently expanded Dadra plant in         shipping TYZOR&#174;, and VERTEC&#8482; organic titanates worldwide...In April         2011, the company acquired the patents, trademarks and related         intellectual property for VERTEC&#8482; polyester catalysts and SNAPCURE&#8482;         polyurethane catalysts".
Implementation in Industrial Processes       The titanium citrate-based catalysts first characterised in Bath have       successfully replaced antimony in PET fibre and film applications, with       initial impact in bottle resin (PET is the main material used in drinks       bottles) with significant environmental and process benefits.
In addition,       the price of antimony catalysts has recently escalated rapidly due to       mining restrictions in China such that there is now an additional       significant upsurge in take-up of titanium-based catalysts from a cost       basis.
Large-scale manufacturers have made substantial process       improvements in PET manufacture that allow good quality titanium-based       PET; Dorf Ketal are supplying to this market.
For example, a new       ThyssenKrupp Uhde (Germany) process makes PET through a route in which       Vertec titanium-based catalysts are the best on the market by far at       matching antimony catalyst performance.
These PET catalysts are part of       the portfolio taken on by Dorf Ketal, to supply some of the largest PET       resin plants in the world (&gt;600 tonnes per day currently with up to       1500 tpd planned) [B]; conversion in these plants results in substantial       reduction in antimony usage.
The Snapcure (now Unilink) solution has also been implemented widely for       PU [F], with significant trials run with a number of large mercury       catalyst users including full scale trials.
This new process, based on the       molecular design principles introduced by Bath, is increasingly relevant       due to the onset of REACH regulations, which are, increasingly, severely       restricting the use of mercury.
These new Bath-developed catalysts have       thus had impact through their adoption in manufacturing processes, as a       replacement for undesirable heavy metal catalysts (notably antimony and       more recently mercury).
In addition to their adoption in manufacturing       plants, aspects of these catalysts and associated processes have been sold       on internationally, providing evidence that this chemistry is of ongoing       value and impact.
