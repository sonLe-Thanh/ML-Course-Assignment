     Governments around the world are striving to find ways of driving up the       quality and efficiency of public services.
The local government reforms       pursued by the Labour Government between 1997 and 2010 are widely seen as       one of the most ambitious reform programmes to date and have attracted       considerable attention in the UK and internationally.
By evaluating their       impact and similar initiatives by the Scottish Government, the studies       conducted by CLRGR researchers have provided an evidence-base for future       policy making and had a direct and significant impact on the way in which       governments in England and Scotland assess the performance of local       authorities.
In the first interim report from the meta-evaluation, published in 2005       (`Meta-evaluation           of the Local Government Modernisation Agenda: Progress report           on service improvement in local government'), CLRGR       researchers concluded that the assessment process in England needed to be       more targeted and place less of a burden on local authorities.
This       finding was reiterated in the final report, published in 2009 (`The         state of local services: performance improvement in local government').

The then Labour Government announced two       major policy changes in the 2008 white paper `Communities           in Control: Real People, Real Power''.
Firstly, the number of "centrally-imposed         performance indicators" was reduced "from 1200 to 198" and       secondly, "the Best Value Performance Indicators and Performance         Assessment Framework indicators" in England were replaced by a new       approach, the Comprehensive Area Assessment5.2.
The white paper       was presented to parliament in July 2008 and the new policy took effect       from 2009 [text removed for publication].
In the same year, the       Conservative Party's Policy Green Paper, `Control           Shift: returning power to local communities', took a       direct quotation from the 2005 report to evidence low satisfaction rates       among the public with regard to local authority performance, using this to       support its manifesto pledge to reduce the level of top down inspection of       local authorities5.3.

CLRGR's 2008 report for IDeA came at a time when the Local Government       Association (LGA) favoured a strong self-improvement approach to       assessment.
The report (`Getting           better all the time?')
thus "both enhanced what was already         in train and provided some good data and analysis for driving the         arguments further"5.4.
The IDeA particularly valued       CLRGR's experience "across the UK jurisdictions"5.4.
By       providing "a strong analytic framework", the research "became         the under pinning for the next stage of work and policies that were         already in train across local government"5.4.
One example       of this was the launch of the LGA's sector-led approach to improvement; in       this case, the CLRGR's report for IDeA was used to provide background for       the consultation on this change (`Setting           the Pace: Developing a Framework for Sector Led Help', 2009)5.5.
These reforms have now been implemented throughout English local       government.
In Scotland, the recommendations of the CLRGR's evaluation of the Best       Value Audit process (presented in a report entitled `Decisive           Moment: The independent review of the Best Value Audit Process')        were accepted in full by the Accounts Commission shortly after publication in       2007, and by 2010 were being used to "underpin the Best Value         improvement process and the design of the second round of best value         audits (known as BV2)"5.6.
The introduction of BV2 has       helped Audit Scotland "to deliver a more proportionate and better         targeted best value audit than was the case in the first cycle of audits"       with the report being "an important factor in driving a more integrated         approach to audit and inspection ... drawing on effective         self-evaluation within public bodies"5.7.
A particularly       important development, identified by Audit Scotland as something which       would not otherwise have been done, was the introduction of peer       involvement.
This element of the process was subsequently introduced to       the Fire and Rescue Best Value audit work and was something that Audit       Scotland feels added to the "credibility" of the audit teams and       has contributed to the "increased transparency" of how audit       judgements are reached5.7.
Reflecting on the long-term       implications of those changes, the research findings "helped to create         momentum around improved joint working with [their] scrutiny         partners, with an outcome-based approach to audit and inspection which         has continued to this day"5.7.
A study published in 2008       and commissioned by Scottish Ministers also made use of the 2007 report in       an assessment of the work of the 32 local authorities in Scotland to       promote equality between disabled and non-disabled people5.8.
The 2012 evaluation of peer challenge was cited by the Government in its       written         response to the pre-legislative scrutiny report by the Draft Local       Audit Bill Committee: "Cardiff Business School has completed an interim         evaluation of the Local Government Association's peer challenges.
It         found that the peer challenge teams had the right mix of skills and         experience and councils welcomed a challenge that was tailored to their         needs.
The Government therefore does not see the need for a further         review of sector-led improvement" (2013: 17).
The research described has achieved considerable reach because of the way       in which it was developed, with findings being debated with senior civil       servants, auditors and local government officers throughout.
Activities       included policy briefings with civil servants, presentations to: the       Society of Local Authority Chief Executives Annual Conference (2008);       civil servants attending the DCLG's Analysis Week (2009); the ESRC Public       Services Programme Policy Maker's Briefing (2009); the Audit Commission's       Annual Research Conference (2009); the Audit Commission's Board (2010);       the New Local Government Network Seminar on Future of Performance       Assessment (2010); and chairing the DCLG workshop on `Localism,       Value-for-Money and the New Policy Agenda' (2010).
The research featured       in the lead article in an edition of SOLACE Foundation Imprint (2008) (`Getting           so much better all the time'), which was distributed to all       senior local authority managers, and in articles in the Local Government       Chronicle.
The research was highlighted in an article which appeared in       the Guardian newspaper in February 2008 (`A           Marriage of Convenience'), demonstrating recognition by the       media of its relevance to the general public.
The reach of the research was further extended both indirectly, through       the researchers' involvement with think tanks, and directly, through       advisory roles which brought them into regular contact with policy makers;       these provided an important means of feeding the recommendations into the       policy making process.
Martin was a Director of the IDeA (2003-2010) and a       member of the steering committee of the Society of Local Authority Chief       Executive's Foundation (2008-2010).
He was also a member of the board of       the New Local Government Network (2007-present), the leading think tank on       local government policy and acted as an advisor to a report it published       which used CLRGR's work (`Through the Looking Glass: Putting Citizens         at the Heart of Assessment' July 2010)5.9.
Downe and       Martin were appointed to the UK Government's Expert Panel on Local       Governance in 2009, and Martin gave evidence to the Communities and Local       Government Select Committee enquiry, Audit         and Inspection of Local Government (2011)5.10.
The UK is seen as being at the forefront of approaches to assessing the       performance of local government and the research has therefore also       attracted a high level of international interest.
Senior government       officials and local government managers from across the world, regularly       visit CBS to learn first-hand about the research.
Martin was invited to       speak about the research at the Swedish Local Authorities Research Network       Annual Conference at Lund University in 2008.
This international       perspective has been developed through a follow-on project funded by an       ESRC Knowledge Exchange Opportunities grant and aimed at the       cross-fertilisation of ideas between countries (2012-13).
A programme of       events engaged very senior policy makers from across the UK, other       European countries, North America, Asia and Australia, with three major       international conferences in London, Canada and Australia.
