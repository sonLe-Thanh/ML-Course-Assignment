     Context       In the early 1990s, when Miles first identified KIBS, innovation was       essentially considered to be the preserve of manufacturing firms focused       on technological product and process innovation (so called "TPP       Innovation").
Around this time, the concept for national (and later       sectoral and regional) "systems of innovation" was developed, which became       highly significant in innovation policy.
Systems of innovation highlighted       the importance of institutions, interactions and interdependencies for       innovation and economic development.
Miles and colleagues' work       highlighted the role of KIBS as important agents within systems of       innovation, both as innovators and as innovation catalysts.
Gradually,       innovation policy has shifted from a focus on technological innovation,       underpinned by R&amp;D, to a wider concept, embracing innovation in, and       through, services, including KIBS.
Pathways to Impact       Pathways to impact have been both direct and indirect, and here include:     - Undertaking commissioned research on behalf of policy-makers or       policy-making bodies.
For example, the original 1995 KIBS report was       sponsored by the European Commission.
Another relevant study involving       Miles as a co-author was the "Study on Industrial Policy and Services"       which reported in 2008.
- Acting as an expert advisor.
For example, whilst at Manchester Jeremy       Howells acted as an expert advisor to the OECD for their "Sectoral Case       Studies in Innovation: Knowledge Intensive Service Activities (KISA)"       study.
This reported in 2006.
- Inspiring others.
Many of Miles' studies were undertaken in       collaboration with Manchester colleagues (e.g., Howells, Tether and       Tomlinson) as well as with researchers in Europe.
This led to the       diffusion, exchange and development of ideas, adding weight to concepts,       and pathways to influence policy-makers within the European Commission,       OECD and national governments.
- Other research was undertaken in cooperation with "knowledge intensive       business services".
For example, Howells' paper on innovation       intermediaries derives from an ESRC funded project (L700377003) that was       undertaken in collaboration with two intermediaries &#8212; the Applied       Industrial Research Trading Organization (AIRTO) and CERAM.
- Key concepts and findings have been presented to and discussed with       policymakers.
Reach and Significance       Although slightly different terminology is sometimes used, the       significance of KIBS as innovators, and as influential actors in `systems       of innovation' is increasingly acknowledged by governments, the       international bodies, such as the OECD, and incorporated into policy.
UK Impact       Recently (September 2012), the UK government has introduced an industrial       strategy [I] framed around three key sectors, including `knowledge       intensive traded services'.
In keeping with a `systems of innovation'       approach, the policy emphasises both interdependencies amongst businesses       and other actors (such as universities) within sectors and emphasises the       critical role of innovation in driving competitiveness.
"Knowledge       intensive traded services" are specifically highlighted as being both a       source UK comparative advantage with considerable potential for further       growth, and as being a "large enabling sector ... underpinning growth         across a large part of the economy" (p.33).
These ideas are       fundamentally those outlined in the 1995 report by Miles and colleagues       and subsequently developed by Manchester researchers.
Further confirmation       of the impact on UK policy is provided in a statement from the Head of the       Services Policy Unit at BIS [B]: "In July of this year the Government         published "Growth is Our Business: A Strategy for Professional and         Business Services", the culmination of 6 years of effort to place KIBS         at the heart of industrial strategy.
The point I would make is that this         major shift in policy (and developments summarised above) was         underpinned by, and can be traced back to, the work of Ian Miles, and         specifically to Tether and Howells."
International Impact       Further afield, in the European Commission, a 2009 Commission Staff       Working Document (SEC(2009) 1195 final/2) [F], on the "Challenges for EU       support to innovation in services" states that: "KIBS firms play an         important role in national innovation systems, through original         innovations, [and] knowledge diffusion.
... KIBS are a driver of ...         services innovation and an essential element of regional and national         innovation systems."
(p. 20).
Also notable is that the Commission       included KIBS in its "Sectoral Innovation Watch" studies (2008-2010)       alongside the other eight strategically important sectors (e.g.,       automotive, biotechnology, electrical/optical equipment, and space and       aeronautics), and sponsored further research through its 6th       Framework Programme (See Schricke et al., 2012 [J]).
The EU's "European       Competitiveness Report 2011" [H] also provides an extensive discussion on       KIBS and their significance.
A statement from a Policy Officer within       Directorate General for Research and Innovation at the EC confirms [E]: "The         European Commission has enjoyed a long-standing, fruitful and         stimulating collaboration with Professor Ian Miles and his colleagues at         the University of Manchester, who we regard as experts in the field of         service innovation and, more specifically, as thought-leaders on the         role of `Knowledge Intensive Business Services' in systems of innovation         and economic development"     The OECD prefers a derivation of KIBS, "knowledge intensive service       activities" (KISA).
An initial study on KISA was undertaken by the OECD in       2006.
More recently a 2012 report by the OECD Working Group on Innovation       and Technology Policy has recognised that "in addition to being highly         innovative themselves, [KISA] facilitate the innovative capacity of         their clients" (p. 16), have "a crucial role to play in the innovation         ecosystem", and have a "crucial role as catalysts in economic       development" (p. 16).
A statement from an OECD secretariat member [C]       further confirms the significance of the Manchester work in development of       OECD strategies: "More recently, Ian Miles' influence could be seen in         the measurement work done as part of the OECD Innovation Strategy         published in 2010.
Now, however, I am observing, as a member of the OECD         Secretariat, the preparation of the 2015-2016 Programme of Work and         Budget and there the work of Professor Miles is shaping discourse on the         role of service industries, and innovation in these industries, as part         of understanding global value chains and also the planned work on the         impact of inclusive innovation."
Other national governments have also recognised KIBS strategic and       catalysing role (e.g., Norway, Sweden, Finland,).
In Finland, for example,       VTT, Finland's Technology Research Centre is tasked with developing       high-end technology solutions and innovation services, and a Research       Professor [A] there has stated: "Tekes is Finland's funding agency for         technology and innovation.
From 2006 to this year, Tekes has carried out         a big innovation programme called SERVE.
It is through this programme         that awareness of KIBS and their roles has increased substantially in         Finland.
New KIBS companies have been established and also procurement         of KIBS services within the public sector has increased.
Again, these         ideas have their roots in the early work of Ian Miles on KIBS."
Furthermore, recognising the growing significance of services as reported       by Miles' research, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research       introduced the "Innovation with Services" programme in 2008, aimed at       funding the systematic development of new services.
This programme has       since been renewed, and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research       will provide around &#8364; 70 million to it over the next five years.
The Head       of Department, Work Design and Services at the German Project Management       agency, working for the German Ministry of Education and Research confirms       the importance of Miles' work in this area [D] : "At the German Federal         Ministry of Education and Research our understanding of innovation in         services, and more specifically the role played by `knowledge intensive         (business) services' has been greatly aided by the research undertaken         by Professor Ian Miles and his colleagues at the University of         Manchester"     More generally, a United Nations report [G] (2011) has highlighted the       key roles of KIBS in economic development.
The research of Miles is cited       several times within the report and is noted as an "important         contribution" (p. 3) to the field.
