     Surrey's research has had numerous significant influences on the public       and policy understanding of sustainable growth and has influenced       corporate and policy response.
In considering the impact of the work we       focus below on a major public-facing output, the 2009 book Prosperity       without Growth (PwG)[4] which synthesises many of the findings of       the wider research programme.
Impacts on society, culture and creativity     Addressing the complex relationship between production, consumption,       technical innovation, economic growth and sustainable development, PwG has       become a touchstone for debates on economic crisis, recovery and the       transition to sustainability, both in the UK and worldwide.
Since the       financial crash of 2007-08, these issues have held wide appeal across a       huge range of constituencies, including poverty action groups,       environmental groups, financial sector organisations, business leaders,       religious groups and policy communities.
The Sustainable Development Commission report authored by Surrey         researchers "Redefining Prosperity" became the most downloaded         publication by the Commission: over 125,000 downloads from the SDC         website alone.
10 Downing St wrote "Your work...has done a great deal           to advance thinking in this area" [a];       PwG was a bestseller: reprinted within 6 weeks of publication;         translated into 17 languages (including Chinese) and sold over 50,000         copies;       it briefly occupied 4th place in the Amazon best-sellers list, after         Ed Miliband, Leader of the Opposition, was photographed taking the book         on holiday for `summer reading' [b]       Prof. Jackson's 2010 TEDtalk - based on PwG - has been viewed over a         million times worldwide and has subtitles in 26 languages [c].
Important to its influence, the work has received awards and highly       positive reviews:            three international prizes and nominated for more (Bild der         Wissenschaft, Knowledge Book of the Year; Association of Professional         Futurists, Most Significant Futures award 2012; Treehugger, Best of         Green: Business and Politics       it was named as one of the `best books of the year' by the         Financial Times       and was reviewed favourably by broadsheets around the world [d]         including the New York Times, Le Monde, La Vanguardia, and Die Zeit.
Le         Monde stated "PwG is one of the most outstanding pieces of           environmental economics literature in recent years" [d]       George Monbiot in the Guardian: "It's a revolutionary text...whose           time has come" [e]          The research has stimulated public discourse on growth and       sustainability.
The German Government initiated a wide-ranging inquiry into prosperity         and sustainability: The Enqu&#234;te Commission on Growth, Wellbeing and         Quality of Life.
A Member of the German Bundestag and Enqu&#234;te Commission         subcommittee Chair described PwG as `having had an enormous impact           here in Germany... highly influential in framing a lively debate about           economic growth in Germany...the best book on the issue' [f].
The         German translation has been reprinted three times, including a         government-sponsored popular edition, to make it accessible for         educational purposes.
The impact of PwG extends far beyond Western Europe: there are two         separate Chinese translations of the book.
In South America, Jackson         gave numerous talks, including one for the banking giant Santander, and         collaborated with local institutions in public discussions on the green         economy during the Rio+20 conference in Brazil in June 2012.
In Eastern         Europe, Jackson waived royalties to allow the Lithuanian government to         sponsor a book translation.
Impacts on public policy and services     The book has been read and commented on by leading politicians and       policymakers:            the former French President Nicolas Sarkozy drew attention while in         office to the significance of the work, describing it as a `brilliant           thesis' that makes a `substantial contribution to the           reflection on a reform of our economic system' [g];       in summer 2011 there was much media discussion of inclusion of PwG in         reading material for Ed Miliband, Labour Party leader and former         Secretary of State for Energy &amp; Climate [b]       the work is referred to in the Parliamentary Office of Science and         Technology's PostNote 408 "Seeking Sustainability", March 2012, supplied         to all Parliamentarians [h];          Prof. Jackson has given over 120 keynote lectures worldwide to audiences       of policymakers, academics, NGOs and business leaders on the issues       covered in the book and related research programme.
Documented evidence of       policy debate and impact on policy includes:            Prof. Jackson gave a keynote speech at the Prince of Wales' annual         Accounting for Sustainability conference in 2009, followed up by an         invitation-only meeting about the book hosted by Clarence House,         involving leading UK economists; an outcome was an initiative for an         integrated emissions reporting framework for companies, later presented         to the Rio+20 conference and formally accepted in the Rio Conference         output `The Future We Want'.
Prof. Jackson addressed the UN 64th General Assembly in New York on         the green economy; he was subsequently invited to contribute a         background paper for the UN Division on Economic and Social Affairs'         preparation for the Rio+20 conference.
`Green economy' was one of two         themes eventually chosen for the conference.
At Rio+20 Prof. Jackson delivered numerous speeches and seminars on         the green economy and engaged in a High-Level Dialogue hosted by the         King and Queen of Sweden and the UN panel on Global Sustainability.
The         meeting presented a declaration entitled `The future we choose' directly         to the Executive Director of Rio+20 as an input to the formal         negotiations.
RESOLVE was a research partner in the UN Environment Programme's         Global Survey on Sustainable Lifestyles (GSSL) and Prof Jackson gave a         keynote at its launch in New York in 2011.
The Framework was formally         adopted in the final Declaration of the Rio+20 conference: the         continuance of UNEP's programme on Sustainable Consumption and         Production was one of the very few concrete outcomes from the         conference.
In the UK, the research underpinned recommendations of the         Environmental Audit Committee's twelfth report (April 2012), on the         Green Economy [i].
Drawing directly on Prof Jackson's oral evidence,         they recommended that the Government should: set up a unit to examine         the relationship between growth, prosperity and quality of life (paras         54/56) and; make emissions reporting mandatory for the private sector,         as a key part of Government's approach to directing consumer demand to         more sustainable choices (paras 57/60/62).
Government has now acted on         this latter point, and from 1 October 2013 the Companies Act 2 will require UK quoted companies to report on their         greenhouse gas emissions.
Impacts on practitioners and professional services     The research has influenced businesses concerned with economic and       engineering challenges of transition to sustainable capitalism and       low-impact, high-value technological systems.
The Esmee Fairbairn Foundation sponsored a 9-month project at Surrey         to engage business leaders on integrating business models deriving from         PwG into corporate strategy       Prof Jackson engaged with numerous companies on the implications of         his work on prosperity and growth, including Shell, Santander, United         Utilities, BT, Kingfisher, Marks and Spencer, and Unilever.
The Global         Advocacy Director at Unilever says "(the) research...has produced           some of the most original and challenging thinking on sustainable           living", "(the work) is closely aligned with Unilever's           commitment to enhance well-being" [j].
The Head of Sustainable         Business at Marks &amp; Spencer says "The work of RESOLVE and SLRG           has broken new ground and established UK research leadership in the           social science of sustainability.
PwG has offered a narrative for           sustainability that resonates increasingly widely in the wake of the           financial crisis...this new reality is one that business is keen to           grapple with.
"[k]       Jackson was invited to sit on Advisory Boards relating to sustainable         investment by Aviva Investors and Alliance Trust; Jackson is also an         advisor for the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's Circular Economy initiative         which has raised over &#163;6 million in corporate sponsorship to work         directly with businesses on improving environmental performance       The Institution of Mechanical Engineers aims to help engineers work         towards sustainability.
They have proposed Tim Jackson's definition of         Prosperity as a metric for that, and invited him onto a panel to oversee         this process; IMechE have 100,000 members globally, with 10,000 members         specifically interested in sustainability, and the potential for impact         on engineering practice is substantial.
The Royal Society published a major report on the challenges of       population growth and consumption in 2012.
Prof Jackson was on the Working       Group, his research is widely cited, and he contributed the analysis of       carbon scenarios in the report.
