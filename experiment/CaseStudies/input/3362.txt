     The University of Nottingham's research into the high strain-rate       behaviour of composite metals has resulted in significant industry       engagement and adoption, economic benefits and &#8212; as already demonstrated       in a real-life setting &#8212; major improvements in safety.
This has resulted       in faster and cheaper development of the 168mm and 219mm diameter sized       street posts [4.1], which were formally launched in June 2010.
As of March       2013, 900 are installed in the UK and Ireland [4.2]     The University of Nottingham, through the involvement of Dr Brooks and Dr       Brown, has played a central role in the development of these two products,       providing numerical simulations of high strain rate behaviour that have       resulted in the specific material composition of the street posts.
Sales       of these two products account for 60% of the company's revenues and 50% of       the profits.
6 jobs have been created to produce, sell and install these       products [4.2].
Key outcomes resulting from the underpinning research include [4.2]:            Use of the pendulum testing methodology (the term used to describe the         virtual testing methodology, the development of which is described in         Section 2) to replace full vehicle crash testing.
Pendulum testing         alone: estimated cost savings of up to 70% per result.
Elapsed time         estimated savings of up to 83% per result.
Use of the design guide to replace full vehicle testing within         iterative product development.
Use of the design guide during product         development: estimated cost savings of up to 90% per result.
Elapsed         time estimated savings of up to 93% per result.
Use of the design guide and computer simulation to replace full         vehicle testing for product accreditation.
Use of the design guide &amp;         simulation for full product accreditation: estimated cost savings of up         to 72% per result.
Elapsed time estimated savings of up to 62% per         result.
Savings in bringing the products to market as a result of the modelling       work done by the University of Nottingham amount to approximately &#163;17k per       product through minimising the number of physical crash tests that had to       be performed and 2 months were saved in terms of the time to market.
In       the future this could increase to &#163;99.6k and 4 months saving if the       modelling fully replaces vehicular crash testing [4.2].
Figure 3: Picture of the real crash test simulated in Figure 2          Furthermore, the research provided valuable data that was used to secure       an investment of &#163;1.8m from Ahlstrom Capital (one of Finland's biggest       private equity investors, portfolio turnover exceeding &#8364;1Bn) to bring the       product to market [4.3].
In addition to the economic impacts, there has been at least one clear       example of the improvements in safety offered by these products: A vehicle       struck one post of a two post Frangible Safety Post installation and the       driver walked away unscathed.
It is likely that, should the vehicle have       struck a traditional steel post installation, the driver would have       suffered significant injuries [4.4].
FSP had their posts installed throughout the Shetland Islands in 2010 and       2011 [4.5] and commenting on this accident Neil Hutcheson, Roads Engineer       at Shetland Island Council said:     "We recently renewed a large number of advanced direction signs and         took the opportunity to replace the existing steel posts with the         passive safety equivalent supplied by FSP.
This incident has shown that         to be the correct decision.
I have no doubt that the vehicles occupant         would have been seriously injured if we had retained the steel posts.
We         consider that these passive safety posts can play a significant part in         reducing casualty rates and making Shetland's roads safer" [4.4].
On the 4th December 2012 in icy conditions there was an accident on the       A970 on the Shetland Islands.
A vehicle struck one post of a two post       Frangible Safety Post installation and the driver walked away unscathed.
It is likely that should the vehicle have struck a traditional steel post       installation the driver would have suffered significant injuries.
The       Frangible Safety Post that was struck performed and reacted exactly as       intended through our patented design.
