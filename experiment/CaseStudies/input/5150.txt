     The results of ICSS and the pooled meta-analysis, including data from       ICSS, have been incorporated into National Institute for Health and       Clinical Excellence (NICE), European, Australasian and North American       guidelines on the treatment of carotid stenosis.
They have also influenced       public debate and clinical practice.
1.
Changes to UK Guidelines: In 2006, the National       Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence IPG 191 on Carotid artery       stent placement for carotid stenosis, which stated "Long-term efficacy         in terms of prevention of stroke and restenosis is unknown" and       encouraged clinicians "to enter symptomatic patients into the ongoing         International Carotid Stenting Study".
In 2011, NICE updated this       guidance (IPG389) stating "Current evidence on the safety and efficacy         of carotid artery stent placement for symptomatic extracranial carotid         stenosis is adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that         normal arrangements are in place for clinical governance and audit or         research", quoting the published results of ICSS and our       meta-analysis in support of the conclusions [a].
In 2008, the 3rd edition of the National Clinical Guidelines       for Stroke, published by the Royal College of Physicians stated "Carotid         angioplasty or stenting should only be carried out in specialist centres         where outcomes of these techniques are routinely audited and preferably         as part of a randomised clinical trial."
In the 4th       edition published in 2012, this changed to read "Carotid endarterectomy         should be the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic carotid         stenosis, particularly those who are 70 years of age and over.
Carotid         angioplasty and stenting should be considered in patients meeting the         criteria for carotid endarterectomy but are considered unsuitable for         open surgery", quoting the results of ICSS [b].
2.
Changes to European Guidelines: The Karolinska Stroke       Consensus meetings form the platform for revision of the European Stroke       Organisation (ESO) Guidelines.
In 2008, the consensus statement concerning       carotid endarterectomy vs. angioplasty read: "Until the results of the         on-going trials are available for a pooled analysis of safety and         long-term effectiveness, stenting should not be routinely offered to         patients suitable for carotid endarterectomy."
In 2010, these were       changed to read "CEA is safer than CAS and remains the treatment of         choice for patients with symptomatic severe carotid stenosis who are fit         for surgery.
CAS is an acceptable option for initial therapy for         patients younger than 65-70 years with significant symptomatic carotid         stenosis in centres with a peri-procedural stroke or death rate similar         to that recommended for CEA", quoting the results of ICCS and our       meta-analysis [c].
3.
Changes to Australasian Guidelines: In 2011, the       Australasian Carotid Stenting Guidelines Committee updated its guidelines       stating "CAS should not be performed in the majority of patients         requiring carotid revascularization.
CAS may be considered for specific         high risk patients" citing ICSS, the ICSS-MRI sub-study and our       meta-analysis [d].
4.
Changes to North American guidelines: In 2011,       the Society of Vascular Surgeons in North American updated its guidelines       for management of extracranial carotid disease, stating "CAS should be         reserved for symptomatic patients with stenosis of 50% to 99% at high         risk for CEA for anatomic or medical reasons", citing the results of       ICSS [e].
5.
Impact on public policy debates: There has been       concern expressed in public debates about the uncontrolled expansion of       carotid stenting as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy in the face       of the trial evidence.
Several recent commentaries and leading articles in       prominent medical journals have cited our work [f-i].
For example,       a commentary in the Lancet by a leading expert neurologist entitled "Carotid         stenting: more risky than endarterectomy and often no better than         medical treatment alone" stated "This excess risk of stroke is         highlighted again in each of the three latest reports: the International         Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS), the ICSS imaging substudy, and the         Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stent Trial (CREST)"       [i].
6.
Impact on clinical practice: Individual units have       reported a fall in the number of patients treated by carotid stenting       after the results of ICSS were published in keeping with the data having a       direct impact on the practice of carotid revascularisation [j].
Within the English NHS, the numbers of patients treated by CAS did not       increase between 2006 and 2012, whereas the numbers of patients treated by       CEA increased by 30%, a finding consistent with a response to the findings       of our trials indicating that CEA was safer than CAS [k].
7.
Impact on patients: The training, proctoring and       supervision in CAS that we introduced as part of the CAVATAS and ICSS       trial protocols ensured that patients treated by CAS have the procedure       performed as safely as possible.
The perioperative risk of stroke or death       from CAS fell by 30% from 2001 to 2010 during the course of CAVATAS and       ICSS.
As a result of our research, patients can now be accurately informed       about the current risks of CAS versus CEA, and together with their doctor       can make informed choices about which treatment is the most suited to       them, resulting in better choice for patients, increased safety and       improved long-term outcomes.
