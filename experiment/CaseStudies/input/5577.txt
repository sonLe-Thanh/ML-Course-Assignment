     Impact beyond the academy was integral to this project from its       inception, as its very purpose was to open up public dialogue about       post-colonial narratives in institutionalised national remembrance.
It       sought to move between the biography of individual soldiers who       participated in colonial armies and the wider enclosure of war memory in       nationalistic and militaristic terms.
By inserting erased stories and       narratives into remembrance, it was intended to interrupt accepted forms       of war and memory with the noise of the past.
At a time when the discipline of sociology is looking for methods of       engagement with wider public audiences, Noise of the Past has set       an example for doing this that is new and innovative.
In the first       instance, participants collaborated in the project through the novel       technique of call-and-response, working across the media of poetry,       historical documents, music and visual art, and between different       specialisms and different generations in multi-lingual registers.
In the       second, through screenings and performances at numerous venues and events,       it incited and opened up a broader dialogue and imagination about war and       memory with numerous publics through sound, poetry, image and sensate       experience.
The premi&#232;re launch of `Unravelling' and `Post-colonial War Requiem' in       Coventry Cathedral, on 8 November 2008, was situated within the Coventry       Peace Festival.
[12] The event was opened by war reporter Martin       Bell (OBE, UNICEF ambassador) and compered by the renowned historian       Carolyn Steedman.
The audience of over 450 people was highly diverse and       included many people new to the Cathedral, including members of minority       groups, something which was commented on by the Cathedral organisation.
A       long-standing member of the Cathedral, who had as a child sung in       Britten's War Requiem in the Cathedral, said:     "I would just like to say how moving I found this evening [applause].
I have been here since the 1960's, for over forty years.
I have sung         Britten's War Requiem at least twenty times.
So I am extremely familiar         with that whole background and ethos and reconciliation work promoted by         the cathedral.
I think this is certainly the first time I have seen this interleaving         of the English Anglican tradition with the Indian traditions, from the         people who come to this city, been part of the colonial empire, fought         the war from an Indian background and then came to Coventry.
I thought         that was tremendously moving, to see that interleaving of the history         and experience of different communities.
I would just like to say that I         really do hope we can find ways to move that forward into the future."
The war historian Alessandro Portelli (Sapienza University, Rome) noted       the transformative and affective nature of the public production put       together by the Noise of the Past team:     "It was very moving...I thought the encounter between the local people         [in the cathedral] was very promising for the future...The presence of         the Grandfather...was very moving.
It was just perfect."
The audience constituted a cross-section of the population including       non-academics in influential positions in the cultural sector.
The Senior       Programme Manager of London' Royal Opera House in London said:     "The setting of course was fantastic...I am sure you have had a great         deal of very positive feedback from the many people who attended &#8212; thank         you for allowing me the opportunity to be part of it."
Sarah Shalgosky (Curator of the Mead Gallery at Warwick University) said:     "We really enjoyed the evening &#8212; ultimately, the breaks in electricity         provided a lovely moment to sit in the dark and reflect with the weight         of the building and Coventry's history above us.
The lighting of the         ruins behind strongly evoked John Piper's image of Coventry..."     The project has been commented upon widely in the South Asian Diaspora.
The affective qualities of the dialogue and the space it provides to deal       with tension have been recognised as transformative:     "Congratulations, it is absolutely brilliant...the filming the         music... the language, I don't know the words to describe it was so         heart wrenching ... the film was mesmerising..." (Jitey Samra, Black       &amp; Minority Ethnic Community Mental Health Development Worker).
Press and news coverage of the inaugural launch event was featured across       different media platforms.
[13] When Unravelling and the       Postcolonial War Requiem were presented again in November 2010       during the Coventry Peace Festival and part of the Coventry Cathedral       Blitz events, 500 members of the public were present.
[14]     The impact of the launch in the Cathedral was followed by further       national and international invitations.
It first moved to the Herbert Art       Gallery and Museum, located opposite the Cathedral, and later to the       Imperial War Museum, the V&amp;A, RIBA, the Southbank, and international       film festivals.
[15] Unravelling has circulated at       international arts events with audiences ranging from 50 - 200, such as,       the Re-Orient Festival, Stockholm (Oct 2008; audience size 200)       and international film festivals (e.g.
USA and Germany).
The film's       cultural impact has been acknowledged by being awarded two `best short       film' international awards: Sikh International Film Festival, USA,       (2009; audience size 100) and London Asian Film Festival, 2011 (audience       size: 80).
[16]     Unravelling has been included in significant conferences involving       third sector groups and cultural institutions, including galleries,       museums and festivals.
It was a central feature of the Black Screen         Heritage Conference (31 July 2009) organised by the Imperial War       Museum, in partnership with Yorkshire Film Archive and Skillset.
The event       influenced the strategy for creating accessible collections relating to       Black British heritage and knowledge sharing for wider communities.
The       pool of influence included black cultural organisations, archivists, film       curators, community arts workers and audience development managers.
Unravelling and Post-Colonial War Requiem formed a plenary       session on `Noise of the Past' in the Taking Part conference (29 -       30 Oct 2010), Southbank, London.
[17] This public event with       over 100 audience members stimulated the creation of new contexts for       debates in arts practice, and strengthened links between third sector       organisations and academic institutions.
A screening and panel discussion       was held at the V&amp;A conference `From the Margins to the Core' in 2010.
[18]       The audience consisted mainly of museum and gallery professionals.
In the       museum sector it is now becoming commonplace to display talking-head       testimonies on video and text boards.
Unravelling offers a more       challenging, sensory and creatively engaged method of presenting these       histories.
It informs its audiences, but also affects them emotionally.
The legacy of the project continues to be multi-pronged; impacting on the       academic field as well as broad publics located in established cultural       institutions as well as more informal grassroots organisations.
In the       ESRC Festival of Social Science in November 2013, Unravelling was       screened alongside a series of workshops with different voluntary and       community organisations across the UK.
[19] This included       ex-soldiers from the Commonwealth Countries, Asian Women's Groups, as well       as informal poetry societies.
