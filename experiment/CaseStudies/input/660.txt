     Creation of a new company     Oxford PV was spun out of the University of Oxford in December 2010 as a       direct result of Snaith's research.
The company was set up with an       exclusive licence to commercialise technology protected by 5 patents based       on [1], [2] and [3].
Snaith's research is the core driver for the company:       Oxford PV say "Oxford PV is a single product company and at this point         that product is entirely dependent on Dr. Snaith's research and         technology."
Snaith is Chief Scientific Officer for Oxford PV and a       further 6 patents from his research have been exclusively licensed to the       company since its establishment.
Oxford PV is based at Begbroke Science       Park, Oxford, and employs 11 staff [A].
Semiconductor solar cells dominate commercial photovoltaic markets, with       crystalline silicon (1st generation) and thin-film solar cell       technology (2nd generation).
Affordable global uptake of solar       energy requires a significant reduction in materials and manufacturing       costs and must therefore be based on abundant materials.
The high material       cost of crystalline silicon cells has resulted in the search for       alternative low cost solutions such as thin film solar cell technology.
However thin film solar cells that are currently available use scarce       elements in their construction, for example indium and tellurium.
Conventional liquid electrolytes are also volatile, corrosive and       difficult to seal and hence severely limit the overall performance and       feasibility.
Oxford PV has developed 3rd generation technology using       Snaith's research to make solar cells from cheap and abundant materials       that are fabricated using simple screen-printing techniques.
Replacing       liquid electrolytes with solid-state hole conductors improves the       performance.
The efficiency of lab-based cells is over 15% (world-leading       for its class) and the manufacturing costs are estimated at 30% of the       current lowest cost of thin film technologies.
Oxford PV targets the Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) sector and       its business model is to have their solar cells printed onto windows that       are integrated into office buildings.
US energy analyst Nanomarkets       forecasts revenues for BIPVs to rise to $16bn by 2017.
Investment and funding     In the difficult current investor climate, Oxford PV has received high       levels of investment and funding totalling over &#163;3.3m in 2.5 years,       demonstrating the viability of the company.
To our knowledge, other UK       solar spin-outs in the REF period have failed to raise substantial       external funds.
Investment into Oxford PV includes &#163;700k secured in June 2011 in their       first fundraising round.
Investors include MTI, Parkwalk, World Gold       Council and business angels.
&#163;30k was also invested by the University of       Oxford's University Challenge Seed Fund (UCSF).
David Ward, Managing       Partner and Head of Cleantech investing at MTI said: "We've been         analysing the Photovoltaics section for some considerable time.
OPV is         unusual in that it pairs world class science with a founder team that is         very focused on execution and growing the business in a pragmatic way         that gives the best chance of commercial success."
&#163;2.03m was raised in their second fundraising round in 2013.
Again this       was led by cleantech investment specialists MTI, who said: "We are         delighted with the technical and commercial progress of the business         since MTI supported OPV's spin out in 2011.
The company is addressing a         huge potential market opportunity and the building of the product         development facility is an important step on the road to full         commercialisation."
In addition to these investments, Oxford PV was awarded a &#163;250k       Technology Strategy Board (TSB) R&amp;D grant in 2012 and a &#163;211k grant       from the EU FP7 in 2013.
Recognition and prizes     In 2010, Oxford PV won the Disruptive Solutions for Energy, Digital       Healthcare and Sustainability Problems award from the TSB, beating 550 UK       companies.
In 2012, Oxford PV were winners of the TSB's competition-led       trade mission to San Francisco `Clean and Cool Mission' for twenty of the       UK's best, high-growth potential cleantech companies ready to do business       in the US and overseas.
Oxford PV was the winner of the 2013 Renewable       Energy Association's British Renewable Energy Award for innovation 2013       for "a technology with the potential to turn iconic glass buildings         into powerhouses, with no compromise to building performance."
In       2013, Oxford PV won the Best Early Stage Investment in a Disruptive       Technology Business Award at the UK Business Angels Association Awards,       sponsored by the TSB.
In 2013, Snaith won the TSB Solar Award for Research       "for his outstanding scientific work pushing up the efficiency of new         solid state solar cells and also his practical focus contributing to the         formation and funding of Oxford Photovoltaics Ltd."     Adoption of Oxford PV glass in building specifications     Oxford PV glass has been included in the specifications for new       buildings.
Decisions have been made by construction companies to use       Oxford PV technology and by architects to include Oxford PV technology in       their bids for contracts for new development projects.
