     Publication of the results of the ATAC trial, (five-year follow up in       2005, 10-year follow up in 2010), supported by results from other       international trials that confirmed our findings, led to a major change       worldwide in the treatment of women with postmenopausal oestrogen receptor       positive breast cancer.
This research [a] established beyond doubt the       most efficacious treatment for preventing recurrence; [b] quantified the       benefits; [c] documented and quantified the side effects; and [d] showed       how the major side effects can be most effectively managed in different       sub-groups of women.
The impact of these results can be observed in       policy/guidelines; clinical practice; and changes in morbidity and       mortality.
4a: Change in policy / guidelines     Three examples are given from numerous policies and guidelines around the       world:             UK: In 2009 the NICE guidance for treatment of women with         hormone receptor-positive breast cancer was changed to five years of an         aromatase inhibitor as the treatment of choice.
See [10,11] and BMJ         summary reference [12] below.
USA: By 2006, three leading professional organisations (the         National Comprehensive Cancer Network Breast Cancer Clinical Practice         Guidelines in Oncology, the American Society of Clinical Oncology         Technology Assessment on the Use of Aromatase Inhibitors, and the St         Gallen International Expert Consensus on the Primary Therapy of Early         Breast Cancer) had all changed their guidance to incorporate the results         of the ATAC trial.
However, at that stage the recommendation reflected         that no overall increase in survival had yet been shown, and anastrozole         was considered to be `equivalent' to tamoxifen [13].
In 2010, on         publication of the 10-year follow-up of ATAC (which did show a         statistically significant benefit on mortality), the ASCO task force         updated its guidelines [14], recommending that most postmenopausal women         with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer consider incorporating         aromatase inhibitor therapy in adjuvant treatment.
Australia: Government-issued guidance for treatment for         post-menopausal women with hormone receptor positive early breast cancer         favours anastrozole over tamoxifen [15].
4b: Change in clinical practice     Anastrozole is widely used throughout the world, with over 5.9 million       patient years of medication recorded [16].
For example:             UK: Standard clinical practice in every oncology unit in the UK         reflects NICE guidance, which incorporates the ATAC findings.
Depending         on clinical circumstances &#8212; eg the individual balance between risk of         endocrine side effects (commoner with tamoxifen) and bone side effects         (commoner with anastrozole) &#8212; anastrozole is now routinely offered to         post-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer [17].
USA: Health Maintenance Organisations in USA fund anastrozole         in suitable patients.
See for example [18].
Australia: Anastrozole is now approved (registered and         subsidised by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) for use in women with         hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.
More than a million Australian         women have received this treatment regimen.
Germany: A study of prescribing patterns among oncologists and         gynaecologists in Germany [19] concluded in 2008 that treatment with         aromatase inhibitors had increased dramatically and had effectively         replaced the previous gold standard treatment, tamoxifen.
4c: Change in morbidity and mortality (time to recurrence and side         effects)     Sine the 10-year follow-up of the ATAC trial was only published in 2010,       insufficient time has passed to follow up non-trial subjects long-term.
Over 10 years, around 80% of ATAC participants taking anastrozole were       still cancer free, compared with 76% of those on the previous gold       standard treatment of tamoxifen.
Anastrozole causes significantly fewer       side effects than tamoxifen, and is not associated with any increase in       endometrial cancer, other gynaecologic symptoms or thromboembolic events.
Extrapolating from the trial data, we anticipate that since around 32,000       postmenopausal women are diagnosed annually with breast cancer in the UK,       this is likely to translate to over a thousand fewer women developing a       recurrence of their breast cancer or experiencing unnecessary side effects       from their medication each year.
