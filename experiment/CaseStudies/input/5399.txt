     The above research, in particular the WMTSA book [5], has had widespread       impact in a variety of sectors, as is detailed below.
There have been four software implementations of the highly cited       (&gt;2000 citations, [A]) WMTSA book that have had widespread use:     (1) TIBCO Spotfire S+ Wavelets: This software was developed     primarily by Bill Constantine at Insightful (owners of S+).
It is based very     heavily on WMTSA.
This is acknowledged in [B]: "The new methodology     implemented in S+Wavelets 2.0 stems almost entirely from Don Percival's book     entitled, Wavelet Methods for Time Series Analysis, co-authored by Andrew     Walden and published by Cambridge University Press in 2001" [B].
Subsequently the S+ software was sold to TIBCO [C] and v8.1 incorporated       into their Spotfire system in 2008 (see under Powerful New Statistics)       [D].
The press release announcing the release of TIBCO Spotfire S+&#174;       version 8.1 states "Spotfire S+&#174; is the only statistical programming         platform that delivers a fully integrated development environment, a         commercially supported analytic packaging system, and the ability to         scale a desktop to manipulate gigabyte class data sets.
Spotfire S+         enables statisticians and business analysts to prototype, test, and         deploy analytics much faster than with alternative statistical modeling         environments.
It delivers a wider range of robust statistics tools, as         well as improved deployment and integration capabilities that help         business analysts and researchers make informed and reliable decisions         at critical points across the organization" [D].
Specifically the       Wavelets Package is described as providing "advanced signal and image         analysis, time series analysis, statistical signal estimation, and data         compression analysis" [E].
Spotfire customers span the Life       Sciences, Financial Services, Energy, Government, Consumer Goods,       Manufacturing and Telecommunications sectors [F].
Companies include GE,       Chevron, PerkinElmer Inc., GlaxoSmithKline, Cisco, the BNP Paribas,       Aberdeen Group, Salesforce, and BUCS Analytics.
65 US Government agencies       including the CIA, NSA, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)       and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) use Spotfire S+ [F].
(2) WMTSA: a MATLAB toolkit developed by Charlie Cornish       (Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington).This is       widely used in fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging).
For example,       it is used in the processing pipeline by the Brain Mapping Unit at       Cambridge [G] and its Neuroscience use is frequently acknowledged (e.g.,       three papers in 2010 and 2012 are given in [H]).
It is recommended       software (2010) used by the international company Disha Life Sciences Ltd       for Metabolomics (regulation and fluxes in cells) [p. 88 of I]).
(3) Waveslim: R package for "basic wavelet routines for time       series (1D), image (2D) and array (3D) analysis" [J] developed by Brandon       Whitcher.
The waveslim code is based in part "on wavelet methodology         developed in Percival and Walden (2000)..." [J].
This has been       extensively used with applications ranging from a Reserve Bank of New       Zealand document on measuring core inflation in New Zealand [K] to studies       of copy number alterations in breast cancer led by Fred Hutchinson Cancer       Research Centre [L].
(4) wmtsa: a package developed by Bill Constantine and Don       Percival in the R programming language [M].
As with the MATLAB       distribution, this software has also found use in fMRI (e.g.
[N]).
As a further specific example of the use of WMTSA in the biomedical       sector, in an email Dr. Brandon Whitcher (now Senior R Consultant, Mango       Solutions) confirms the use of methodology from WMTSA to analyse       univariate and bivariate time series in support of early-phase drug       development at GlaxoSmithKline during the period 2005-2009.
The       methodology was applied "in the quantitative analysis of both         functional and pharmacological MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)         experiments in a variety of pre-clinical models for the neurology and         psychiatry therapeutic areas.
It facilitated the rapid and efficient         processing of time series data, and produced easily interpretable         results to the imaging scientists that supported our internal         decision-making process."
[O]     Monitoring of Santa Maria del Fiore Dome in Florence     Based on the MODWPT algorithm introduced by Walden &amp; Contreras       Cristan, and included in WMTSA, Gabbanini, Vannucci et al [P] used wavelet       packet variances to analyse crack widths in the famous dome of the Santa       Maria del Fiore Cathedral in Florence.
Their analysis revealed "interesting         aspects regarding the dynamics of crack evolutions and the structural         functions of the different elements of the dome".
The influence of       this work is confirmed in the OPA Workshop on Monitoring of Great       Historical Structures (Florence, January 2012) discussion "60 Years       Results of the Monitoring System on Santa Maria del Fiore Dome in       Florence" by Blasi &amp; Ottoni which cites Gabbanini, Vannucci et al as       one of the "essential references for Santa Maria del Fiore monitoring       issue" [Q].
Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources     Methodology from WMTSA was used in the modelling of tree taper of jack       pine (Pinus banksiana) trees grown in the Canadian boreal forest region in       a study carried out by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources [R].
A       key point in their model fitting analysis is the use of reflecting       boundary conditions: "Following Percival and Walden (2000, p. 140)..."The       results of the study "opens new possibilities for analysing         longitudinal or taper data collected across time or space.""
Finance     Marco J. van der Burgt [S] of Atradius Group Risk Management (Amsterdam)       used the MODWT algorithm and wavelet variance results as given in WMTSA to       analyse monthly observed default rates to answer the question "how long         is a business cycle and where are we in the business cycle?"
This       enabled the inclusion of business cycle effects in default probability       validation.
