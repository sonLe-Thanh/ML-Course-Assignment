     From the outset, researchers formed a close link with the Basque Children       of `37 Association, which contributed its archive to the University       Library.
The collaboration culminated in May 2012 in a two-day event       commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Ni&#241;os'       arrival in Southampton.
Around 100 people attended the event, the       highlight of which was the launch of a book co-authored by Pozo-Guti&#233;rrez       and Broomfield, "Here, look after him": Voices of Basque Evacuee         Children of the Spanish Civil War.
The event provoked strong       reactions even in those who had no family ties to the Ni&#241;os.
One       member of the public commented: "To be able to listen and to speak to       people who had either been evacuees themselves or children of evacuees,       and through the films to understand something of what they had to go       through, was unforgettable".
Another attendee remarked on the gap in       public knowledge around the Spanish Civil War and the evacuation.
After       the event, Pozo-Guti&#233;rrez received a number of emails from       second-generation descendants of the Ni&#241;os, as well as students       and researchers who had been influenced or inspired by the project and       book [5.1].
Throughout the project, researchers gave talks to audiences of up to 40       at local community groups including Hampshire Archives and Southampton       Arts and Heritage, and impact was sustained through a space in       Southampton's new SeaCity Museum (visited by 140,000 people April 2012 &#8212;       April 2013 [5.2]).
Talks at international events, including a       UNESCO colloquium in Paris, extended the impact beyond the UK.
An       unexpected consequence of the colloquium showed how the research helped to       put the marginal voices of war children on the research agenda: when the       UNESCO Turkish delegation protested at the display of children's drawings       of the Armenian genocide, President Nicolas Sarkozy defied protestors to       announce that denial of the persecutions was to be an offence.
Researchers also participated in a travelling public exhibition, with       venues including the University of Zaragoza; University of Las Palmas de       Gran Canaria; Southampton Solent University; and Hampshire Records Office       [5.3].
In May 2012 an electronic version of the exhibition was made       available on the University Library's Special Collections webpage [5.4].
A user commented: "With Libya and now Syria suffering from civil war, the       project is hugely significant not just for the ni&#241;os and maestras       but also as a lesson for the future to us all" [5.5].
The project has inspired several documentary films, bringing the       experiences of the Basque children to wider and younger audiences and       enabling new generations to make relevant connections with contemporary       debates on immigration.
Directed by Matt Richards, To Say Goodbye       is an animated documentary film featuring voice recordings collected       during the research.
It was released at San Sebastian Film Festival in       September 2012 and has been shown in 16 towns and cities in Spain.
It has       been selected for four international film festivals, including the London       Spanish Film Festival, and has been nominated for two awards.
During the       making of the film a Facebook page acted as a platform to engage with a       second and third generation of descendants [5.6].
The forum proved       extremely popular and allowed members to participate in the May 2012       symposium via Skype.
Following the film's release Pozo-Guti&#233;rrez and       producer Izaskun Arandia were interviewed by the regional BBC news team.
Arandia said: "The [children] that returned by 1939 got more recognition       than those who didn't come back &#8212; now with this film they finally get that       recognition.
The interviews are the core, the backbone of the film.
If it       wasn't for Alicia's research there would be no film" [5.7].
Los         Ni&#241;os de Guernica tambi&#233;n tienen memoria, directed by Roberto       Men&#233;ndez, used footage from the Basque Children of `37 Association's 70th       anniversary celebrations.
It was released in 2008 and is available on       various online sites, such as Vimeo [5.8].
Further reach was achieved through the distribution of a DVD of material       gathered during the project.
The DVDs were launched in Refugee Week in       June 2010 and were distributed to secondary schools across the country and       made available to the local exile and refugee community.
The testimonies       collected as part of the research have also influenced modern languages       curricula at the Universities of Southampton, Leeds and Portsmouth through       their transformation into Open Educational Resources (OERs) thanks to the       JISC-funded project OpenLIVES: Learning Insights from the Voices of       &#201;migr&#233;s from Spain, now accessible through the University's digital       repository [5.9].
Extensive media coverage of the research by the local, national and       international press has substantially increased awareness of the plight of       the Basque refugee children and helped to establish connections between       past and contemporary refugees.
An article published by the Guardian       helped raise awareness of the research by including web links [5.10].
Articles in The Times, El Pa&#237;s, ABC and La Vanguardia also increased       awareness, as did television reports (BBC's The One Show, 28 July       2010, Canal + Informe Robinson, 30 September 2013), and radio       broadcasts locally (BBC Radio Solent) and internationally (BBC World       Service Weekend 30 September 2012, Radio Nacional de Espa&#241;a, RNE,       WRadio).
