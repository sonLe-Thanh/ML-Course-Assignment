     Impact on public policy       Eddleston's work has had a profound impact on WHO policies regarding world       pesticide-related       poisoning avoidance and treatment.
The pralidoxime study led the WHO to       exclude pralidoxime       from its Essential Drugs List in 2009; high-dose regimens of pralidoxime       are no longer       recommended [5.1, 5.2].
In addition, 2009 WHO guidance about how to       prevent deaths from       pesticide poisoning [5.3] was heavily based on Eddleston's work: all six       publications cited in its       summary were from the Eddleston group.
A 2008 WHO meeting led by Eddleston       resulted in       publication of guidance for triaging and treating patients with acute       pesticide poisoning [5.4].
The       WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) thereafter in 2008       integrated pesticide       poisoning into its assessment of patients [5.5].
In addition to the changes in WHO recommendations relating to       pralidoxime, Eddleston's work led       directly to national bans in Sri Lanka of fenthion, dimethoate and       paraquat (2008) [5.6].
These interventions, and particularly the three pesticide bans, have been       estimated to save 1000       lives per year in that country alone [5.7].
Impact on clinical practice and guidelines       Guidance concerning treatment of OP-poisoned patients has now changed       across Asia (for       example, 2010 national guidelines for Indian clinicians [5.8] demonstrate       by citation the importance       of Eddleston's work).
In summary, based on 250,000 deaths from pesticide self-poisoning across       Asia per year,       Eddleston and colleagues' findings on the use of atropine, pralidoxime and       charcoal, and the bans       of three toxic pesticides in Sri Lanka, are estimated to be saving       approximately 10,000 lives per       year on this continent.
