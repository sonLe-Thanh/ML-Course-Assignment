     Our research had impact as follows:     1) Cultural impact through the enhancement of individuals'       socio-cultural awareness and appreciation of film texts which have never       before been seen in public.
2) Impact on methods and practices: curators decide to use GIS as       a way of organising the Museum of Liverpool's catalogue spatially.
Our City in Film related projects established a wide range of       contacts nationally and internationally, with individuals and groups       including researchers, filmmakers, cultural producers, cultural       institutions and activist organisations, leading to:     (1) Cultural impact     The cultural impact of these projects on education for citizenship and       civic/community engagement with the city's environment is wide-ranging and       on-going.
Until 2008, rare historic films about the city were scattered       amongst a wide range of institutions and private collectors.
Many of these       films have since been donated for preservation.
Fifty of them are now       preserved in the National Film Archive, North West Film Archive and       digitised for permanent display as part of Screenonline and in the       `History Detectives' Gallery, new Museum of Liverpool.
Public screenings, exhibitions, lectures, seminars and events have made       this rich film heritage available to a wide range of audiences.
Screenings       have taken place at various Merseyside locations including Foundation for       Art and Creative Technology (FACT) media centre, Woolton Cinema, UCI Edge       Lane, Liverpool School of Architecture (LSA).
Public impact: response to the screenings has shown warm       enthusiasm: "a very useful service to the community and to historical         records", "brilliant glimpse into the past!"
"let's have more of         these events please", "films should be shown more often here!
", with       28 of 37 respondents rating a FACT event as excellent and a further 9 as       good (attendance 90).
Between September 2011 and January 2013, 907 people       watched NWFA screenings with City in Film content at events in       Liverpool, Sefton, Knowsley and Wirral.
Other screenings and events have       included large scale public events such Mitchell and Kenyon's         Liverpool Films' in their original Edwardian venue (full house, 800       people), 9 screening and discussion events from 2008-9 with contributions       from local filmmakers, artists and community activists, contributions to       the Waterfront Screening series (Tate Liverpool 2008), Terence       Davies Public Lecture, Liverpool University (2010, full house 250 people).
Public attendance at these screenings and events has ranged from 30-800       participants.
Participants ranged from predominantly young professionals       at FACT and LSA to mixed family audiences at UCI and elderly people at       Woolton.
Visits and requests for material on Liverpool and Merseyside from       personal researchers to programme producers, professional researchers and       educators have increased by 6-8% at North West Film Archive since 2008, a       rise that can be directly attributed to the change in the archive's       collecting policy in respect of material from Merseyside, the publicity       generated by the project (interviews for local, regional and national       television, radio and press included North West Tonight, GMTV,         ITV Granada, Radio Merseyside, Liverpool Daily Post and Echo; for       example, BBC         report, 2009) and increased public engagement through local       screenings and events.
Enquiries about developing this material for       educational use in schools have been received from local groups such as Lovehistory,       a Liverpool based education charity.
Institutional impact: City in Film, in partnership with       North West Film Archive, North West Vision and Media, Liverpool Libraries       and Liverpool Record Office, contributed to the development of a `place'       page featuring Liverpool for the British Film Institute's Screenonline       resource.
Some 45,518 visitors have viewed the Screenonline       Liverpool on Screen pages at March 2013, although this figure does not       account for links from associated works and biographies.
This `very       successful programme' received a special mention by the BFI as an       innovative model for a new on-line resource A Portrait of Britain,       in the BFI's memorandum to the House of Lords Select Committee on       Communications, in its inquiry into the British film and television       industries, 2009.
(see section 5:1)     Community impact: Heritage film is now part of the Museum's       education programme to stimulate engagement in citizenship and community       action.
In consultation with Hallam, Mark Bareham of Soap Box Films is       developing a lottery funded project with the Museum (as part of their       education programme) to run a series of workshops and create an on-line       archive of material made by Community Productions Group, a co-operative       media resource that documented co-operative business and voluntary schemes       in Merseyside in the 1980s.
A pilot screening and discussion of this       material announced in gallery attracted 30 adult participants of mixed       ages: average response to questions such as `how useful is material to       start a discussion' was 9.8, and `importance of making it readily       accessible' 9.9.
Comments included `Very relevant to today', `Scary and       relevant', `Really interesting and inspiring', `Good to relate today's       struggles to the past' (April 2012).
The project includes the development       of educational resource materials that will be piloted in community       settings as well as schools and colleges.
Hallam also provided consultation and support for Pidgin         Productions lottery awarded project `Back to         the Timepiece', a documentary that contributes to the history of       Liverpool's black community.
2) Impact on methods and practices     The Museum of Liverpool, opened in 2011, is the first purpose-built       museum in the UK for over 100 years.
According to its         web page it is now the most visited museum in the country outside       London.
Workshops, led by our researchers, introduced museum staff to the technological         and methodological insights and tools developed in the research         projects.
This has changed the ways curators at the Museum think about         accessing their collections.
The Museum's curators expressed an       interest in developing the public's access to their collections through       the use of an interactive map as part of discussions about the new Museum       of Liverpool's use of film in exhibition galleries.
Traditionally, the       public have had no means of accessing a museum's catalogue.
Geo-coding the catalogue and digitising images of many of the         artefacts relating to the Merseyside area and storing them in a GIS       system has enabled the public to access their local history by touching a       map on a screen in the History         Detectives Gallery.
A menu gives access to a wide range of material       including, but not limited to, film materials made available for public       display through collaboration between the researchers, amateur filmmakers,       North West Film Archive and the BFI.
The interactive map has been accessed by more than a million visitors         to the Museum.
(current footfall 1,188,226 since the gallery opened       in December 2011 against a target of 750,000).
The map is facilitating public participation in psycho-geographic         narratives of memory and identity around issues of place through       themed workshops e.g.
by the creation of `trails' which become part of the       map (c.f.
Radical City, Radical Women impact narrative).
Dr.
Rob Philpott, Head of Field Archaeology, commenting on participating       in the network, stated that "`The workshops have been intellectually very       stimulating...[they] created an enhanced awareness of developing       technologies in areas as diverse as GIS, GPS, mobile phone applications,       architectural reconstruction, music and film, and social history.
I       anticipate that the workshops will have a series of longer-term, perhaps       less immediate, benefits in the way the Museum of Liverpool team will       develop the displays on gallery'" (AHRC/BT network report Feb 2011).
Dr. Les Roberts is a consultant advisor on `City in Film' projects in         Bologna and Vienna.
This latter project proposes to use film to       examine how public space has changed over time using a similar approach to       City in Film.
A link to the report on their project, which       references their visit to Liverpool, is available in section 5:2.
