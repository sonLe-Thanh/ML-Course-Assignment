     The deterioration of concrete structures is of world-wide concern.
In the       UK, the total construction industry investment in 1995 was &#163;52 billion,       with 50% spent on maintenance, repair etc., representing a threefold       increase over the previous 14 years.
The &#163;28M Birmingham Midlands link       motorway required &#163;45M of repairs between 1972-89 and then required a       further &#163;120 million investment up to 2004.
In continental Europe,       structural repairs cost &#8364;1.4 billion p.a.
In 1998, US estimated a       five-year investment of $1.3 trillion to reinstate roads, bridges and       other infrastructure systems to good serviceable life.
This had increased,       by 2005, to $1.6 trillion, as in excess of 40% of 500,000 highway bridges       are rated as structurally deficient requiring $100 billion to eliminate       the bridge backlog.
The ERPE work on Non Destructive Testing (NDT) has been accepted       internationally by the American Concrete Institute (ACI 228-2r-2013), and       by international manufacturers such as Sensors and Software who use GPR       max software to design their new generation of GPR antennas.
This has       brought new insights into electromagnetic wave impulse radar GPR       propagation through concrete by linking antenna centre frequency in air to       wave propagation through concrete.
It has clarified the relationship       between antenna centre frequency and shallowest detectable target.
This       has heavily influenced Section 3.8 of ACI 228.2r-2013 and the data forms       the basis of associated Table 3.8.2.
The work on stress wave propagation       has brought new insights into impact echo testing of concrete.
Previously       the choice of impact hammer excitation of concrete was fairly arbitrary &#8212;       this work has related hammer size to signal wavelength and depth of first       detectable target.
ERPE research has changed industry thinking by heavily       influencing Section 3.2 of ACI 228.2r-2013 and our data forms the basis of       Table 3.2.3.2.
"As Principal and Manager of our international group NDT practice in         Dynasty Group I can verify that the ERPE work led by Forde has         established new understandings of the accuracy and effectiveness of NDT         techniques such as radar testing of concrete, masonry and railway         trackbed, plus impact echo testing.
This highly innovative world leading         work has influenced the technical success of our own company and has         achieved international impact through its inclusion in the American         Concrete Institute's ACI 228.2r-2013 "Report on Nondestructive         Test Methods for Evaluation of Concrete in Structures".
Forde led the         drafting of this world standard in Civil Engineering concrete NDT over 8         years and I was a voting member of the ACI 228 Committee."

The ERPE work led by McCarter developed the use of electrical property       measurements to study the hydration and hydration kinetics of cementitious       materials and the response of the concrete cover-zone to cyclic wetting       and drying key areas when assessing concrete corrosion.
The field       implementation of this work of this was implemented by McCarter when he       developed a corrosion monitoring [4] instrument: UK Patent application       WO2011 048378 A2 which was licensed in 2013 to Amphora NDT Ltd (sold under       the trade name Septopod:       http://www.amphorandt.com/septopod.html)       and has recently been installed on the Hangzhou Bay Bridge in China [S5].
"I can confirm that the long-term leading research on the performance         of concrete in extreme marine environments is of major importance to the         international bridge community.
This work, partially funded by us for         20+ years has led to a patent pending NDT instrument manufactured and         marketed by Amphora NDT, with sales in China.
Further development of the         sensor array &amp; retrofitting in a variety of Trunk Road environments         has expanded the applicability of the technology &amp; provides         confidence of ongoing structural performance.
This is an excellent         example of research fulfilling the needs of bridge owners and providing         an instrument to monitor important on-site durability issues worldwide"       &#8212; Network Bridges Manager, Transport Scotland [S2].
The ERPE radar (GPR) modelling work [6] over 10 years led Giannopoulos to       write the world's most widely used Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD)       forward modelling program (some 4,000 downloads) which has had a worldwide       impact on improving both the accuracy of interpretation of radar surveys       by service providers and also on the manufacturers design of antenna       systems:     "As CEO of Sensors &amp; Software, the world's leading manufacturer of         GPR (ground penetrating radar) equipment, I can confirm that the world's         leading GPR modelling software is GprMax which is used by industry and         researchers worldwide.
Here we use it for modelling to help us improve         our antennae for the worldwide market and we confidently state that it         is increasing our turnover and profit."

Concrete design research in ERPE, has made a significant contribution to       the fib (f&#233;d&#233;ration internationale du b&#233;ton) Model Code (MC2010), (fib       2013) [Ernst &amp; Sohn, Berlin, Oct 2013, ISBN: 978-3-433-03061-5 and http://www.fib-international.org/model-code-2010-final-draft-volume-1]       Cairns, as convenor of Task Group 4.5 (TG4.5) `Bond Models', was       responsible for drafting Section 6.1 `Bond of embedded reinforcement' and       sub-sections 7.13.2.5-6 within `Detailing'.
The previous version of this       fib Model Code formed the basis for Eurocode 2 (http://www.concretecentre.com/codes__standards/eurocodes/eurocode_2.aspx),       the design standard for Europe.
These Model Codes provide industry rules       which assist them today in the design of safe, constructible and economic       concrete structures.
ERPE innovations include:            Modified design rules to cater for: (a) new high performance concrete         (C100/125); (b) new materials and technologies with differing bond and         anchorage capabilities &#8212; e.g.
fusion bonded epoxy coated reinforcement         and headed bars.
Guidance has been introduced on the load carrying capacity of concrete         structures following a period of deterioration or following repair.
Inconsistencies in MC90 design rules have been addressed, e.g.
statistical analysis has demonstrated an insignificant difference in         bond strength between lapped joints and of anchorages, but design rules         in MC90 treat laps and anchorages as different.
MC2010 has resolved         these issues.
"As a colleague on fib Task Group 4.5 (TG4.5) `Bond Models' code of         practice I confirm that Cairns has been responsible for a major review         and updating the technical content covering the bond between embedded         reinforcement and concrete and that those revisions now provide a more         rational evidence based approach.
He is also leading production of a fib         Bulletin which records the rationale and evidence for these revisions         which will be published in 2014."
