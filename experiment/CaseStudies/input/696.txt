     Through a variety of events listed below, groups of students, as well as       teachers and actors involved in delivering theatre-based events for       schools, have been provided with up-to-date knowledge and fresh       perspectives on established themes in GCSE and A/AS-level history.
This       has challenged some of their preconceived ideas about Weimar and Nazi       Germany.
It has also given them insights into what historical research is       today, how and why it produces new knowledge, and the processes by which       that new knowledge is turned into new interpretations of the past.
In       other words, it has furthered their comprehension of history as an       academic discipline as well as their understanding of `Germany' as a       topic.
Since 2008 Stibbe has expanded his impact activities from local to       regional to national reach, incorporating insights from his new research       and publications.
This upward trajectory of impact can be traced in the       following list of beneficiaries.
1.
A-level students at Barnsley Sixth Form College       The impact here built on contacts established by Stibbe over a six-year       period (2004-2010) when he held annual sixth-form master classes at       Sheffield Hallam University on women in Nazi Germany as part of the       government's Aim Higher initiative.
In March 2012 and February 2013 master       classes with new content were delivered to c.35 A-level students from       Barnsley Sixth Form College.
They comprised a lecture and seminar on the       theme of the legacy of World War I for Weimar Germany.
The class involved       use of primary sources from Stibbe's research on gender and the       reintegration of former POWs (References 1-2), including the       above-mentioned speech in 1922 by Elsa Br&#228;ndstr&#246;m (see section 3), in       order to provide new ways of thinking about the divided memory of the war       in the 1920s and early 1930s.
Interviewed by one of the education       specialists at Sheffield Hallam University on 11 March 2013, the lead       history teacher at Barnsley Sixth Form College stated that the master       classes had given her `more confidence in teaching the subject' and       had helped her and her students to see the link between original research       into specific areas such as returning POWs and the development of new       interpretations of Weimar Germany more generally (Source 1).
2.
A-level teachers at the National History Teachers' Conference,         Keele       A lecture and follow-up question-and-answer session on recent developments       in historiography on Nazi Germany were delivered to two separate groups of       A-level teachers (around 25 in each group) as part of a conference       organised by Tristram Hunt MP in conjunction with Keele University in       November 2012.
They provided Stibbe with the opportunity to showcase new       themes based on Reference 4, particularly with regard to gendered       approaches to National Socialism.
The lead organiser of the conference       wrote to Stibbe afterwards thanking him for his contribution and adding: `Your         sessions on the Nazis were well received with 84% of the delegates in         the morning and 87% of the delegates in the afternoon stating that it         was valuable or very valuable' (Source 2).
One teacher commented in       direct written feedback to Stibbe: `I appreciate the historiography you         provided.
You have re-engaged me with the subject'.

Sixth-form students and their teachers       Publication of Stibbe's article `The Legacy of the First World War for the       Weimar Republic', in the sixth-form magazine New Perspective, 18/2       (December 2012), pp.
13-16.
This piece draws on References 1 and 3 in       order to demonstrate how the under-explored theme of returning POWs can be       used to provide a more multi-dimensional understanding of the impact of       the war, thereby encouraging students to move beyond a narrow focus on the       supposed `injustices' of the Treaty of Versailles in their coursework and       exam answers.
According to an email from the magazine's editor: `Most         purchasers are in the UK and are schools and colleges that teach AS- and         A-Level'.
It is especially suited to the sixth-form style of       teaching (Source 3).
There are purchasers from all continents, excluding       South America.
The journal is available in print and by electronic       edition, online at www.ehistory.org.uk').

A- and AS- level students from the North-West and Yorkshire regions       Using material from Reference 4, a lecture was delivered to around 180 A-       and AS-level students at Manchester Central Hall in December 2012 on the       theme: `Were women as well as men included in the Nazi `national       community?'.
The lecture drew on examples of `militarised comradeship'       between the sexes as a way of challenging the idea that war in the Third       Reich was necessarily imagined and experienced in fundamentally separate       ways by men and women.
This event was organised by Sovereign Education.
Of       the 90 students surveyed, 76% agreed or strongly agreed with the       statement: `this lecture has shown me that an understanding of gender       history can help challenge existing interpretations of the past' (Source       6).

GCSE students, school teachers and examiners, and professional         actors       In March 2013 Stibbe made a major contribution to Germany Live!, a       national conference-come- theatre show in the Adelphi Theatre, London put       on by Keynote Educational Ltd., one of the leading providers of training       courses for teachers and conferences for students.
This event was attended       by 1,350 GCSE students and 125 teachers representing 43 schools from       England including London, Kent, Surrey, Berkshire, Hampshire,       Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire,       Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Warwickshire, the West Midlands,       Hereford, Torquay and Carlisle (Source 8).
The event covered German       history in the period 1918 to 1945.
Prior to the show, Stibbe took part in       ten hours of rehearsals, helping to advise actors, narrators and GCSE       examiners on particular scenes as well as refining his own visual and       written material (Source 4).
On the day of the show, Stibbe had walk-on       parts in Acts I, III and IV, delivering detailed explanations of the       legacy of the First World War for Weimar Germany (References 1 and 3);       mass organisations in the Third Reich (Reference 4); and the role of women       in Nazi Germany (Reference 4).
These spoken sessions were combined with       information packs, visual material and imaginative scenes created by the       actors.
The show was captured on a DVD made courtesy of Keynote       Educational Ltd. Of the 87 students surveyed, 69% agreed or strongly       agreed that `the event has given me a greater understanding of the role of       women in Nazi Germany', while 54% agreed or strongly agreed with the       statement: `This event has given me greater understanding of how ex-POWs       were treated in post-war German society'.
One student commented: `The         role plays were very entertaining and I think the [information] pack         will be useful for me' (Source 7).
The chief narrator of the show,       himself an experienced history education consultant, wrote in a       testimonial afterwards that `Professor Stibbe's sessions... were         well-judged, thorough and appropriate for the age group... Stibbe         committed himself fully to the whole venture, discussing with and making         suggestions for the contributions of the other participants in a         collaborative way' (Source 5).
He also continued: `At the same         time as the "Germany Live" event was being prepared I was in the latter         stages of writing an A Level textbook... [for a] leading history         education publisher.
Professor Stibbe's contributions to the development         of "Germany Live" enabled me to improve the approach I was taking,         particularly in the chapter on the Volksgemeinschaft.
Professor         Stibbe also made available to me the article "In and Beyond the Racial         State" [Reference 4] which was particularly useful' (Source       5).
