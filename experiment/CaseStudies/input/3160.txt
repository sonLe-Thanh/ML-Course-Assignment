     Cooke's Britten research has benefitted public understanding, musical       organisations and creative practice.
Indicative impacts are described here       according to category of beneficiary:     (a) Music-lovers and concertgoers: Cooke's research has       transformed the understanding of a large general audience of music-lovers       through the media of public talks, notes for programme booklets, book       sales, and CD liner notes (discussed in section b).
Between 2008 and 2013       Cooke has given public talks on Britten at venues including LSO St       Luke's in London, the Royal Opera in Copenhagen, the Royal Northern       College of Music, and Wigmore Hall.
The first of these events is       indicative of the relationship between Cooke's original research and these       engagement activities.
It involved sharing new archival findings on       Britten's creative and personal relationships with first performers of his       works (especially the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich and soprano Galina       Vishnevskaya), to illuminate a discussion and subsequent live performances       of Britten's Cello Sonata and War Requiem.
Unsolicited       correspondence from audience members testifies to `such an interesting and       enjoyable lecture.
An inspiring and evocative account of all the events       surrounding the War Requiem', and 'Wonderful day yesterday &#8212; thank you &#8212;       so illuminating' (source 1).
In the same period Cooke has provided articles         and notes on Britten for the programme booklets of leading European       opera houses (ROH, ENO, Opera North, La Monnaie (Brussels) and Bilbao),       festivals at Aldeburgh, Cheltenham, Edinburgh and Krakow, and concerts at       Brighton Dome, Carnegie Hall, Royal Festival Hall (Philharmonia       Orchestra), and Wigmore Hall.
These contributions, while serving an       introductory function for non-specialists, are also regularly illuminated       by new insights: for instance, notes on the opera Death in Venice       for Aldeburgh Festival and Opera North draw original comparisons between       the principal character Aschenbach's attraction to an `eastern' soundworld       in the context of the score's serial elements, and the composer's own       creative block in the mid-1950s which he solved by borrowing from the       music of the gamelan.
The public reach of the Britten letters edition (outputs 4 to 6)       is evidenced by numerous press reviews in non-specialist publications (see       e.g.
The Telegraph 5.7.08 and 26.12.10, The Spectator,       14.6.08, The Economist 9.12.10, Wall Street Journal       18.1.13, The Spectator 9.2.13) (source 2), and by sales figures       which substantially outpace most musicological titles (to end July 2013:       vol.
4: 1,115; vol.
5: 841; vol.
6: 812; source 3).
Volume 6 of the       edition was the subject of an item on BBC Radio 3's Music Matters       (24 November 2012), whose presenter Tom Service found the letters       `extremely revealing' and commended the `astonishing detail' of the       editors' notes (source 4).
Since 2008, Cooke's other Britten         publications (outputs 2 and 3) aimed at general audiences have also       continued to sell well (cumulative sales figures to end July 2013 are War         Requiem: 3904; Cambridge Companion to Britten: 3731; source       5).
Further public engagement is achieved through Cooke's CD liner         notes (see section 4b), which have recently included a cover CD of       Britten's War Requiem for the BBC Music Magazine (ABC       circulation figures of 41,226 for 2012).
(b) Recording companies: Since 2010 Cooke has written liner         notes for twelve Britten CDs, including nine on the       internationally-distributed Hyperion and Chandos labels.
The Chandos notes       are downloadable at www.chandos.net       and www.theclassicalshop.net       (our request for CD sales figures or web-page hit data was declined).
The       notes provide an opportunity for the findings of Cooke's original research       to be shared with the CD-buying public, as in the case of Hyperion's       Gramophone Award-winning CD of Britten's songs for baritone and piano,       which relates the previously unknown circumstances of composition of the       lesser-known songs.
As well as benefitting music lovers, this activity       directly benefits the reputation of independent record labels like Chandos       and Hyperion for being closely informed by cutting-edge scholarship (on       its website Chandos describes its mission as `groundbreaking') (source 6).
The Literary Editor for Chandos (who commissions all CD liner notes),       writes that Cooke `is our first choice for consideration' for Britten       releases, because `he writes with unusual care and elegance, and is able       to concentrate an extraordinary amount of information within the       relatively limited space available in our booklets'; he adds that `one       always comes away from reading his notes with a thrilling sense of having       absorbed a huge amount of fresh knowledge, and then turn eagerly to the       music' (source 7).
CD reviewers frequently cite Cooke's notes approvingly,       adding lustre to the releases: see, for instance, International Record         Review (March 2011, `Notes are by the Britten authority Mervyn       Cooke'), American Record Guide (July/August 2011, `As Mervyn       Cooke's liner notes point out ...'), Fanfare (Sept/Oct 2011, `the       clear and sensible notes of Mervyn Cooke') (source 8).
(c) Performance organisations: Cooke's engagement activities       benefit the educational and outreach remit of performance venues, music       festivals and performing groups &#8212; a remit upon which these organisations'       public subsidy is often dependent.
Indicative are Cooke's contributions to       a 2011 London Symphony Orchestra Discovery Day &#8212; events marketed by the       orchestra under `Lifelong Learning' &#8212; which included two illustrated       lectures on the War Requiem and the Cello Sonata, and a panel       discussion on the Sonata with the two performers (source 9).
The event       served to bring together Cooke's research findings, a substantial public       audience of interested concert-goers and amateur musicians, and players       from the UK's most prestigious orchestra.
In 2013 Cooke introduced an       afternoon film screening of Night Mail (music by Britten) at       Wigmore Hall, to an audience of c. 65, in advance of a concert performance       of Britten's radio and film music by the Nash Ensemble.
(d) Performers: Cooke's research has broadened the Britten       repertory, furnishing conductors, orchestras and singers with attractive       and highly marketable new repertoire.
The suite drawn by Cooke and       Mitchell from the full-length ballet The Prince of the Pagodas has       stimulated new public interest in one of the composer's most neglected       major works, which was hitherto an impractical proposition for the concert       hall.
Since 2008 the suite has been performed eight times, by three       internationally renowned orchestras and conductors (LSO, Tilson Thomas;       Hall&#233;, Elder; Spanish National Orchestra, Slatkin), with four more       performances scheduled for 2014 in San Francisco (SFSO, Tilson Thomas)       (source 10).
Audience figures from the LSO performance, which sold out the       Barbican Hall (1,884 tickets; source 11), indicate the commercial       attractiveness of this music.
The Guardian review of this       performance noted that `Britten's 1957 ballet, given in the concert suite       prepared in 1997 by Donald Mitchell and Mervyn Cooke, ... is a gift for       Tilson Thomas, whose conducting tingled with excitement from start to       finish' (12.6.13); and a review of Elder's performances asked       enthusiastically for `a repeat performance of this suite by [other]       concert orchestras' (bachtrack.com review, 4.2.13) (source 12).
The conference `Benjamin Britten on Stage and Screen' at Nottingham in       July 2013 saw a rare performance and subsequent premiere commercial       recording of another neglected Britten work, his incidental music to The         Ascent of F6.
This work from 1937 was revived by Cooke and student       performers at the Aldeburgh Festival in 1996, and his advocacy has now       brought the participation of two leading professional singers (Jean Rigby       and Andrew Kennedy), the Ex Cathedra choir under their conductor Jeffrey       Skidmore, and NMC Records.
As part of this project, Cooke also oversaw and       performed in the premiere recording of the incidental music to On the         Frontier (1938) for inclusion on NMC's commercial CD release (source       13), which will further their pioneering commitment to releasing hitherto       unrecorded Britten works; and the performers have gained valuable       employment and exposure in the process.
The conference also included a       performance of The Golden Vanity by the choir of Loughborough       Grammar School.
(e) Other creative output: The letters edition is widely       acknowledged as an essential source for popular biographies of Britten, of       which there has been a small explosion in recent years.
For instance, in       his Britten's Children (2006), John Bridcut states `I should       acknowledge the central importance of the first three selections of       Britten's letters' (p. xii); Paul Kildea's recent highly-publicised Benjamin         Britten (2013) similarly states `This book could not have been       written without the groundbreaking Britten letters project' (p. xv), and       specifically mentions the pre-publication access given to the final       volumes in the series.
