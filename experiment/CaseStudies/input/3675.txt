     Contributing to commercial successes: Since its formation the       group has been consulted by over 50 external organisations in the UK and       overseas.
Following the evaluation of VR potential and its uptake       internationally in construction (Reference 1) the group began to       engage with developers to maximise the potential of projects.
An example       is The Stephenson Quarter, a `key regeneration project in the       heart of Newcastle'.
The developer Silverlink Holdings Ltd. engaged the       unit's Virtual Reality and Visualisation Group to create a virtual model       of the scheme, since: " it has strategic links with Central Station,         the historic core and the stylish Quayside -it was absolutely vital that         we were able to demonstrate connectivity to these key areas and to         communicate that message to different audiences."
Following the       work, the Director of Silverlink Properties reported that: "The project         through Northumbria University not only delivered that objective, it         provided a platform for many other uses from design development and         improvement through to promotion and marketing."

Aiding council's planning processes: Our most significant route to       impact came from the formation of Virtual NewcastleGateshead (VNG)       Partnership and the creation of the VNG City Model (both in 2009).
In       doing so, a great deal of research was conducted into the optimum       organisational structure of VNG (Reference 2) and attention paid to       ensure its sustainability (Reference 3 ).
The model now covers over       100km2 and compared with established practices, represents an effective       stakeholder communication tool and an efficient way of examining the wider       implications of planning applications.
As a result, it has shaped and       improved the planning processes of both councils.
For example, the       methodology of view impact assessment available with the       VNG model has been adopted by the two municipalities, and has played a       critical role in harmonising the planning processes of both.
As a result,       explicit recommendations for use of VNG have been included in Gateshead       and Newcastle Councils' Urban Design Supplementary Planning Documents.
To quote from the NewcastleGateshead Urban Core Area Action Plan (2011):       "(VNG) has been established to provide developers with the opportunity         for an accurate and effective view impact analysis to be undertaken of         new development set within the context of the Urban Core and its views.
Both Councils recognise this methodology of view impact assessment as         being of sufficient accuracy for planning application purposes".
(Source         2 ).
Improved decision-making for the built environment: The ideal       requirements of a virtual city model for enhancing the delivery the public       service of planning and regulating the built environment were established       at the outset (Reference 2 ).
In a report produced by Gateshead       Council (2011) its Urban Design Officer stated that VNG has provided: "developers         and architects with services which enabled their proposals to be more         accurately and efficiently developed and assessed within their urban         context".
The report continues that benefits include much greater       accuracy and efficiency for all those involved in planning       decision-making, by way of greater certainty, quicker decisions, and       resultant significant time and cost savings.
Benefits exist for: " all         stakeholders, including developers, architects, planning authorities and         their elected members, statutory consultees, marketing agents, potential         occupiers, and the wider general public" (all citations from Source         3).
Supporting professional practice through 3-Dimensional modelling and         Visualisation: VNG has supported 12 major urban development projects       (and many smaller schemes) by: " assisting architects and visualizers         to produce accurate imagery to help their clients, stakeholders and         other interested parties progress a project through the design         development and planning process."
(Source 4) The model has       been systematically introduced to over 30 client organisations and over 50       architectural practices via strategic partnerships with RIBA and       Northern Architecture, and has informed the design of Gateshead's most       significant recent projects, including Trinity Square and       Gateshead's quayside developments.
Ideally, city models should permit integration with applications that       assist decision-makers in understanding the performance characteristics,       as well as visual aspects of urban spaces.
Our work is concerned with       understanding how best to increase user engagement and develop VNG to       support multi-system modelling, with applications such as transport,       energy, pedestrian and heritage visualisations (Reference 3).
An       example is the Gateshead Boulevard project, where the Principal Engineer       (Transportation) of AECOM cites: "three major benefits" that the       VNG model brought to the project, namely (i) interoperability with: "multiple         software packages (which) allowed us to visualise and fit our proposals         in three dimensions"; (ii) its use with tools simulating: "the         movement of vehicles ...( and)... the impact of vehicle queuing on the         street scene"; and (iii) as" "an essential part of our         consultation exercises with Gateshead Council members&#8212;such that funding         could be secured for further design" (Source 5).
The       developers of the &#163;150 million Trinity Square project recognised that the       VNH model: "provided the architects with the benefits of an         established and recognised tool"...and..."allowed us to address         the Local Authority's requirements of the impact of the development ...         and how the development would appear ties into the existing urban fabric         as part of a regenerated town centre" (Source 6).
Generating cost efficiencies: Using the VNG model as an       experimental and developmental tool, Giddings et al.
have produced       a methodology for the dynamic three-dimensional design of public spaces       and city centre squares (Reference 4) that was adopted by five       practices (including Jane Darbyshire and David Kendall; and Napper       Architects) in a RIBA North competition to design a new major square for       Newcastle upon Tyne.
Professors Agnew and Dalton have adopted VNG for       their research fields of (respectively) Subway and City Climatology       and Agent-based Modelling.
Subway climatology research (Reference         5) has informed our work with Nexus (operators of the Tyne and Wear       Metro system) which combines airflow measurement with laser scanning to       visualise air flows and produce a predictive and diagnostic design tool       for underground transport systems.
To quote the Plant Engineering       Technical Manager of Nexus, the work: " is very important in assisting         Nexus to make some critical business decisions... it is planned to spend         approximately &#163;1.6 million on replacing 6-off ventilation fans...(and)...preliminary         work (by Agnew) has shown that ...(they)...are likely not         needed.
In addition to the capital investment...(this)...will         save an estimated &#163;110,000 per year in energy costs and reduce Nexus'         carbon footprint by 630 tonnes of CO2 per year" (Source 7).
Dalton's work has explored virtual environments as a method for       researching human factors in human understanding of, and interaction with       the built environment including the creation of a virtual e-mobility route       linking UK with other North Sea Region countries (Reference 6).
Contributing to art and culture: The artistic and cultural       contributions of the VRV Group include laser scanning of historic       structures (including the Lateran `Scavi' international collaboration,       Rome; Durham Castle; the `Black Middens' project for Tarset Archive Group,       and the Durham World Heritage Site Visitor Centre physical model of Durham       peninsula).
Exhibitions based on the work of the Group, and the VNG model       have taken place at Gateshead Hilton CBI event (2010) and the model has       supported an exhibition by landscape artist Colin Booth at the Laing Art       Gallery, Newcastle (July to October, 2011).
The model has been showcased       at a RIBA Public Programmes &#8212; A Place to Call Home Exhibition, RIBA       Portland Place, 2012, as well as forming the framework for the multimedia       animation in Peter Dillon's play `GUTS', performed as part of the Festival       of the North East, 2013.
The work undertaken on the VNG project has been       presented at, and formed the foundation for debate at the Fish Quay       Neighbourhood Plan -Evidence and Issues Workshops (2011-13) on issues of       Localism in Planning.
The model is also an important basis for a virtual reconstruction of       Medieval Newcastle, supported by Newcastle City's Historic Environment       Group, which also uses the model's spatial information in a heritage       context and its data in archaeological explorations.
According to the Tyne       and Wear County Archaeologist, this work: "is helping with the         wider understanding and management of the City's surviving timber-framed         buildings and is demonstrating a methodology which will be used to         create a VR model of Hadrian's Wall which will be disseminated via an         augmented reality app...that will have a widespread public and         educational impact, and involve community groups, who will assist in the         research of the historical data".
