     Development of Marine Energy: Testing     A senior spokesperson from EMEC [S1] has stated that the "very         idea of a Scottish test facility for         wave and tidal energy largely stemmed from discussions between HWU,         industry and government         (HIE).
A combination of Heriot-Watt's presence in Orkney and ICIT's         research into the local energy         resource, and environment, helped single out Orkney as the preferred         location for EMEC."
EMEC is the world's only accredited test facility for wave and tidal       energy devices.
It has attracted       &#163;36m of investment and employs 23 staff.
Assessment by Highlands and       Islands Enterprise has       suggested a GVA for the County of &#163;54m from marine renewables and &#163;120M       for Scotland as a       whole.
[S1] attributes this to there being a test centre in       Scotland, so they are benefits to which       EMEC (and indirectly therefore HWU) justifiably lays claim on behalf of       the sector.
He goes on to       state that "ICIT's presence in Orkney plays an important part in         maintaining Orkney's undoubted         high profile in the world of marine energy".
OpenHydro was the first developer to use the tidal test site at the Fall       of Warness off the island of       Eday when its test rig and 250kW open centred turbine were installed.
In       2008, the device was the       first tidal turbine to be grid connected in Scotland and subsequently the       first to successfully       generate electricity to the national grid in the UK.
Since 2008, over 15       companies (including E.On,       Scottish Power, and Scotrenewables Tidal Power), have used the test       facility at EMEC.
Scotrenewables Tidal Power Ltd (SRTP) and associated companies in Orkney       now employ over       25 people locally having raised over &#163;17m capital in the development tidal       turbine designs.
Initial       designs were developed through a Royal Society of Edinburgh Enterprise       Award to an ICIT PhD       student.
The Fellow, now a senior company spokesman [S2] attests "My         research on the Heriot-Watt         Campus provided the vital springboard in the field of marine renewables".
SRTP have       developed an innovative floating tidal energy converter known as the       Scotrenewables Tidal       Turbine.
Nine different scale models of the device have been tested       extensively over the past 10       years both offshore and in laboratory environments.
The culmination of       this development work has       been the construction of the 250kW prototype which weighs 100 tonnes and       measures 33 metres       long towards the end of 2010.
The device was successfully connected to the       national grid at the       European Marine Energy Centre at the end of March 2011.
In March 2010, the Crown Estate announced 1.2GW of marine energy leases       in Orkney waters       and the wider Pentland Firth, which included an estimated &#163;3 billion of       related capital investment, A       senior member of Orkney Islands Council [S3], observed that "none of it         would have happened         without the foresight of Heriot-Watt University and its presence in         Orkney".
Development of Marine Energy: Planning, and socio-economic &amp;         environmental impacts     European legislators have adopted ambitious policy initiatives relevant       for the oceans, seas and       coasts, to be implemented in the next 10 to 20 years.
These initiatives       include the 2008 Marine       Strategy Framework Directive (2008/56/EC), the 2009 Renewable Energy       Directive (2009/28/EC)       and more recently the Proposal for a Directive to establish a framework       for maritime spatial       planning and integrated coastal management (COM 2013:133).
The MESMA       Project deliverables       and associated publications make an important contribution to the draft       Directive.
MESMA       research is focused on development of a generic marine spatial planning       framework to inform       policy and practice in Europe and beyond.
The Pentland Firth and Orkney       Waters (PFOW).
PFOW       area is a UK designated `Marine Energy Park' in 2012, and the Marine       Spatial Plan is a pilot which       sets the standard for all Scottish waters.
A member Marine Scotland's       Marine staff responsible for       managing the development of the Plan [S4] notes the significant "work         put into the workshops and         public consultation events during July 2013 [by ICIT] for the Planning         Issues and Options and draft         Environmental Report consultation papers for the Pentland Firth and         Orkney Waters (PFOW)         marine spatial plan.
Our collaboration has worked well and we have         benefited from our different         but mutually complementary skills- the added dimension which HWU and the         MESMA programme         have brought to the preparation of the PFOW plan has been invaluable."
The strength of ICIT's links with policy organisations in both the       development of research and       delivery of impact is recognised for example by senior staff in Marine       Scotland responsible for       Marine Energy development across the country [S5].
They pay particular       attention to ICIT's       "willingness to increase their understanding of end-user needs" and       this has been instrumental in       determining "the extent of future marine renewables development, and         clarify our understanding of         the ecological impacts of these technologies".
Wider Economic Impacts in Orkney     "Activity at the Orkney campus is predominantly research driven"       and accounts for "nearly 6% of         the Gross Value Added (GVA) of the Orkney economy and supports more than         2% of employment         on the Islands" (Biggar Economics 2012[S6]).
The Orkney campus has been a particularly significant source of start-up       activity.
A report       commissioned by Highlands and Islands Enterprise in 2011 (Westbrook       2011[S7]) identified 10       active start-up companies that had been established by former students and       staff at the Orkney       campus.
Taken together these businesses employ 90 FTEs, 88 of whom are       based in Orkney.
Through these spin-outs the Orkney Campus has contributed &#163;8.8m in GVA to       the local Orkney       economy, with the direct creation of 119 jobs and rather more "if the         initiative in putting forward the         initial case for a test centre, and its lobbying for EMEC to be located         in Orkney was also quantified         in terms of net additional employment in the islands" (Westbrook       2011[S7]).
The presence of such       research activity in remote areas is a significant factor in the number       and sustainability of this       economic activity; "if the Orkney campus did not exist, the founders of         these businesses would         probably be located elsewhere in Scotland in areas that may offer more         employment opportunities         and therefore fewer incentives to start-up independently" (Biggar       Economics 2012[S6]).
In addition,       most of these start-ups relate directly to the environmental/energy       research developed at ICIT       (including Scotrenewables, Aquetera, Xodus Aurora, North Isles       Environmental Ltd., Credo Green,       Opus Plus Ltd.) (Table 7.5 in Biggar Economics 2012[S6]).
Scotrenewables employs over 25 people having raised over &#163;17m capital in       the development of its       tidal turbine.
Scotrenewables [S2] confirmed "Without ... the ongoing         support from the Heriot-Watt         research activity, the establishment of Scotrenewables Tidal Power and         associated companies in         Orkney would certainly not have been possible".
Environmental impacts research has informed and led to the creation of       specialist environmental       consultancies such as Aquatera.
Aquatera employs over 15 members of staff       in Orkney and over       25% are Heriot-Watt graduates (www.aquatera.co.uk).
