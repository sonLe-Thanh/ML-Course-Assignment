     In the years since its formation, Senceive Ltd has established itself as       the preferred provider of wireless remote condition monitoring for       geotechnical and railway projects in the UK, leading to significant commercial         benefits for both Senceive and its customers.
The company's Flatmesh       product range &#8212; launched in May 2009 and based upon UCL-developed wireless       mesh technology &#8212; provides a highly robust, reliable and easy-to-deploy       asset monitoring solution.
Flatmesh enables the owners of         geotechnical, rail and construction infrastructure to accurately and         efficiently monitor their highly valuable and often difficult to access         assets and in a manner which is significantly more cost-effective       compared to alternatives such as manual monitoring, wired solutions or       emerging technologies such as fibre optics.
The innovative nature of the       Senceive monitoring solution has been widely recognised, with for example       a high-profile Tunnelling product innovation award being secured in       November 2012 [a].
The impact of adopting the Senceive solution for monitoring projects is       illustrated through a 2011 deployment at Bond Street underground station       [b], which was undergoing a &#163;300m major redevelopment with the objective       of increasing capacity, improving accessibility and creating an       interchange with Crossrail.
In the design phase of the project, a need was       identified for grouting works to be undertaken in voids that had formed       around the Jubilee Line tunnel linings in order to stabilise the tunnels       prior to commencement of the station reconstruction works.
Early in the       project, it became clear that a highly flexible, safe and reliable system       to monitor movement within existing tunnels during the grouting works was       needed, given the risks to personnel and tunnelling infrastructure if       attempts were made to pump significant amounts of excess grout into the       voids.
A solution was delivered which utilised Senceive's high-resolution       wireless tilt meters mounted on tunnel lining segments using novel       magnetic fixings, with individual rotational and linear equivalent       movements being displayed on Senceive's Webmonitor software.
Halcrow's       Associate Director Tunnels said of the project: "There was simply no       credible solution other than that developed with Senceive.
The system         made significant savings to the cost of the works, which would have       been much more labour-intensive, time-consuming and slower if a       mechanically fixed wired solution had been used" [c].
Tunnelling Journal       estimates that the Senceive solution saved an estimated &#163;1 million       compared to conventional techniques [d].
The Innovation Director at       Costain, another partner on the project, said: "Remote monitoring is an       important service we are providing to our customers.
It reduces costs       compared to traditional methods and allows our teams to remotely         monitor assets safely during construction and through the life of       the asset.
Remote monitoring is all about providing intelligent solutions       to our customers to enhance their business performance and reducing         the cost of infrastructure delivery.
We are pleased to be able to       support Senceive to bring innovation to make our delivery more efficient"       [c].
More recent deployments include a major tunnel re-lining project in       2012/13 on the Jubilee Line between Bond St and Baker St, where Senceive       was retained directly by Tubelines due to the company's unique ability to       satisfy the challenging project-monitoring requirements imposed by       remedial works that needed to be undertaken efficiently during limited       periods (i.e.
evenings and selected weekends) when trains did not run.
The       problem that Senceive was assisting in resolving was covered by BBC News       [e] and in respect of the Senceive solution, the Lead Tunnel Engineer at       Tubelines said: "Flatmesh and its enhanced integrated communications hub       is an innovative, unique and appropriate combination of leading-edge       technologies, developed by Senceive and specifically adapted for       tunnelling applications.
It offers the opportunity for a "totally       wire-free solution" from tunnel to surface for challenging short- and       long-term engineering works for which there is no credible existing         alternative" [f].
In addition since 2012, Amey has used Senceive's solutions on an       increasing number of sites to deliver a structural monitoring capability       for their UK-wide Civil Examination Framework Agreement (CEFA) contract       for Network Rail.

Finally, in July 2013,       Senceive secured a major contract with Canary Wharf Contractors to provide       an underground tunnel monitoring system on the Northern and Bakerloo       Lines, as part of the Shell Centre re-development project taking place on       London's South Bank.
The significance of this contract was that Senceive's         solution displaced competing monitoring approaches ranging from       laser-based electronic theodolites (feasibility issues due to space       constraints), fibre-optics (expensive and unproven) and wired solutions       (expensive and inflexible) [h] and thus provided strong and timely       evidence of the impacts that wireless monitoring can deliver to the       geotechnical and railway industries.
The overall commercial opportunity that Senceive is addressing in the       rail and construction markets is of significant economic importance, with       the Institute of Civil Engineers (ICE) estimating that the UK alone will       spend around &#163;50 billion per annum until 2030 [i] to address historic       underinvestment, deliver new projects such as HS2 and transition to a       low-carbon economy.
The utilisation of Senceive's wireless remote asset       monitoring platform by supply chain partners such as Amey, Costain,       Balfour Beatty Rail and Getec (part of the Keller Group) enables         companies to secure significant competitive advantages when       tendering for construction and maintenance contracts at home and overseas.
More broadly, wireless sensor network technologies remain an area of       significant commercial interest, with market research reports (e.g.
IDTechEx [j]) predicting that the market for wireless sensor network       solutions will grow from around $0.45 billion in 2011 to around $2 billion       by 2021.
Finally from an economic impact perspective, Senceive is a small       but increasingly important contributor to the growth of the       knowledge-based economy in London.
The company has achieved its success       after a relatively modest investment, having raised &#163;450,000 of seed       investment together with grants from the London Development Agency &amp;       Technology Strategy Board of &#163;220,000 during the REF impact period.
Company turnover has risen consistently over the past three years, with       the year to 31 July 2013 generating revenues in excess of &#163;600,000 (a       four-fold increase on 2012), whilst from an employment perspective, the       company currently employs eight graduate or higher level staff (2 in 2007)       from offices located in Putney, London [h].
