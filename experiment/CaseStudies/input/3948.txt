     The research's identification of the typical clinical characteristics of       chronic cough pointed directly       to gaseous non-acid airway reflux as the precipitating feature which       sensitises the upper airway.
This pioneered a markedly different approach to chronic cough aetiology       and therapy based on the       diagnosis and treatment of reflux and enshrined in the national       guidelines.
The proof that up-       regulation of cough receptors underlies the airway hypersensitivity seen       in patients suffering from a       range of respiratory disease pointed the way to new therapeutic avenues       such as the now       widespread use of pro motility agents.
The up-regulation of these       nociceptors (demonstrated in       Ref 3) underpins the hypersensitivity hypothesis and is now a major target       for therapy e.g.
TRPA1       antagonists such as GRC 17536.
The research has dramatically transformed the view of cough as evidenced       by the ERS and       European Lung Foundation surveys (2013 Congress) of doctor and patient       attitudes.
Changing       this common symptom from intractable heart-sink into a distinct clinical       entity allowing novel       treatments greatly impacts on a patient's quality of life.
Specific impacts which have occurred since January 2008 to present       include:            A company and website (see Ref 6) www.selfnostics.com         offers online cough diagnosis for         patients worldwide, with further advice available at a charge.

Development of the Hull Automated Cough Counter to measure the impact         of cough on         patients' lives objectively.
It is in clinical use in 3 national cough         centres (Belfast &#8212; testimonial         from Senior Lecturer in Medicine; Birmingham and Hull) in the UK and was         chosen by the         sponsors of 5 clinical studies (including Schering Plough, Philips and         Proctor &amp; Gamble) in over         250 patients to objectively measure anti-tussive activity.
Standardisation of cough challenge methodology and adoption into the         international guidelines,         allowing for drugs to be tested in an objective fashion and for new         agonists to be identified.
The         production of the British Thoracic Society and European Thoracic Society         guidelines on chronic         cough and European Respiratory Society guidelines on cough methodology.
Professor Morice         was the Chair and first author on all of these guideline documents.
More         recently, guidelines on         the management of cough in lung cancer have also been produced.
The         effects of such         national guidelines are difficult to quantify, but the websites of the         British Thoracic Society and         European Thoracic Society indicate a total of over 10,000 downloads of         the guidelines         demonstrating both the degree of the problem and the success in         providing information to         address it.
Clinical studies have been informed by rational clinical practice.
Cough is a difficult therapeutic         area and most recent studies have failed to show effects greater than         placebo.
The resulting         economic benefits are therefore difficult to quantify since drug         development is often halted.
However patients are now spared the promotion of drugs that are without         an adequately proven         evidence base.
For example the data from the University of Hull cough         clinics demonstrated an         insignificant effect of SCH169734 in chronic cough allowing Merck         Schering Plough to halt         product development.

Similarly, butamirate (Novartis Consumer Health) had no activity         against challenge whereas the         positive licensed control dextromethorphan was shown to be a potent         antitussive agent.
Unfortunately the latter product continues to be marketed in Europe, but         the British consumer         has been protected.

The underpinning research has also led to nociceptors being cloned and         expressed within         human cells (funded by Proctor &amp; Gamble) and used in house by the         company to test the         effectiveness of potential cough products.
Clinical research work has         supported development of         the "Vics First Defence" product range by Proctor &amp; Gamble by         demonstrating product efficacy         sufficient to obtain licensing authorisation.
Continued collaboration         between the University of         Hull and the Company is seen as mutually beneficial; highly productive         in terms of clinical         product development and further basic science research.

Media coverage &#8212; the underpinning research has been given extensive       international media and       press coverage including BBC Radio 4 Case Notes and Inside Health, BBC       News website, The       Daily Mail and The Telegraph (Audience figures are 1.2 million for both       Case Notes and Inside       Health, verified by Paula McGrath, Producer, BBC Science Radio Unit).
Parts of the underpinning research were undertaken in collaboration with       other HEIs as follows:     Ref 1 - Researchers at the University of Leeds co-ordinated the       distribution of a questionnaire       which gathered survey data for Professor Morice's research.
Ref 2 - The panel which developed the guidelines was organised and       chaired by Professor Morice,       and included members from Imperial College London, King's College London,       the University of       Florence and Einstein College New York.
Professor Morice was lead author       on the guidelines.
Ref 3 - The research on human volunteers and human cells was undertaken       at Hull, and the       research on guinea pigs at Imperial College London.
Ref 5 - The research was predominantly undertaken by Hull researchers,       with statistical analysis       by the University of York.
