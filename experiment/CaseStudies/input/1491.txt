     Gardner's team's research on parenting interventions has had significant       impact on central policy       relating to parenting and child behaviour both within the UK and beyond.
Impact 1- UK policy     Persistent antisocial behaviour in children is a major social       issue.
The public costs, incurred by       multiple systems, are estimated at &#163;250,000 per child by age 27 (Sainsbury       Centre for Mental       Health, 2009).
Thus the case for needing to implement interventions that       can reduce these       problems is very compelling.
A decade ago, very little UK policy on       parenting interventions was       based on rigorous empirical evidence.
Policy shifted in the late 2000s,       with spending targeted       increasingly on parenting interventions that had been found by Gardner's       team (among others) to       be effective for improving child outcomes in randomised trials [R1,         R3].
Gardner made substantial       contributions (authoring three chapters) to an influential government       report `Support from the Start'       (2004), which cites early findings from her Oxford trial [R1],       and which was highly significant to this       debate, and to driving subsequent policy shifts [C2, C3].
Drawing on these UK trials, Gardner was then invited in 2006 to be a       member of the expert       advisory panel for heath-led parenting interventions for the Prime       Minister's Strategy Unit.
This       panel helped to devise the strategy, piloting, implementation, and testing       of a national rollout of an       evidence-based home-visiting programme for vulnerable families, which       began in 2009 [C2].
Gardner's team's UK research was also a key contributor to bringing about       the introduction of the       National Academy of Parenting Practitioners (NAPP) in November 2007.
NAPP       aimed to       `transform the quality and size of the parenting workforce', in order to       improve parenting and       children's well-being, by training large cohorts of staff in       evidence-based parenting interventions,       particularly those tested in Gardner's UK trials [C2, C3].
As       explained by the then Deputy Director       of the Social Exclusion Task Force at the Cabinet Office [C2], who       played a major part in driving       New Labour policies on early parenting interventions in the late 2000's: "Support         from the Start"         and Gardner's UK trials [R1-3] were highly         influential in creating momentum towards these major         policy developments, including the very substantial roll out led by the         National Academy of         Parenting Practitioners (NAPP) from 2008.
The founder and research director of NAPP [C3] adds to this:         Gardner's research was pivotal in         helping persuade the Cabinet Office to set up NAPP.
Her trial [R1]         was the first in the world to         show that parenting programmes could be effective in reducing severe         antisocial behaviour,         outside the narrow confines of child mental health services, showing         that the voluntary sector could         do just as good a job with difficult cases.
Influenced by these         findings, the government awarded         &#163;35 million to NAPP to disseminate evidence-based parenting programmes         across the voluntary         sector; this is estimated to have benefited over 150,000 children;         Gardner was an important         member of its steering group to ensure this research was implemented.
Prominent commentators on family policy also attribute this policy shift       to Gardner's trials: Jane       Lewis (2011), in a recent article sees these trials as the key research       driver of this policy shift:       "Second, a small number of evaluations of ... EBPPs (evidence-based         parenting programmes)         have been undertaken in England using RCTs, ... obtaining positive         results for disadvantaged as         well as more advantaged families...[Scott 2001, Gardner et al.
2006,         2010, Hutchings et al.
2007]       [R1-3].
These have played a part in influencing central         government policy to ...provide financial         incentives for LAs to adopt this type of programme rather than untested         home-grown variants".
Gardner's team's research is frequently cited in influential systematic       reviews, guidelines, and       policy documents [see C4-7 for Cochrane, Campbell and other       reviews].
For example, four of the       trials [R1-6] have been cited in the NICE Guidelines (National       Institute of Health and Clinical       Excellence); the Chair confirms their policy influence [C3]: As         Chair of the NICE Guideline on         antisocial behaviour and conduct disorders, I oversaw the marshalling of         the evidence which has to         be relevant to British practice, and Gardner's work was important in         shaping the recommendations,         since it showed that the interventions work in Britain &#8212; not all         psychosocial interventions developed         in the USA do this.
Their work also added to the plausibility of the         recommendations since it         demonstrated that the mediating mechanism was an increase in positive         parenting.
In this way, Gardner's research [R1-7] has contributed to       substantial policy change and       investment in parenting interventions, across multiple sectors, including       health, social care and the       voluntary sector, in the UK and across the world.
Impact 2: International Policy     As stated by the Head of Research and Development, Swedish National Board       of Health &amp;       Welfare [C1]: Gardner's research influenced parenting         interventions in Europe; they showed that         US parenting interventions could be transferable to European health and         social systems, and         contributed to a shift in practice and policy in multiple countries.
Her         recent innovative research on         cross-country transportability has stimulated a good deal of policy         debate and further government         research on cross-country adaptation in Sweden.
Since then, many       countries have implemented       and tested these programmes, and cite the Oxford research in numerous       reports on parenting       trials (e.g.
from Sweden, Norway, Ireland, Holland, Portugal [C1]).
In many of these countries,       evaluators have closely followed the questions and methods Gardner used to       test mechanisms of       change and subgroup effects in her trials.
Gardner has also been       invited to participate in policy       deliberations regarding the introduction of parenting programmes       internationally.
For example:            New Zealand (2011): Gardner presented the research to 300         practitioners and policymakers at         the Werry Centre, responsible for nationwide rollout, and in 2012 as         Rotary Scholar, presented to         the NZ Royal College of Psychiatrists.
The head of national workforce         development [C9] states         that: Gardner's UK trials [R1-3] have been           influential in determining national policy, as they           demonstrated that US interventions could be effective in social care           systems that are more           similar to New Zealand's, and that they could work in non- specialised           community services in the           NGO sector.
Over 1500 practitioners have now been trained in the           programme Gardner tested.
Slovenia (2013): Gardner presented findings to the national         professional body for Child         Psychiatrists and Psychologists, appearing on Radio Slovenia, which led         to further policy         discussions with the Ministry of Health, and initiation of several         projects to implement evidence-         based parenting programmes in schools and clinics.
Estonia (2011): Gardner presented findings to the Head of the         Government Department of         Children and Families, and other policymakers and practitioners.
Research presented on her UK         trials [R1-3] at this visit contributed to a debate and a shift         in Estonian policy toward adopting the         parenting programme Gardner had tested, rather than others.
Malta (2012): Gardner was invited to Parliament to discuss         evidence-based parenting         programmes with the (then Shadow) Minister for Social Policy and         Spokesperson for the Family.
Following this, the new Minister for the Family has initiated policy         guidance on Positive Parenting.
Gardner's research has also had direct influence on international       organisations such as       UNODC [C6], and WHO [C7, C10].
As the WHO Violence       Prevention Initiative, Technical Officer,       explains: Gardner's research has had a very significant impact on         policy and practice in high,         middle and low income countries.
Indeed her research has been central to         a shift that has occurred         within WHO's Violence Prevention Unit, whereby parenting interventions         have been selected as         the first of four priority violence prevention strategy we plan to scale         up in coming years.
Her       research team are working directly with the WHO to develop, test, and       scale up parenting       programmes for developing world settings in South Africa, with future       randomised trials planned in       countries such as Brazil, the Philippines, and Ghana [C10].
In the USA, Gardner's parenting intervention research has led directly to       her appointment to the       Board of `Blueprints for Healthy Youth Development' [C8], a       longstanding US violence prevention       organisation, until recently funded by the US government Office of       Juvenile Justice and       Delinquency Prevention.
Its role is to review and make decisions about       which programmes qualify       for the influential Blueprints `best practice' list, widely used by US       policymakers and practitioners.
Her Oxford trial is cited and used by many other influential US       policy-making and policy-informing       bodies (2006-12): Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services       Administration's (SAMHSA)       National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs &amp; Practices; RAND's       Promising Program Network;       Partnership for America's Economic Success; Washington State Institute for       Public Policy; and the       Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy.
Gardner's research therefore has       clearly had significant       impact on parenting and child behaviour policy in the UK and beyond.
