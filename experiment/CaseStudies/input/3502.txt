     A letter from UNICEF1 described the Centre for Applied       Childhood Studies' research into child sex abuse in the Caribbean as a       `landmark', stating that "UNICEF like the University [was] being         flooded with emails from organizations and individuals who want to use         the report for their work".
The study is one of only 40 worldwide,       and the only one in the Caribbean, to have been selected as meeting UN       standards for inclusion in a global review of quantitative research on       violence against children.
Seven studies considered of particular global       significance, including ours, have been identified for in-depth       assessment.
The research has been widely reported in the mainstream media,       significantly raising awareness.
Supported by an extensive public engagement process funded by the       Department for International Development, Jones' work was adopted by the       Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) and its constituent       national governments as the foundation for policy and legislative reform       across the region.
All six governments that participated in the research       produced National Action Plans on Child Sexual Abuse and named the study       as the foundation for these policy documents.
The documents were developed       from the CACS research.
For example, the plan for Barbados2       opened with the statement that: "This National Action Plan (NAP) for         addressing Child Sexual Abuse in Barbados was developed in response to         the findings of the Study on Child Sexual Abuse in the Eastern         Caribbean.
This Study was conducted by UNICEF/UNIFEM in collaboration         with the University of Huddersfield and Action for Children during the         period October 2008 to June 2009".
A key aim of these plans is the       widespread development of `culturally intelligent' child protection       systems.
In Dominica, the cultural acceptance of child sexual abuse is       being challenged through what the National         Action Plan3 described as a "sustained public         education and advocacy campaign ... to make it difficult for         perpetrators to be comfortable in public".
Research recommendations       on strengthening parenting have been translated into "work with parents         from the pre-school level on the importance of child protection and the         harmful effects of sexual abuse and strengthen their parenting skills".
In translating the research into practice, a partnership with the       government of Grenada and UNICEF has led to the development of IMPACT       (Interventions and Mitigations to Prevent the Abuse of Children &#8212; It's       Time), a strategic plan to create innovative, culturally relevant       interventions that can be rigorously evaluated in order to produce best       practice evidence for replication in other countries.
Between 2010 and 2012, in line with recommendations derived from the       research, the Grenada Government embarked upon "the most intense period         of family law reform undertaken in the history of Grenada".
Having       implemented progressive child protection laws, Grenada is now lauded for       spearheading change in the region.
Implementation of the IMPACT project       began in August 2013 with the introduction of a psychotherapeutic service       specifically designed to accommodate local sociocultural realities and       utilise indigenous strengths.
The programme, a first in the Caribbean,       draws directly from the research and is being offered to girls who have       been sexually abused in collaboration with The         Sweet Water Foundation, an NGO specialising in the prevention of       sexual violence to women and girls in the Caribbean.
Jones is leading       programme evaluation with a view to regional scale-up.
In an assessment of       the impact of the CACS research, the Director of the Sweet Water       Foundation, stated4 that the study "provided an         evidence-based framework for naming and understanding the complex         dimensions of the issue.
Most importantly, it put the sexual abuse of         children ... front and centre of the Regional cultural debate; and from         there to those in Government, Non-Government, Practice, Policy, and the         Law.
People now had, for the first time, the irrefutable information         they needed to tackle the prevention and treatment of child sexual abuse         in a systematic, methodical manner".
The Director also referred in       the same testimony to the influence of the research in changing attitudes.
Here she describes a group of men discussing the research: "They opened         up in unprecedented and highly emotional manner.
Some described their         full knowledge of historic sexual abuses against both female and male         children.
They knew about it; some had participated in it or had let it         happen by virtue of their silence and their silencing of the child         victims and their families; and they were now ashamed and relieved to be         able to make confession and rid themselves of the burden of associated         guilt.
They spoke in terms of what it meant to be a man, a father, a         protector of children.
They spoke of taking more responsibility for the         upbringing of the young men in their villages, such that the young girls         could inhabit a more safe world".
A wide range of research-users have drawn on our research.
In Montserrat,       an Education Officer from the Early Childhood Department of the Ministry       of Education, stated5: "More people are now aware of the         different forms of child sexual abuse and protections have been put in         place in early education settings; the research also played a role in         the formation of the Montserrat Children's Society and was taken up by         the Community Services Department to create new policy on safeguarding         children".
A lay church minister from Barbados reports6       that "The research was instrumental in the establishment of our NGO         called 'Action for Justice'.
This was birthed from the research as a         major focus is on child sexual abuse.
It has become a labour of love and         through it we encourage persons to break the silence".
In Grenada,       following publication of the research, the Ministry of Social Development       commissioned a review of its Health and Family Life Curriculum for       Schools, substantively augmenting segments on sexual and reproductive       health, drawing on the findings of the underpinning research.
In terms of regional impact, the study was included in the working       document for the 23rd meeting of the Council for Human and       Social Development in Guyana 2012, and has informed 14 behaviour change       programmes across the Caribbean, including, for example: The `Changes       Programme', a psycho-educational group programme for female victims of       gendered violence; `Man to Man', another psycho-educational group       programme for male perpetrators of violence which focuses on cultural       assumptions around `ownership' of women and children, perceived       entitlements to sex and the upbringing of children in relation to these       assumptions; The Barbados Ministry of Health `Gender and Youth Sexual and       Reproductive Health and Rights' programme; and the Anguilla Safeguarding       Project.
Jones has instigated follow-up work based on widespread interest in       adoption of the research.
For example, a week of training in culturally       relevant child protection practice, held in Grenada in March 2011, was       attended by 80 multi-disciplinary professionals.
In Trinidad, between       April- November 2011, a collaborative initiative with the University of       the West Indies and Stop It Now!
(USA) supported by an ESRC Knowledge       Exchange Grant awarded to Jones7 resulted in 45 professionals       attending advanced training on translating the research findings into       practice.
The evaluation of this activity demonstrated an improvement in       awareness about the multi-faceted nature of child sexual abuse, and       greater recognition of the benefits arising from using the research to       inform professional practice.
The research has also contributed to a new       regional strategy for child sexual abuse, The           Bridgetown Declaration and Agenda for Action to Prevent Child Sexual           Abuse in the Caribbean which was ratified by government       ministers from 18 countries in November 2012 at a UN conference at which       Jones presented her research in a keynote presentation.
Linked to this       initiative, UNICEF has launched a public education campaign, `Break the       Silence' which aims to stimulate action against the sexual exploitation of       children at the community and family levels.
The research report has been       listed by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean       (ECLAC) as a key document in assessing progress on Millennium Development       Goals, and has also informed the United Nation's first Human Development       Report on the Caribbean.
At the international level, the research report was promoted       in the 2010 `Strategic Thinking' section of the Communication Initiative       website, an international development network of 75,000 individuals and       organisations, generating requests from other countries for support in       child sexual abuse prevention.
In 2010, for instance, the Deputy Minister       for Health and Family in the Maldives approached Jones to work with their       Government in tackling child sexual abuse8.
The invitation       attested to the impact which the underpinning research has had in the       Caribbean.
The Deputy Minister stated in the invitation that: "We are         planning to have a National Child Protection Conference in the Maldives         in November this year.
As the Maldives is an island nation with 200         islands being inhabited with very small populations we share similar         issues that you presented in your study of the Caribbean.
We would like         you to present your findings here in the Maldives to make people aware         that we are not alone and there is a way to address it".
In       September 2010, Jones was invited to participate in the Fifth Milestones       Meeting of the World Health Organisation `Global Campaign for Violence       Prevention', South Africa, to contribute to `shaping the field of global       violence prevention'.
