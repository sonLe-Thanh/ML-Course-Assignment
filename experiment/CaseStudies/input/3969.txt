     Impact on national policy       The research was instrumental in gaining Professor Doherty an invitation       to the writing group for the National Service Framework for Coronary Heart       Disease Chapter Eight: Arrhythmias and Sudden Cardiac Death in 2005 [5.1].
Doherty's contribution was the recommendation that patients with an ICD       should be offered CR.
Impact on safety and inclusivity       Prof Doherty's research facilitated an invitation to lead on two position       statements with the Resuscitation Council (UK) to resolve concerns from       clinicians and patients about the risks of exercise following a cardiac       arrest or after having an ICD fitted [5.2].
This guidance, cited by the       British Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation       (BACPR), is the fundamental reference for all UK CR programmes and many       international programmes.
http://www.bacpr.com/pages/page_box_contents.asp?pageid=751&amp;navcatid=137     The confidence of clinicians to include ICD patients in CR programmes is       strongly associated with these position statements which are based on       Professor Doherty's research and the expertise derived from his research.
There are over 340 CR programmes in the UK with an average annual       throughput of 500 cardiac patients per programme.
The number of patients       with a cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmia, heart failure or ICD who       can now access CR due to these findings is estimated to be 10% of all       eligible patients (17,000 per year).
This means that over 100,000       high-risk patients have potentially benefitted from this research over the       last ten years.
The percentage of CR programmes that actively excluded patients with ICD       and cardiac arrest has improved from 99% exclusion in 2003 to only 14% in       the most recent national audit report (NACR 2012 table 2, page 6) [5.3].
The impact is likely to be much larger if other international CR       programmes were to be taken into account.
Impact on the public.
This has two components:            Professor Doherty was a co-author with the Arrhythmia Alliance on         exercise advice for patients with an ICD [5.4] and was invited annually         to share his research and give practical tips to patients and carers on         how to exercise safely [5.5].
He was also invited by the BHF to publish         an online guide for patients and carers on how to exercise safely at         home [5.6].
The exercise programme in Doherty's RCT has continued to be used at         Manchester Heart Centre and York Hospital since 2002 and 2004         respectively.
The proven benefits from completing exercise-based CR         coupled with an average completion rate of 500 patients per year, per         site, is estimated to have impacted on around 11,000 cardiac patients         [5.7].
Impact on clinical guidance (national)     Doherty's research informed clinical practice in the `exercise guidance'       of the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Cardiac Rehabilitation       [5.8].
In 2007 and in 2012 Prof Doherty's research informed the BACPR       Standards and Core Components for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and       Rehabilitation which promotes CR for patients fitted with an ICD [5.9].
Impact on clinical practice (international)     Prof Doherty's research informed the European Association for       Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation guidelines for exercise in       cardiovascular disease.
His research was directly cited with reference to       ICD patients and exercise [5.10].
Doherty has developed post-doctoral       research with one of his former PhD students (Nor Razaob) with the       Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia where they are investigating exercise       interventions in patients with cardiac disease.
Research does not automatically translate into practice but requires hard       work to convince clinicians and patient groups that change is needed and       that more CR programmes should include high-risk patients.
Professor       Doherty has committed significant time and effort to presenting his       research in keynote and invited national and international presentations:            `Risk and beneficial effects of strength training on the         cardiovascular system', European Society of Cardiology.
