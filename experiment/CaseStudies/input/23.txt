     Three examples were selected to demonstrate our praxis engagement with       diverse users including policymakers, civil society activists, victims,       former combatants and the general public in Northern Ireland.
The examples       demonstrate how these local activities can influence international       practice and theorisations of TJ.
Consultative Group on the Past (CGP): The most significant       policy initiative to find a comprehensive solution to dealing with the       past was launched in 2007, when the Secretary of State for NI announced       the establishment of an independent Consultative Group, lead by Lord Eames       and Denis Bradley.
The group held consultations in 2008 and issued its       report in 2009.
TJI researchers engaged directly with CGP and the report       cites research by several TJI scholars, e.g.
In a written submission, Campbell &amp; Turner made recommendations         that were adopted in the Group's report: e.g.
that investigations by the         Police Ombudsman provided a template for a unit to be established in         Truth Commission; that special mechanisms be developed for identifying         patterns of violations (and thus appropriate remedies); and that the         basis for establishing such mechanisms be under a British-Irish         Agreement, with legislation in both jurisdictions.
Hamber made a written submission and held direct meetings with CGP         members, in which he articulated precise and useable methods to include         and give recognition to victims.
The final emphasis of the CGP on         prioritising the needs and experiences of victims reflects substantially         his scholarly work.
As Chair of Healing Through Remembering, the leading         NGO addressing the legacy of the past, Hamber was also instrumental in         shaping the substantive content of its engagement with the CGP as well         as the content of its publications.
HTR's Director states that Hamber         had `an invaluable input into the formation of policy and practice' of         the organisation.
The significance of TJI's engagement with this process is acknowledged in       testimonial by the Group's, Co-Chair, Bradley, who notes `the work of the       Transitional Justice Institute was one of the more fertile grounds that       enabled and influenced myself and the other members of the Group.
The       research that had been carried out enabled us to enter into and proceed       with greater insight and confidence.'
The CGP report continues to shape       the ongoing engagement of NGOs, governmental departments and agencies on       dealing with the past in NI.
TJI scholar engagement with the next phase of       `past' policymaking is ongoing in late 2013 with written submissions and       private meetings with the All-Party talks chaired by Haass (Campbell,       Diver, Hamber, Mallinder, Rolston, O'Rourke).
Collaboration with Renowned NI Artist Rita Duffy: TJI has       an established practice of having an artist in residence at the Institute       (e.g.
Turner &amp; McLaughlin).
TJI's collaboration with Rita Duffy, one       of NI's leading contemporary artists, stretched knowledge transfer and       broader social impact boundaries.
It enabled TJI researchers to impact       positively on the artist's work, the young people who took part in the       project, and the Quaker Cottage Belfast, and to find innovative ways of       transmitting our research findings to the general public.
TJI researchers       were engaged in all stages of the project from initial project design,       conceptualisation, implementation to dissemination:            TJI fostered an intensive nine-month dialogue with Duffy on the         experience of children, ex- combatants and women (2009-10) drawing on         published work and work in progress by TJI scholars.
This included TJI         scholars visiting and working in Duffy's studio.
Duffy's testimonial         confirms that her work was substantially shaped by the publications of         N&#237; Aol&#225;in, Rooney and Rolston, discussions with the authors, and         participating in TJI seminars.
For Duffy this collaboration enabled a         deep connection to academic articulations of harm, informed her thinking         on how art can illuminate difficult social issues and helped to shape         her methodology.
Duffy held workshops at the Quaker Cottage three evenings per week         with young people from areas that are divided by peace walls.
Duffy         sought to give voice to these young persons who live in post-conflict         Belfast by working with them on storytelling and collaborative         self-portraits.
Throughout this process, Duffy sought advice and support         from TJI staff.
This resulted in Our View.
In the book's         foreword, Quaker Cottage youth worker Doherty, explains how this process         gave the young people involved a sense of control over their lives they         had not previously had.
The project resulted in an exhibition at the Playhouse in London/Derry         as part of the TJI Summer School (June 2010) which had 35 participants,         and a collective art exhibition at the collaborative Summer School with         Hanna's House (August 2010), which had 100 participants and enabled         knowledge exchange with local and international NGO and policy cohort.
In September 2010, a huge public campaign was launched involving the         displaying the young persons' photographic self-portraits on billboards         in the centre of Belfast bringing attention to a group of young people         as an illustration of how the `past' of the conflict was ever present.
TJI researcher N&#237; Aol&#225;in worked with the artist to choose and identify         the exhibit images.
Following the formal completion of the project, the relationship with the       artist has been sustained and she has presented seminars at TJI.
Duffy       also presented the project at the Ulster Museum and internationally.
This       project demonstrates praxis research at its most ambitious, combining       academic knowledge with broader social and artistic media, to reach the       general public to change the way communities `see' the conflict and thus       respond to legal and political initiatives.
Transitional Justice Grassroots Toolkit: TJI worked with       the Bridge of Hope programme of the Ashton Community Trust that supports       conflict victims and is based in one of the most divided and volatile       communities in NI to produce an internationally recognised participatory       model for grassroots TJ, which is now being disseminated by TJI.
TJI       engaged in this project at all stages:            The project began through a series of preliminary conversations         throughout 2010 between TJI scholar Rooney and Bridge of Hope leading to         a TJ Pilot Programme funded by the Community Relations Council.
This         built capacity among community activists to engage in debates on dealing         with the past and provided a vehicle for conversations between         leadership groups of ex-prisoners and community activists.
It explicitly         built on the TJI `@thecoalface' seminar series       Rooney designed and delivered a residential programme in March 2011         for former combatants that brought TJI's scholarly inputs on truth,         institutional reform, reparations, reconciliation, and amnesty into         direct engagement with community activists at the coal face of         transitional processes.
Participant feedback reports an eagerness on         behalf of all participants to investigate TJ in the local and         international context.
In autumn 2011, the programme held a seminar         series to which TJI researchers contributed.
TJI hosted the final meeting of the Steering Committee in December         2011, at which community activists emphasised the importance of research         and public engagement by TJI researchers.
Throughout this process, Rooney developed and tested the TJ           Grassroots Toolkit (http://www.thebridgeofhope.org/media/transitional-justice-toolkit-book.pdf),         drawing on her own rich writings and the work of her TJI colleagues (see         project report)       In 2012, TJI submitted a joint application with Bridge of Hope to the         Victims and Survivors Fund to publish the Toolkit and facilitate its         global dissemination.
We are awaiting the decision.
TJI deployed the Toolkit in its 2012 and 2013 summer schools.
International summer school participants have adopted the Toolkit as a         model to be used in other transitions.
Toolkit was successfully used in         USAID training provided by McWilliams to Syrian women leaders (2013).
Ongoing work includes production of a `Training the Trainers' manual, as       well as a Gender Toolkit.
The Office of the First Minister and Deputy       First Minister confirm that `[t]he programme was beneficial for good       relations'.
Testimonial evidence supports the direct positive influence of       TJ tools on abating community tensions between the communities who       participated in the programme.
The participants also asserted that the       Toolkit produced accessible and readily usable knowledge to community       groups and activists working directly with the legacy of the past in daily       life in NI.
