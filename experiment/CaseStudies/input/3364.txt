     UoN's innovative PCM alternative to conventional air conditioning has       delivered a range of economic and environmental benefits since its       successful commercialisation in 2008.
Backed by a patent application [4.1], the technology was licensed to       Monodraught Ltd, resulting in the launch of COOL-PHASE&#174; (Figure 1).
Having       already worked with UoN on the design and commercialisation of novel       daylighting and ventilation products, Monodraught was keen to add a       low-energy alternative to air conditioning to its range, and has since       benefited from being the first company worldwide to build such a system;       thus consolidating its position as a recognised market leader in       low-carbon, low-energy products.
"The novel science and technologies underpinning the COOL-PHASE&#174; cooling       and ventilation system has elevated Monodraught's position in the industry       as innovators" [4.2]     COOL-PHASE&#174; was officially launched at the annual building industry       exhibition, Interbuild, in October 2008.
Although the industry is usually       notoriously slow in its uptake of new technologies, even without the added       pressure of an economic downturn, the system has enjoyed growth in sales       each year since commercialisation.
The original COOL-PHASE&#174; was       successfully installed at a total of 22 different commercial locations,       including schools, colleges and retail outlets throughout the UK; with an       average of six building installations at each location.
Further developments were undertaken by Monodraught in 2010 and 2011 to       redesign Cool-Phase, from its original wall-mounted system into one which       is now ceiling mounted.
Sales of COOL-PHASE&#174; are 11 units in 2011, 55 in       2012 and 48 up to June 2013; sales for 2013 are projected to total 150 by       the end of the calendar year.
COOL-PHASE&#174; underpins the major growth       strategy for the company, and the company's investment in appointing a       Business Development Manager to solely focus on expanding the sales       substantially over the coming years is evidence of the strategic       importance of the product.
Another part of the business case for       COOL-PHASE&#174; is exemplified by the investment of &#163;250k over the past two       years to make the unit suitable for mass production.
Consequently, two       additional production staff have been employed to achieve this &#8212; in total       three new jobs have been created at Monodraught as a direct result of       COOL-PHASE&#174; [4.2].
Figure 1: Graphic illustration of Cool-Phase system      Installations carried out between 2010 and 2011 include two serviced       offices in central London for Workspace plc; a refurbished IT classroom at       Scarborough Sixth-Form College; computer suites at the University of East       London's Stratford Campus; and a 70m2 school IT classroom,       where the system was required to overcome high internal heat gains through       IT equipment and glazing.
Feedback has been extremely positive, with users       comparing the cooling effect favourably with that of conventional air       conditioning and noting that problems of discomfort associated with       conventional systems have been overcome.
Customers commented that they       found the system to be "effective, sustainable and economically viable"       and delivering "a marked improvement in terms of temperature" [4.3].
Figure 2: Two Cool-Phase units mounted on the ceiling of an ICT suite in the University of East London      Analysis of system performance in the 180m2 ICT suite shown in       Figure 2 was carried out by building simulation specialists.
Results       indicated that the installation of just two COOL-PHASE&#174; units in place of       conventional air conditioning would deliver financial savings of more than       26 per cent (approximately &#163;10,000) and CO2 savings of 12.8       tonnes over the anticipated system lifespan of 20 years [4.3].
COOL-PHASE&#174; was also installed in a particular "problem" room in the Owen       Building at Sheffield Hallam University &#8212; a 90-person teaching room on the       tenth floor that consistently exhibited poor air quality and high       temperatures.
The room had no mechanical ventilation and was fitted with       opening windows to one side; but due to the height of the building these       were restricted to a 100mm maximum opening, limiting the effectiveness of       natural ventilation.
In November 2009 the University's Estates Department       initiated environmental checks.
The temperatures were consistently       recorded at 25&#186;C at a time when November's outside temperatures were       reaching only 5&#186;C. COOL-PHASE&#174; was installed in March 2012 and Lee Allen,       Building Services Engineer in the Sheffield Hallam University Estate       Department said, "We monitored throughout the late March warm spell and       recorded a room temperature peak of 23&#186;C when outside temperatures were       hovering around 21&#186;C. We were very impressed with this performance       compared to the 25&#186;C internal room temperatures we were experiencing in       November".
[4.4]     The contribution COOL-PHASE&#174; has made to industry was recognised by the       Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE), which named       the system 2012's Energy-Using Product of the Year [4.5].
CIBSE's awards       are widely acknowledged as among the most prestigious in the industry and       are presented at a high-profile ceremony traditionally attended by       hundreds of the sector's leading figures.
Recently, COOL-PHASE&#174; won an       IMPAX Ashden Award for Energy Innovation, which is a widely recognized       sustainability award, due to its low energy requirements.
The product       consumes 90% less energy compared to alternatives on the market.
Commenting for Ashden, the awards judging panel remarks: "This is a       ground-breaking innovation from an established business that has built up       a reputation for its long term commitment to sustainable buildings in the       UK.
It is no exaggeration to say this could potentially change the whole       ventilation and cooling market."
