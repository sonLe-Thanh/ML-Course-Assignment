Public Understanding and Engagement     As a result of his biographical research on Shakespeare, Bate co-curated     (with Dora Thornton and Becky Allen) the critically-acclaimed British Museum     exhibition Shakespeare: Staging the World, 19 July &#8212; 25 November     2012, part of the Cultural Olympiad (5 stars, Telegraph; 4 stars, Guardian).
With Thornton and Allen, he co-wrote the accompanying publication, Shakespeare's       Theatre of the World, described by the Telegraph (16.07.2012)     as an `impressive work of scholarship in itself' (Worldwide sales: 8,012).
According to Thornton, `It was Jonathan's brilliant idea to structure the     book and the exhibition around Shakespeare's imagined places as an     inherently theatrical concept which also takes us neatly through the known     chronology of Shakespeare's plays' (Telegraph, 20.07.2012)     underlining Bate's centrality to the exhibition and an aspect which was     identified in the exhibition evaluation as a `stand out feature'.
It     attracted over 100,000 visitors, with a total visitor spend estimated at     &#163;2.75 million (&#163;1.2 million from overseas).
The exhibition evaluation found     that 95% of visitors liked the themes, storyline and narrative of the     exhibition (70% giving the highest rating), while 96% were satisfied with     the intellectual level of the content.
75% of visitors said that they gained     deeper insight into Shakespeare's plays and 82% said that the exhibition     improved their knowledge and understanding.
The underpinning research and     much of the preparations were undertaken while Bate was at Warwick (until     2011).
(see Source 1)     The British Museum hosted a Shakespeare on Film season to       accompany the exhibition, curated by Howard and underpinned by his       research into Shakespeare on film.
The four film screenings sold out to       audiences of 140 (560 total) and the study day attracted another 68       attendees.
Howard's expertise in Shakespeare on Film has also underpinned       another 29 public events involving more than 1,400 people since 2008.
He       has been invited to curate Shakespearean film seasons for the Goethe         Institut, London (2010-11) and the first Harlem Shakespeare Film       Festival, New York (2013), and to deliver a lecture series at       Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, London (May-August 2013), entitled Howard         on Shakespeare: Stage and Screen.
(Sources 2, 3)     Purcell is a founding member and Artistic Director of the Arts       Council-funded and critically acclaimed theatre company, The         Pantaloons (since 2004), through which he brought Shakespeare to       non-traditional or marginalised audiences, an interest he pursues in his       research.
Since his appointment to Warwick in 2011, Purcell has led       workshops and given public talks about Shakespeare at the World       Shakespeare Festival Winter School (01.2013), a Globe Education Study Day       (03.2013), practical workshops with community theatre groups in Tunbridge       Wells (2012) and Rushlake Green (2013); a public workshop on A         Midsummer Night's Dream (04.2013, London; 32 attendees; ticketed)       and on Elizabethan comedy (London, 01.2013, 30 attendees, ticketed).
He       has also delivered a workshop for service users and workers of the       Westminster Mind mental health charity (London, 15 attendees, 05.2013) on       `Hamlet and Self-expression'.
(Source 2)     Prescott's scholarly interest in Shakespeare reviewing has led to       engagements with professional theatre practitioners, critics and the       public.
A conference in September 2009 brought together leading theatre       critics in Britain (The Guardian, Whatsonstage.com), with actors,       directors, academics and the public (total audience 140; free attendance       to local schools) and explored the way theatre reviewing is changing in       response to developments in theatre practice.
More recently, Prescott has       taken his work on Shakespeare reviewing into the digital realm.
Prescott       developed the website www.yearofshakespeare.com,       an interactive online archive for the World Shakespeare Festival (2012),       featuring reviews, blogs, podcasts, audience feedback and public       discussion about performances (with the University of Birmingham, the       Shakespeare Birthplace Trust and Misfits Inc.).
The website has had 40,000       page views from 100 countries.

Performance and Professional Practice       Influence on professional performance and practice has been exercised       through a formal knowledge exchange partnership, and via consultancies       between individual academics and theatre companies.
The CAPITAL Centre       (funded by HEFCE, 2005-10) was the focal point for a knowledge exchange       partnership between Warwick and the Royal Shakespeare Company directed by       Rutter (2005-6, 2007-2010).
Initiatives included the Warwick/RSC       Fellowships in Creativity and Performance (17 Fellowships in total) in       which academics and theatre practitioners worked on collaborative       projects.
The Centre hosted the Warwick/RSC playwright in residence, a       part-time Artist in Residence drawn from the RSC's Assistant Directors,       and a residential theatre company, thereby offering direct access for up       and coming artists to world-class research and expertise, and providing a       space for creativity to develop.
(Source 5) Rutter's leadership of       CAPITAL was underpinned by her work as a consultant for a number of       productions by national and regional UK theatre companies, and whose input       impacted directly on the final production.
She was embedded in the       Propeller theatre residency at the University of Michigan (2010) which       involved public lectures and workshops to over 700 participants.
She has       been the academic consultant for the RSC (The Merry Wives of Windsor:       54 performances, 32 actors, 59,400 tickets, 14,800 programmes) and Theatr       Clwyd Cymru (Measure for Measure: 27 performances, 16 actors, 6,480       tickets, 1,500 programmes; The Taming of the Shrew: 30       performances, 16 actors, 6,436 tickets, 1,718 programmes; As You Like         It: 32 performances, 7,147 tickets, 1,795 programmes; and 5 other       productions).
The Director and Chief Executive of Theatr Clwyd Cymru has       said that Rutter is `our leading page to stage practitioner working today;       her advice has guided all my Shakespeare productions in Wales and       America.'
A freelance director who has worked with Rutter at Theatr Clwyd       and the RSC has said that `Rutter was my academic consultant on two       productions, Measure for Measure (Theatr Clwyd) and The Merry         Wives of Windsor (RSC).
Her input, advising on text and performance,       impacted directly on what I directed, what my actors performed, what       audiences saw on stage, and what they read in their programmes.'
(Source         6) She was a consultant for the Northern Broadsides production of Othello       in 2008/09, for which she organised workshops and actor tutorials that fed       directly into the company's touring production (Feb-May 2009) and its West       End run (Sep-Dec 2009).
As the result of a day workshop with Rutter, Lenny       Henry decided to take the lead role.
The production was recorded for BBC       Radio 4 Saturday Drama and broadcast twice (2010, 2012; approx.
avg.
audiences 485,000; RAJAR figures); a CD of the production is available via       the BBC shop.
(Source 7) In 2010, Howard ran preparatory workshops       for the Young Vic director Ian Rickson, based on his Hamlet       research.
He became a consultant for Rickson's production of the play       (starring Michael Sheen), which was chosen as the London production of the       year by the New York Times (27.12.2011).
The director commented:       `Lots of what came out of that dynamic week went directly into the       production.
The bridge between professional theatre and academic practice       can be of such mutual value.
I would do this again at the drop of a hat.'

Impact on schools and young people's theatre       Rutter's research on children in Shakespearean theatre led to the       establishment of a children's theatre company.
Her research into early       modern cross-gendered theatre with the King Edward's School for Boys,       Stratford, resulted in the setting up of a boys company, Edward's Boys, in       2006.
Since 2008, the company has made 10 productions playing in       Stratford, Warwick, Oxford and the Globe Theatre.
Roughly 150 performers       (11 to 19 years old) have played to audiences totalling more than 6,000.
Highly regarded by students, parents and teachers, the company director       has claimed that `it is fair to say that the work has had a profound       influence in terms of moderating adolescent boys' views of drama, gender       roles and sexuality'.
The company was also featured on BBC Radio 4 Who         was Rosalind?
(18.02.2013, 10 million listeners, BBC figures; chosen       as Pick of the Week, 24.02.2013, 12 million listeners, BBC       figures) and on BBC Midlands Today (3.3.2013).
In addition,       following Rutter's `Unpinning Desdemona' project on the relation between       performance and text in collaboration with the Globe Theatre (2010-11),       and her Globe Fellowship during Globe Education's `Youth and Shakespeare'       season (2010), the Globe set up a children's company which will commence       playing in Spring 2014.
