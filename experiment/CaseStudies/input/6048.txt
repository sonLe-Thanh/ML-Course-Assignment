     The research described in Section 2 has led to pioneering and       world-leading impact upon sports competitions, and has been greatly       welcomed wherever it has been implemented, whether by Wright himself or by       clients acting under his guidance.
The reach in terms of the number of       people (players, officials, managers, spectators, TV viewers, etc.)
who       have already been positively affected by this work is substantial and       widespread.
The algorithms mean for example, that TV companies know they       will be offered a schedule that matches and fits in closely with their       requirements, which generates substantial revenue.
Wright's what-if analyses of the proposed `Twenty-20' county cricket       competition helped to ensure that it could be introduced successfully in       England in 2003 without the need for any kind of pilot programme.
As a       result of its success, the concept has since spread worldwide to       competitions including the Indian         Premier League, valued at $4.13 billion, and the ICC         World Twenty20, with matches attracting up to an estimated 1.4       billion TV viewers.
Impact on Fixture Scheduling       The England and Wales Cricket Board:       Wright has been working with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for       over twenty years.
The impact of his work on fixture scheduling is       corroborated by the Head of Operations for First-Class Cricket at the ECB       who writes that, `from the very earliest starting point to the final         publication of the fixture list, Mike's close involvement is essential.
The 2010 season would be an excellent example; we have reduced the         number of competitions from 4 to 3, changed the format of 2 of the         competitions resulting in more matches, begin the first year of a new         broadcast contract with BSkyB, will stage neutral Test matches for the         first time, and are required to finish the season 10 days earlier than         in 2009.'
New Zealand Rugby Union:       Together with a colleague from Wellington, Wright produced the fixture       schedule for the ITM Cup for New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU).
The Rugby       Operations Manager for NZRU corroborates that the impact, `can be best         illustrated by the fact that despite the many challenges with the new         format and the condensed window in which it could be played in 2011, the         competition was regarded as a great success by all key stakeholders in         the end of season review that year.
Further, it led to the unlikely         situation of two of the midweek matches being retained for the 2012         season.'
Impact on Umpire Scheduling       The England and Wales Cricket Board:       With regard to umpire scheduling, i.e.
the allocation of umpires to       specific matches throughout a season, Wright has also been working with       the ECB for more than twenty years.
The Umpires' Manager at the ECB       suggests that `The 2012 season is a good example to illustrate the         adaptability and functionality that is required by Mike as this includes         the period while the London Olympic Games are occurring and it was         essential that the planning of the umpire appointments minimised the         disruption this major event could potentially cause.'
The Devon and Home Counties Cricket Leagues:       Wright has also provided computer systems for use by the Devon Cricket       League (DCL) and the Home Counties Premier Cricket League (HCPCL) under       his guidance and support.
The Appointments Officer at the Devon       Association of Cricket Officials states that they supply `720 umpires         for 360 fixtures in the DCL, and these appointments are actually         produced in about 4 minutes!!
...
It saves a huge amount of time, and         contributes greatly to the umpire appointing process.'
The League       Secretary at the HCPCL concludes that `with the more recent demands of         both the clubs and the umpires to cut travelling costs, your programme         addressed this situation in our trial season (2011) and I am sure that         it will provide more savings this season now that we have been able to         regionalise appointments with one of our criteria being to cut down on         travel.'
Impact on sporting fixtures and stakeholders:       The benefits of this work include financial gains, substantial savings in       skilled administrative time and high satisfaction among many sets of       stakeholders, including administrators, managers, players, umpires and       spectators:     `What-if' runs enable tournament administrators to examine a variety of       ideas concerning possible modifications to the timetable structure every       year, trying out all sorts of different structures to satisfy       fast-changing sporting and commercial imperatives.
Administrators at a       professional level need not spend a great deal of time preparing schedules       for themselves and therefore their time is freed up for more strategic       considerations.
Amateur administrators are also saved a great deal of       time, reducing the danger that the administrative burden may be so onerous       that nobody will take it on and the competition will cease to exist.
Travel expenses and time can be substantially reduced for both teams and       officials, without compromising on other objectives relating to quality &#8212;       this is especially important at amateur and semi-professional level, where       such expenses can threaten the viability of a competition and major       travel-time requirements can make it hard to recruit new officials.
Clubs are able to schedule other events (such as concerts) at their       grounds in the confidence that this will not unduly upset the timetable.
They can avoid clashes with other important local events and play their       matches on the most advantageous days of the week, so as to maximise       attendance receipts.
This also benefits spectators, who are offered a good       balance of home fixtures to watch.
TV companies know that they will be       offered a schedule of matches that fits in very closely with all of their       requirements and preferences, thus giving a good service to viewers as       well as increasing advertising revenues; also sponsors can be sure that       the competitions will be well structured and stand a good chance of       reaching a climax in the final slot, which increases spectator interest as       well as enhancing the image of the sponsors.
This high-quality service to       TV companies and sponsors gives the competition's administrators a strong       negotiating hand, thereby increasing the amount of money in the sport.
Officials are given an appropriate balance of matches of different types,       at different levels and at different times during a season, thus ensuring       that standards are maintained, that new officials get the breadth of       experience that they need and that officials perceive their duties as fair       and well-constructed.
In addition, a good balance of teams and colleagues       is provided to officials, thus improving their visibility, enhancing       perceived fairness and improving experience all round not just for the       officials but also for clubs and their players.
The potential reach of this approach extends to all sports, at all levels       across the world, from highly prominent competitions such as the English       Premier League right down to the smallest local amateur competitions.
