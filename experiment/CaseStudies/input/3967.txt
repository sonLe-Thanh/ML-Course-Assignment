     The general public and most journalists view skateboarding with       bemusement and bewilderment, being unable to understand how an activity       largely regarded as child's play should be practiced by millions.
Borden's       research has played a key role in challenging this notion.
He has       demonstrated that these informal spaces are an important part of urban       space, and thus has helped create a paradigm shift reaching across the       world in how the general public, media professionals and design       professionals &#8212; as well as skateboarders themselves &#8212; understand these       spaces and the communities who inhabit them.
Impacts on the public understanding of skateboarding:     The reach of Borden's impact is demonstrated by the number and       wide range of media and public engagement outlets, reaching a diverse       international audience through feature articles, interviews (in print and       on television), exhibitions, public talks and documentaries.
Its significance       is demonstrated by the broad shifts in public opinion regarding       skateboarding, whereby the public now no longer consider skateboarding to       be a craze enjoyed by children, or a disorderly activity practiced by       troublesome youth, but a positive form of exercise with widespread       benefits to modern society.
Thanks to this shift in understanding, the       `Long Live Southbank' campaign to keep skateboarding at London's Southbank       Centre (see below) has gained over 50,000 members [1].
As the first and only major account of skateboarding, this monograph [d],       and Borden himself, are the major resource for journalists and organisers       of public events seeking to better understand skateboarding and its rise       in popularity from the 1970s onwards.
Articles such as Borden's       `Skateboarders are essential for our cities' in The Independent,       originally written in 2001, remain widely read, with its great public       significance demonstrated by this having been that newspaper's seventh       most viewed article in March 2012 [2].
The research reach extends       beyond the UK &#8212; for example, Borden has been interviewed by the Salt         Lake City Weekly (4 September 2008) [3], and for a Spanish       television news documentary on skateboarding by Televisa (February 2008).
The comprehensive exploration in his book of the history and value of       skateboarding has also been of great interest to artistic producers       seeking to investigate skateboarding, and for whom Borden's research       provides intellectual frameworks, interpretive categories and specific       data.
For example, an extended interview with Borden &#8212; along with book       extracts &#8212; provided the main rationale, structure and inter-titles for the       avant-garde film Hacking the Streets (directed by Sangam Sharma,       2009-10).
This film explores the `appropriation of urban space and the         perception of architecture by the subculture of skateboarders' by       using Borden's research on Lefebvre's concepts of space, skateboard-city       interfaces, super-architectural space, micro-spaces, spatial-degree zero,       political meanings and cultural values.
Borden's commentary forms over 50%       (17:32 minutes of a total 34:50 minutes) of that film, which was shown at       the Jihlava Documentary Film Festival in the Czech Republic (2010),       Festival OFNI in Poitiers (2011) and Festival Cin&#233;ma Brive (2011) [4].
Borden's 2001 book has also impacted on the preparations, rationale and       content of art exhibitions such as Rise of Rad: Influence of Skate         Culture on Contemporary Art, Torrance Museum, California (24 July &#8212;       4 September 2010), which quoted from it in both the exhibition and       catalogue.
Borden has advised and been interviewed about skatepark design       for the Nutopia and National Geographic television documentary on The         80s: the Decade That Made Us (May 2013), and for the Channel 4       documentary, Concrete Circus (2011), directed by noted       documentary-maker Mike Christie, and which had 916,800 viewers on release       [5].
Skateboarding at the South Bank Centre:     In 2012-13, the contemporary relevance of Borden's research was       demonstrated when it was announced that London's Southbank Centre (SBC)       intended to turn its Undercroft beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall into a       retail destination.
The Undercroft space was first skateboarded in 1975       and has long been considered as the sport's original home in the UK.
From       the beginning, SBC managers considered skateboarders an unwelcome       nuisance, and so considered moving them off the site.
Borden's research       was used in the arguments against this plan.
The campaign has now led to       wider public understanding of the place of skateparks, and particularly       the Undercroft, as part of London's lived heritage; it is ongoing and       intensifying at the end of the REF impact period.
As an example, Borden was interviewed about skateboarding's art, design,       cultural and social worth, subculture and politics in the Save the         Southbank documentary on skateboarding (directed by Winstan Whitter       and Toby Schuall, released 1 February 2008), where his comments form over       25% (5:53 minutes of 22:45 minutes) of the running time, using his       research to contribute to the argument to retain skateboarding at the       venue [6].
This video had over 3,900 plays on Vimeo and was, in       2013, an integral part of the concerted campaign to retain skateboarding       at the Southbank.
It was used by popular skateboard websites to mobilise       skateboarders; Stereophonic Supply Co., for example, stated that `this         excellent and well reasoned documentary goes straight to the heart of         the debate' [7].
Borden also contributed through his       writings in the skateboard-specialist press, such as "Hallowed Grounds:       Skateboarding at the Southbank Centre" in the alternative sports magazine,       Huck (June/July 2013) [8].
In 2013 alone, Borden was       interviewed and/or consulted on this subject by Al Jazeera TV, ARD TV       (Germany), BBC London Radio, LBC Radio.
Building Design, Daily         Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent, The         Times and Tampa Bay Times.
From April to July 2013, Borden was involved in negotiations to retain       part of the original Undercroft area, contributing both to the SBC       proposals for and to the `Long Live Southbank' activist group [9].
His longstanding research into the cultural value of skateboarding fed       into to public talks at the SBC, and into giving advice to its managers,       which in turn facilitated a reversal of SBC policy, with the allocation in       March 2013 of &#163;1 million funds and a permanent SBC site for skateboarding       and other urban arts such as BMX and graffiti [10].
This new,       prime site under the Hungerford Bridge will offer 1,200m2 of       space and 9 million footfall per annum (improving on the 1,100m2       and 7 million footfall at the Undercroft location).
Using his research       into skateboarding subculture, practices and politics, Borden, with       Richard Holland, acted as lead SBC consultants for the new site and were       responsible in mid-2013 for writing its design brief (finalised 26 July       2013), inviting specialist skateboard facility designers, assessing their       proposals, and undertaking initial consultations.
This design brief was a       major development of Borden's ideas, first implemented at Milton Keynes       (see below), of creating everyday designs for skateboardable urban spaces       &#8212; here with even greater consideration of using common urban materials       such as brick and stone (not smooth concrete), street steps and benches       (not spectacular forms), and encouraging the integrated use of the site by       skateboarders, BMX riders, graffiti-writers, parkour and general public.
Provision of tailored skateboarding facilities by architects and urban         managers:     An important question for architects and urban managers today is how to       provide and design facilities suitable for alternative sports (like       skateboarding) without diminishing their counter-cultural nature.
Borden's       work on the history and development of skatepark design, together with his       exploration of skateboarding practices and subcultures, enabled him to       give valuable advice to municipal authorities, charities, architects and       urban designers, leading to the establishment of skateboarding facilities       and recognition of the need to preserve them in the UK and United States.
In June &#8212; September 2002, Borden drew on his research on skateboarding       design and subculture to advise Milton Keynes on how it could take       advantage of its status as `as one of the top five cities in the world         for street skating' by producing skateboard facilities which were       more like ordinary streets (`skateplazas') and less like distinct       purpose-designed terrains (`skateparks').
Borden gave a talk to Milton       Keynes council planners and participated in two workshops sessions with an       architect, Richard Ferrington, community workers and local skateboarders,       following which Ferrington and skateboarder Rob Selley designed the &#163;100k       Buszy facility (opened March 2005).
Widely acknowledged as the UK's first       skateplaza, it has been described by some professional skateboarders as `the         best spot they have ever skated' [11].
Its success led to       the establishment of 100+ similar municipal facilities in the UK, ranging       from the 600m2 Fisher Lane Park in Mansfield (established 2009,       budget of &#163;96k), the 900m2 Kingshill in Cirencester (2013,       &#163;200k), the 3,200m2 Central Forest Park in Stoke (2005, &#163;561k),       and the 2,400m2 Prissick Plaza in Middlesborough (2006, &#163;600k).
All were based on principles laid out by Borden's research and as first       implemented in Milton Keynes.
These skateplazas remain extremely popular       amongst both planners and skateboarders, as indicated by a comment in 2012       by Skates and Ladders, the respected UK guide on where to       skateboard, that the Buszy `is easily one of the best block spots in         the country' [12].
This experience hence shaped Borden's       more recent contribution to the SBC redesign.
Finally, Borden's pioneering research into the history of skateboarding       facility design and provision &#8212; which recognises skateparks as important       architectural products of design and cultural value &#8212; has also had an       impact on their historic preservation.
For example, Borden in January &#8212;       February 2013 advised English Heritage on the listing of an original 1970s       skatepark, and as a result of this advice an application to list the       3,150m2 Rom skatepark in Essex was underway in June &#8212; July       2013.
Borden also provided video evidence on 11 June 2013 to Tampa's       Historic Preservation Commission regarding the 1978 Perry Harvey Skatepark       in Tampa, Florida, USA, which, on 25 July 2013, was duly recommended by       the Florida National Register review board for official designation and       protection on the National Register of Historic Places [13].
