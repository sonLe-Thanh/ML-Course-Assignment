     The impact achieved by this research covers local, regional and national       levels of governance, a range of UK government departments and a variety       of public and voluntary sector bodies.
It can also be situated within       Northumbria University's strong regional mission to: `collaborate with       universities and other organisations in the North East to improve the       reputation and sustainability of the Region'.
The impact was underpinned       by three important factors:            The case study author's extensive research expertise in local and         regional governance, his reputation for engaging with policy-makers and         his long-term involvement in regional partnerships ensured that a range         of sub-national and national decision-makers were open to the         implementation of new ideas.
The impact of the work, and Shaw's         role within this, was noted in the letter sent by the Administrator of         the Millfield House Foundation to the Vice Chancellor of Northumbria         University: `The Trustees were particularly impressed with the impact           on (the Department of) Communities and Local Government and           Civil Servants from other departments, which must be a first for           anyone in the North East' (Source 1).
The timeliness of the research was also important, as it was aimed to         influence the shape and character of the post-regionalist framework by         bringing forward practical proposals before new arrangements were `set         in stone'.
Given this chronology, the research was the first in-depth         empirical study of the implications of this major change in English         governance after 2010.
Its policy importance was in capturing a wide         range of stakeholder views in a single authoritative source.
The former         Director of The Government Office for the North East offers the view         that: `You and colleagues accurately described the changes that took           place arising from the election of the Coalition Government in 2010.
You also summarised the various shades of opinion that could be found           amongst the public, private and voluntary sectors' (Source 2).
The research adopted a `co-production' model which aimed to engage         policy makers and practitioners from the outset in identifying and         framing the questions that need to be addressed.
This approach provided         a discursive space for discussion, an explicitly practical focus to the         work and ensured that the research findings were of direct relevance to         policy development.
The research underpinned and made a distinct and material contribution         to public policy, particularly in relation to how a range of national         and sub-national decision-makers responded to the changes in regional         governance after 2010:        The finding that there was a need to develop a new flexible           network that linked Whitehall and the region was accepted and         taken forward by senior national civil servants to the extent that a         new, Cross-Governmental group was set up, chaired by the Director of         Finance at CLG.
As he notes in his corroborative evidence: `One of           the recommendations of your work was that Government set up a forum           for the departments with a presence in the North East.
I took this up           as DCLG director for the North East.
This forum was established in           mid-2011 and has met every quarter since, with increasing attendance.
It now has members from a wide range of departments, ANEC and           voluntary organisations (VONNE).
It has proved a very useful way of           sharing information and ensuring that the different departments and           agencies in the North East are up to speed with what other           organisations are doing' (Source 3).
Recent meetings of the Cross-Government Group have included a         focus on education policy (including academies), innovation and changes         in welfare benefits (Cross-Government Group agenda and minutes: Source           4).
For one BIS civil servant: `The research influenced the           development of emerging regional engagement strategy within government           departments.
The meetings continue on a quarterly basis, bringing           together representatives from over 15 central Government departments           and agencies with a footprint or activity within the North East.
It           provides a useful forum to share updates on policy developments and           shared agendas, as well as an informal opportunity to develop closer           working arrangements on office locations, civil service employment,           the take up of apprenticeships and future policy initiatives' (Source           5).
The research finding that the localism agenda offered new creative           ways of directly bringing together civil servants and key regional           stakeholders was accepted and taken forward by both civil servants         and regional organisations in the North East.
This can be seen in the         fact that the Director of the Association of North East Councils (ANEC)         and of Voluntary Organisations North East (VONNE) are both members of         the Cross-Government Group.
The Director of VONNE commented that `it           is rare in my experience to see real tangible results stemming from           policy funded projects.
I wish that I could have videoed the Cross           Government meeting that I went to on Friday.
It was an extremely           valuable use of three hours.
Most of the major Government departments           were represented at a senior level.
It was clear that they were           informing each other and joining things up.
This group was brought           about as a result of the Millfield House funded work.
It is valuable           and it is making a difference'.
(Source 6)           The research finding that there is still a need for regional `voice'         and for developing new more creative and flexible approaches to regional         collaboration in period of rapid change was accepted by a wide range       of individuals and organisations involved in the original research.
As a       result of this, the Association of North East Councils (ANEC) directly       commissioned Keith Shaw, in late 2012, to examine the potential impacts of       greater Scottish autonomy on the wider North (both the North East and       Cumbria).
The research adopted a similar co-production model to the       initial research in examining similar opportunities for flexible       networking outside formal structures and was particularly focused on       assessing greater opportunities for business collaboration and       joint-approaches by local economic development bodies on both sides of the       border.
The research report, Borderlands: can the North East and         Cumbria benefit from greater Scottish autonomy?
was published in       June 2013 and advocated the creation of new collaborative cross-border       structures and networks, including a new `Border Visions' Partnership       bringing together the five local authorities and other public bodies on       each side of the border.
