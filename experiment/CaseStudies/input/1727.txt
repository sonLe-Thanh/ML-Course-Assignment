     When it initially came out in Russia, Rayfield's Chekhov biography       generated much agitation and criticism.
Reviews published in newspapers       and in major `thick journals' (addressed to the broad reading public),       almost unanimously objected to the emphasis on Chekhov's private life and       especially to the inclusion of numerous allegedly `unnecessary' details.
This applies equally to major literary critics such as Andrei Nemzer and       to prominent writers like Viktor Erofeev.
Reviews came out in Zvezda,       in the Moscow cultural events magazine Afisha, as well as in       numerous academic journals.
Radio Liberty staged a polemic between       Rayfield and Erofeev (03/07/2005).
However, by 2010, when Russia celebrated the 150 anniversary of Chekhov's       birth, public opinion began to recognise the intrinsic value of Rayfield's       biography.
The famous actor Oleg Tabakov was quoted stating that the       biography should be sent free to all Russian schools (http://goo.gl/YxhmPj).
The MKHAT theatre, where Chekhov's plays where first staged, placed an       extended discussion of the biography on its website.
In it, Anatoli       Smelianski, then the Director of Moscow Arts Theatre School, states that       'I don't remember any monograph by a Western scholar on a Russian author       having such success ... Nikita Mikhalkov said that before this book came       out we didn't know Chekhov' (www.rg.ru/2010/04/05/chehov.html).
The public debate inspired by the biography prompted several interviews       with Rayfield on radio, TV, and in newspapers.
The biography became the       object of a radio programme (1).
The Russian TV channel Kul'tura       broadcast an interview with Rayfield (2).
Major, broad-circulation       newspapers such as Novaia gazeta (7), weeklies (8, 9), and       internet magazines (12) likewise published interviews.
Reviews appeared in       mainstream literary newspapers (10), magazines (11) and internet journals       (13).
Blogs and reader reviews also demonstrate a lively engagement (14).
The biography was discussed at a roundtable at the Institute of Russian       Literature of the Academy of Sciences in 2010 (http://lit.lib.ru/k/karalis_d_n/text_0990.shtml).
Filmmaker Andrey Mikhalkov-Konchalovsky recommended it in his blog (www.konchalovsky.ru/recommendations/)       and praised it on Russian Pervyi Kanal TV as recently as New Year 2013 (http://goo.gl/4gG09g)     The biography was then used by documentary and feature filmmakers to       produce movies that explore Chekhov's private life and recast the received       understanding of his personality.
Evgenii Tsymbal (Bafta award, 1989) and       Sergei Golovetskii produced the documentary film The Mystery of         Chekhov (2010), released on DVD, which explores the international       resonance of Chekhov (3).
It features an interview with Rayfield, along       with Peter Stein, Falk Richter, and Alexander Sokurov.
Swiss television       (SF1 and 3sat) produced a movie about Chekhov's relationship with women       based largely on Rayfield's biography, Tschechow Lieben: Work und         Leben von Anton Tschekhow, dir.
by Marina Rumjanzewa (4).
It again       includes an interview with Rayfield.
The compound audience rating of its       various runs is above 105,000 viewers.
The Russian TV network Rossiia       broadcast a programme that similarly presents a more differentiated view       of Chekhov's personality.
Produced by Aleksandr Avilov, Chekhov in the         21C: Doctor Chekhov; A Recipe for Immortality (2010) was broadcast       on Russian TV Rossiia on 25/01/2010.
The synopsis of the film acknowledges       the use of Rayfield's biography (5).
Much the same applies to the       documentary film broadcast on Russia's other major TV network Pervyi       kanal, Chekhov; Unpublished life (2010), dir.
by Sergei       Kozhevnikov, in which Rayfield is interviewed as the main authority on       Chekhov's life (6).
It was broadcast on 30/01/2010 and online.
The biography also informed the production of recent feature films about       Chekhov's life.
The movie Poklonnitsa (The Worshipping Lady)       (Lenfilm, 2011), dir.
by Vitalii Mel'nikov, which depicts the illicit love       affair between Chekhov and writer Lidia Avilova, rests significantly on       Rayfield's biography (www.afisha.ru/movie/210231/).
In an interview published in Rossiiskaia gazeta (02/04/2009), the       director acknowledged the impact of Rayfield's `remarkable' book, which       `removes all the veils, destroys all the stereotypes about the writer' (www.rg.ru/2009/04/02/kino.html).
His film, produced by one of the two major Russian film studios, features       famous actors such as Oleg Tabakov and Svetlana Kriuchkova and won two       prizes.
In a discussion of the movie, Tabakov praises Rayfield's biography       as one of the books that shaped his understanding of Chekhov (Rossiiskaia         gazeta, 05.04.2010) (www.rg.ru/2010/04/05/chehov.html).
The biography also inspired a theatrical production.
The `documentalist'       playwright Elena Gremina turned Rayfield's biography into a play entitled       Brat'ia Ch.
(The Brothers Ch.
), staged in the Moscow Stanislavsky       Theatre in 2010.
The critic Marina Davydov called the play `a dramaturgic       (and extremely terse) paraphrase of Rayfield's book' (http://goo.gl/jQ3CoR).
In the US, writer, director, and producer of theatre and film Laura       Strausfeld wrote a screenplay on the relations between Chekhov and Suvorin       partly based on Rayfield's biography, which is currently in       pre-production.
Much of the theatre and film work she has done in the past       10 years was likewise inspired by Rayfield's biography.
Meanwhile in England Rayfield's biography has set a model of scrupulous       fact-based biographical writing.
Michael Frayn called it `without question       the definitive biography of Chekhov'.
Arthur Miller wrote a laudatory       review in Sunday Times, and so did William Boyd in The         Guardian.
Although these reviews predate 2008, Rayfield's biography       remains a reference.
In an article published in The Observer on 2       October 2011, William Boyd praises Claire Tomalin's biography of Dickens       as `worthy to stand beside Richard Ellmann on Joyce, Donald Rayfield on       Chekhov and Jean-Yves Tadie on Proust' (http://goo.gl/aSOHOO).
