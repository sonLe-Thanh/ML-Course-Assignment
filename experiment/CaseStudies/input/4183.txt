     The effect of the NIBR research has been an increased recognition of the       lower cancer risk in       BO than previously thought, the importance of using clinicopathological       characteristics (and       potentially biomarkers) to stratify BO patients according to cancer risk       and tailoring endoscopic       surveillance of BO patients accordingly.
The principal aim of the register       was to determine the       true clinical and public health importance of BO and to influence clinical       practice in the UK and       internationally by providing unbiased estimates of cancer incidence and       mortality in patients       diagnosed with this condition.
The research has informed changes in       influential clinical       gastroenterology guidelines.
An important additional aim was to identify       clinico-pathological       characteristics and tissue biomarkers associated with a high risk of       progression to cancer to       enable effective targeting of endoscopic surveillance or other clinical       interventions to high risk       patients.
The central findings of this research is that cancer incidence in BO       patients, although raised       compared to the general population, is lower than has been previously       believed and is at a level       where routine surveillance of all BO patients is very unlikely to be a       cost-effective use of health       care resources.
This work has resulted in a paradigm shift in the thinking       of clinicians and health       service providers involved in the management of BO.
It is now recognised       that BO patients       should be stratified according to cancer risk and endoscopic surveillance       and associated       interventions targeted at those with higher cancer risk.
Work in NIBR       based on clinico-pathological       factors has identified some groups at higher cancer risk3 and       seminal publications       have also identified tissue biomarkers that may be applied within routine       clinical settings to aid       targeting of surveillance practice.
The importance of the research undertaken within the register to the       shaping of scientific and       clinical thinking with respect to BO is evidenced by the fact that the       main publications have been       accompanied by editorials from leading practitioners in the field.1,2,4.
These editorials have, for       example, pointed out that the finding that cancer mortality in BO patients       is low `has direct         clinical relevance as well as public health significance'.
The `population         based epidemiology'       approach used was recognised as `the only way the much needed         quantitative information about         the condition (BO) and its natural history can be gained'.
The work has also drawn much attention from the scientific media3,4,6.
For example the main       cancer incidence paper was heralded as a `Game Changer in         Gastroenterology 2011' by       Medscape International, the influential and widely read web resource for       physicians and other       health professionals.3     Most importantly with respect to impact on clinical practice, NIBR       research has been among key       publications referenced in recent guidelines for the diagnosis and       management of BO issued by       the two most influential gastroenterological societies worldwide, the       American       Gastroenterological Association7 and the British Society for       Gastroenterology (BSG).
The most       recent BSG guidelines `Diagnosis and Management of Barrett's oesophagus'       (Gut, In Press)8       reference six papers from the NIBR research group, with NIBR research       providing key evidence       underpinning six of the practice recommendations made, especially the       following three:            Surveillance regimens should take into account the presence of IM           and length of the           Barrett's oesophagus segment       For patients with segments &lt;3cm without intestinal metaplasia or           dysplasia a repeat           endoscopy with quadrantic biopsies is recommended to confirm the           diagnosis.
If repeat           endoscopy confirms the absence of intestinal metaplasia consideration           should be given           to discharge from surveillance as the risks for endoscopy likely           outweigh the benefits       The addition of a p53 immunostaining to the histopathological           assessment may improve           the diagnostic reproducibility of a diagnosis of dysplasia in           Barrett's oesophagus and           should be considered as an adjunct to routine clinical diagnosis          Furthermore, The National Clinical Lead for Endoscopy, Department of       Health, England stated9.
"It (the register) provides one of the few unbiased samples of the         natural history of Barrett's and         factors that predict the development of malignancy.
As such, it is of         huge importance to the         ongoing controversies surrounding the management of Barrett's.
It has         been uncomfortable         reading for the advocates of surveillance of Barrett's and it has         undoubtedly influenced recent         guidelines in the UK and North America".
