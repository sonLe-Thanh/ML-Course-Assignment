     "The understanding developed by Birmingham has enabled us to manufacture       and develop superior quality low-fat foods.....In the absence of this       research at the University of Birmingham we would have had considerably       reduced ability... and arguably many products may not have been produced       at all."

The products included have all been launched       since 2008 or are in an advanced stage of commercial development.
In each       of these instances, the companies concerned have confirmed that       Birmingham's research has made a distinct and material contribution to the       product's formulation.
They have drawn on the findings of commissioned       research to do this and have continued to fund basic research in       microstructure engineering of soft solids at the University of Birmingham,       demonstrating continued investment in the research area.

The findings from research carried out a Birmingham has fed directly into       the investment in novel manufacturing processes and new low-fat food       products by global companies including Unilever5.1,5.2,       PepsiCo5.3, and Cargill5.1,5.4.
Researchers at Birmingham have worked closely with these and other       companies in long-term partnerships to maximise the impact from their       research findings.
The particular contribution of Birmingham's Chemical       Engineering research to the economic success of the UK's food and drink       sector was highlighted in 2010 in an independent report by Oxford       Economics: this report used Norton's research as its leading example of       chemistry's contribution to the industry and described the work as       providing "a useful illustration of the beneficial impact of chemistry         research on the food supply chain."
5.5     This case study demonstrates one key strand of this work: the importance       of Birmingham's research in enabling global food companies to address the       specific challenge of producing volume-sales food products that have low       or zero fat content whilst retaining the taste and texture required by       consumers.
"...the food industry is global and highly competitive.
This group has       international recognition of its research.
This is attracting inward       investment to the UK.
One of the clear targets for Impact"     [text removed for publication] Chairman IFR, former Chief Scientist,       Unilever5.1     Reach and significance.
The take-up of this research by major       companies has led to wide reach.
Independent research published in 2011       identified Unilever and Kraft Foods as two of the four companies most       frequently cited as driving innovation within the areas of fat reduction       and replacement.
This research also showed the importance of the issue for       new developments in food products, with 8.6% of new food and non-alcoholic       drink products launched worldwide in 2008-10 making "reduced fat claims"       and the proportion reaching 18.9% in North America5.6.
Many of the products identified in the table are examples of this       including; Promise, Linera, Flora light.
The significance of the work for the collaborating industries has been       their ability to innovate in the area and launch new products, see       supporting letters from Unilever5.2 and PepsiCo5.3.
The link between diet, obesity and ill-health is well-established and       forms a major element of public health advice in the UK and elsewhere5.7.
The wider availability of attractive low-fat options in a growing range of       everyday foods has helped consumers follow this guidance.
There is evidence that this is taken seriously by consumers; for       instance, survey results included in Defra's most recent annual summary of       food-related data reported that nutritional content is widely influential       on shoppers' purchase decisions, particularly the level of fat within the       food at 33% of shoppers, and that of people asked about what they were       doing to obtain or maintain a healthy lifestyle, 38% said they were eating       low fat versions of food (the third most frequent response5.8).
In a broader sense, these measures bring benefits for society as a whole       through helping reduce the incidence and health-related costs of obesity,       acknowledged to be a widespread and serious issue.
