     Following the research subsequently reported in Key Outputs 1 and 2, and       on the basis of established relationships with LGBT groups and research       users, Rivers was invited in 2006 to join the Hearts and Minds Agenda         Group, set up by the then Scottish Executive to set a progressive       LGBT-inclusive agenda for Scotland for the next decade.
The Scottish       Executive charged this group with responsibility for making specific       recommendations for advancing and promoting the inclusion of LGBT people       in Scottish society.
Rivers was the only academic member of this group.
As       a member of the Hearts and Minds Agenda Group and its `Education       and family' subgroup, Rivers produced recommendations in the group's       (2008) report [source 1] to promote positive attitudes towards LGBT       equality and inclusion in education in Scotland.
Specific recommendations       based upon Rivers' research were taken up in the Scottish Government's       (2008) response to the report [source 2].
These recommendations had an       impact on (1) Scottish Government policy towards LGBT equality and       inclusion in education, (2) education services provided by Scottish       schools and teachers, (3) LGBT young people and those from LGBT families,       and (4) society, culture, and creativity, and public policy and services       beyond Scotland, as follows:     (1) Scottish Government policy towards LGBT equality and inclusion in         education       The working group recommended, inter alia, that:            Learning and Teaching Scotland develop practical guidance and         materials to help schools to promote the inclusion of LGBT people and         their families through citizenship and inclusive education;       Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) develops a         good-practice framework for schools on addressing the needs of LGBT         young people and promoting a positive ethos;       The Scottish Government and COSLA actively promote the Scottish         Government-funded Equal Opportunities In Education: Guidance on Dealing         with Homophobic Incidents project to education authorities and schools;       Research is conducted into the experiences of children of LGBT         parents.
The Scottish Government implemented these recommendations by:            Funding development of the `Dealing with Homophobia and Homophobic         Bullying in Scottish Schools' toolkit for teachers [source 3].
This         toolkit contains guidance for dealing with homophobic incidents;       Distributing and promoting this guidance to education authorities,         schools and school staff, by issuing the toolkit to every secondary         school in Scotland (in February 2009), and posting the toolkit on its Education           Scotland website, HMIE's Journey to Excellence website,         and the respectme national anti-bullying service website (all on         17 November 2008);       Posting on the HMIE's Journey to Excellence website three         video clips of good practice relating to LGBT equality and inclusion         [sources 4, 5 and 6];       Conducting research into the experiences of children of LGBT parents         [source 7].
All of these actions demonstrate the impact of the working group       recommendations, based on Rivers' research, on the policy and practice of       the Scottish Government towards the inclusion of LGBT young people in       education in Scotland.
(2) Education services provided by Scottish schools and teachers       The toolkit issued to every secondary school in Scotland, and the examples       of good practice made available on the HMIE's Journey to Excellence       website, now inform Scottish schools and teachers how to deal with       incidents of homophobia and homophobic bullying.
The working group       recommendations and research on which they are based have had an impact on       the professional standards, guidelines and training of practitioners and       services in the delivery of secondary school education in Scotland.
(3) LGBT young people and those from LGBT families       LGBT young people have benefited from the guidance issued to Scottish       schools and teachers as to how to deal most effectively with issues that       might have a negative impact on their experiences of Scottish education.
LGBT young people and those raised by same-sex couples now have access to       resources not previously available.
In particular, the video clips on the       Journey to Excellence website, and other resources there and on the       Education Scotland and respectme websites, support their       efforts to achieve inclusion, to maintain health and well-being, and to       maximize their experiences within education.
Moreover, the research of the       Scottish Government into the experiences of children of LGBT parents       recognises the potential difficulties of young people in this group.
In       these ways, the research and working group recommendations have had an       impact on the health and welfare of young people in Scotland in mitigating       potential difficulties and enhancing their quality of life.
(4) Impact on society, culture, and creativity, and impact on public         policy and services beyond Scotland       The research and the recommendations of the working group have also had       impact beyond Scotland.
In particular, the `Dealing with Homophobia and       Homophobic Bullying in Scottish Schools' toolkit has had an impact on       society, culture and creativity in informing public debate in relation to       homophobia within soccer in England [source 8].
The toolkit has also had       an impact on public policy and services in relation to inclusive education       in Hampshire, in the context of education in Australia (the Sydney Region       Equity programme and Safe Schools Coalition Victoria) [source 9], and as a       source for the `Addressing Homophobia Guidelines for the youth sector in       Ireland' prepared for the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth       Affairs [source 10].
