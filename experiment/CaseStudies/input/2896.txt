     As noted, the main theme of the research that underlies this case study       has been on the extent to which central banks should use monetary policy,       along with countercyclical macroprudential tools, to promote financial       stability and mitigate systemic risk.
Primary impacts can be noted at the       Central Banks of Brazil, Turkey and Morocco.
Pathways to Impact: In addition to formal academic papers, the       underlying research was disseminated through several policy-oriented       papers [B][E].
Several outputs were also presented in seminars and       conferences.
These include presentations in central banks (e.g.
The Bank       of France, The Central Bank of Brazil, and The Central Bank of Turkey) and       international organizations (European Central Bank, Bank for International       Settlements, Inter-American Development Bank, OECD, World Bank).
Presentations of the key policy insights were also made in specialized       policy forums, including a meeting of the G20 Central Banks in Brazil, and       meetings of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Basel Committee on       Banking Supervision (BCBS).
All these presentations took place between       June 2009 and December 2012.
In addition, the position paper [B] and a       policy brief based on it were used as background material for a       presentation at the annual meeting of central banks from Latin America,       held in April 2013.
Subsequently, the paper was distributed widely amongst       the central banks of the G20 countries.
In January 2012 Professor Ag&#233;nor held a special seminar in Brazil to       discuss integration of the key analytical insights of the underlying       research in the operational models used by the Central Bank of Brazil       (BCB), with the bank's Governor noting that the research agenda introduced       by Professor Ag&#233;nor:     "...has been relevant at both an analytical and practical level to         enrich our discussions at the Banco Central do Brazil (BCB).
In         particular, I would like to point out... its timeliness given the         challenges posed by the global financial crisis and its aftermath for         central banks and regulators...
In Brazil...we had in the past and         continue now to aim at achieving both macroeconomic stability and         financial stability and need to refine our understanding of their         interaction with macroprudential policies."
[1]     Following his visit, a Working Group of several researchers was       established at BCB to implement the work program that he outlined.
Insights from the research were also used as input in the design of a new       Macroprudential Regulation Department at BCB.
In further collaboration with BCB, in December 2012 Professor Ag&#233;nor       participated in a joint workshop organized by BCB and the Inter-American       Development Bank (IADB) on `Managing Capital Inflows in Latin America'.
His presentation was based on [B], a document which combines and refines       all previous research in this area undertaken by the research team.
Reach and Significance of the Impact     Brazil: As outlined, BCB has benefited directly from the research       output.
One of the co-authors, Dr Pereira da Silva, has been in charge of       implementing a program of macroprudential regulation in Brazil, and       research outputs have helped to shape the new framework, by providing key       insights on how an IIT regime works - most importantly, the fact the       policy interest rate must respond directly (possibly in a state-contingent       fashion) to excessively rapid credit growth, and the fact that monetary       and macroprudential policies are calibrated jointly to achieve       macroeconomic and financial stability.
Dr da Silva is also Brazil's       representative in the technical meetings of the G20 and in various       international forums (FSB and BCBS).
Several policy papers, including a       comprehensive Position Paper, have been circulated in events organized by       these institutions and there is informal evidence that these papers have       helped several other middle-income countries to clarify their position on       specific systemic regulatory issues.
The research has also had a direct impact on policymaking at BCB, because       one of the core models that it uses for day-to-day operations (to provide       inputs for regular policy meetings) has begun to incorporate insights from       the research conducted under the agenda described above, with the BCB       governor recognising that research outputs are:     "...useful for us at home and also to strengthen our dialogue in a         variety of international fora including the BRICS, the Group of Twenty         countries (G20).
They also contributed to our discussions with senior         policymakers from advanced economies... [and are] also part of         the Banco Central do Brazil (BCB) effort to sponsor Technical Assistance         activities and Training Seminars involving many central banks in Latin         America."
[1]     Turkey: There is clear evidence that the research has proved       useful for policy analysis and policy discussions at the Central Bank of       Turkey (CBT).
The Head of Research and Monetary Policy Department at CBT       praised the research, affirming that CBT staff have "benefited very         significantly, at an analytical level, from the research work...       [and] Professor Ag&#233;nor has played a leading role in developing this         agenda".
More specifically, it was noted that the research "explicitly         focused on the type of financial systems that Turkey (as well as many         other middle-income countries) face...
These systems tend to be         bank-dominated and credit market imperfections play a critical role in         their functioning.
Developing models that adequately capture these         structural features are essential if these models have to be useful         guides for policy" [2]     Morocco: Similarly, as the former Director, Economics and       International Relations at the Central Bank of Morocco (BAM) notes, the       research "has proved extremely important for BAM because it is         explicitly focused on the type of financial systems that Morocco         operates... analytical work led by Professor Ag&#233;nor has helped to         improve significantly our understanding of the monetary transmission         mechanism in a bank-dominated financial system."
Again, it is noted       that the development of models that adequately capture the structural       features of such economies is necessary for policy impact.
Accordingly,       Ag&#233;nor's work on the transmission mechanism with imperfect credit markets       has served as a key input for the specification of a particular       forecasting model (specifically, a VARX model), which "continues to be         used to this day by BAM staff to establish quarterly macroeconomic         forecasts and conduct policy analysis, with results published regularly         in BAM's Inflation Report and in background policy documents prepared         for regular meetings of BAM's Monetary Policy committee" [3].
Additional Impact: The research has also benefited international       institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the       World Bank.
A recent IMF executive board paper references the work of       Ag&#233;nor and colleagues on `Sudden Floods' [E], noting that: "In open         economies, financial shocks can originate abroad and, more importantly,         lead to an appreciation of the domestic currency.
While this limits         inflation, when banks have foreign liabilities, it leads to financial         amplification by strengthening banks' balance sheets, causing credit to         expand.
As a result, macroprudential policy needs to react more and         monetary policy less, but the interplay between the two does not change         markedly" [4].
Similarly, a policy paper by the Vice President of the World Bank also       dwells extensively on this research, noting that: "One important         message emerging from this discussion is that monetary policy and         regulation are complementary instruments aiming at macroeconomic and         financial stability.
A prudent approach should try to avoid `corner         solutions', that is, putting the entire weight of ensuring price and         financial stability on only one instrument... Ag&#233;nor, Alper, and Pereira         da Silva... develop a general equilibrium framework for analyzing this         issue" [5].
