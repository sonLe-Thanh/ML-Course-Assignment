     Impact on professionals     The influence of the seminars on professionals (evidenced by       questionnaires) was perceived by respondents as being mostly on the way       they teach (88% agree/strongly agree that `seminars changed for the better       the way I teach'), and their confidence in teaching (85% agree/strongly       agree).
Somewhat surprisingly, not far behind was the influence of       publications from the seminars, with 78% agreeing/strongly agreeing that       those `changed the way I teach', and 75% saying the publications       `increased my confidence'.
There was much less perceived influence of the       seminars on the participants' status (21% agreed/strongly agreed) or       careers (20% said the seminars `encouraged me to apply for or take up a       more senior post'), than on professional practice.
One respondent was       `inspired ... to write an article for publication' and `I used the       information in a staff meeting to encourage more creativity and a cross       curricular approach to RE'.
The importance of the publications was the most surprising outcome of       this aspect of the research, as evidenced by a review of the book       reporting on the first series of seminars:     This book shows that all teachers can be actively engaged in research       practice in RE.
I have become more aware of the significance of the       small-scale research that I have been developing over many years, and the       book has reminded me of the importance of being, and remaining, a       reflective practitioner.
(Review of Stern 2006 in REsource: The         Journal of the National Association of Teachers of Religious Education,       29:3: Summer 2007, p 20-21.)
Impact on pupils and on schools     Over 20 000 pupils were taught religious education by seminar       participants during the year of the seminar, and the religious education       of over 1 000 000 pupils was the responsibility of seminar participants       who were advisors and (through teacher education programmes) lecturers in       higher education.
The remarkable reach of the potential impact, as       reported here, covers much of England and Scotland and parts of Wales.
The greatest perceived impact on pupils, as reported by their teachers,       was on their learning (74% agree/strongly agree) and their `interest ...       in RE' (72% agree/strongly agree).
There was also some significant       perceived impact on pupils being `confident in the value of RE' (58%       agree/strongly agree) and `doing more research and other forms of       independent learning' (42% agree/strongly agree).
One respondent (based in       higher education) said that `after the creativity seminars I have       introduced some new ideas for linking art in my sessions and the students       have been very positive about trying out some ideas with their pupils in       schools'.
A primary teacher explained:     I have been teaching RE to year 5 and year 2 children at one school I       supply to.
The seminar has changed the way I approach RE and the enjoyment       for the children is brilliant to watch.
The confidence of respondents in the impact of the seminars (and       therefore the research) on pupils is noteworthy.
There is also some       evidence of impact on schools.
It was thought somewhat `easier to defend       or expand the role of RE in the curriculum' (51% agree/strongly agree),       and religious education was thought to have a `higher status' by 33% of       respondents, and research seminars were `more popular or better supported'       in schools according to 30%.
As one respondent said, the `popularity and       public profile that the Westhill seminars have achieved' has had `an       indirect impact on schools and pupils &#8212; but a real one I think'.
Why the seminars were influential     Most important of the reasons given for the seminars' impact was `new       ideas about teaching RE (88% agree/strongly agree) and `time to think       about RE with others who were interested in RE' (83% agree/strongly       agree).
The seminars meant participants were `able to share ideas with       other participants' (80% agree/strongly agree), and so could discover more       about religious education research (72% agree/strongly agree).
65% felt       the impact was through being `able to connect ... research ... to       classroom practice', with 89% of respondents identifying having time to       reflect as very influential or influential.
This evidence indicates that       the value of research-informed thinking and discussion, having `time to       think about courses I run and evaluate new approaches with other advisors       and teachers', overrides simply receiving information about research.
Overall, the seminar series was an effective way of generating impact       from the research programme, with the more surprising responses including       the significance of publications, the confidence with which the seminars       were thought to influence school pupils, and the perceived significance of       the importance of time to reflect and engaging in discussion, more than       the specific presentations.
