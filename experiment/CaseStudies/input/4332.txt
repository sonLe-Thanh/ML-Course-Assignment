     Impact on Public Policy     CARE-HF has been used as key evidence supporting the use of cardiac       resynchronization therapy in a series of international guidelines at both       regional (Europe [1]) and national level, in countries as diverse as       Australia [2], Brazil [3], Canada [4], Czech Republic [5], New Zealand       [2,6], and USA [7,8,9].
Examples include:     1) European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the Diagnosis and       Treatment of Heart Failure, were initially published in 2005 and later       revised during the 2008-13 impact period, in both 2008 and 2012 [1].
These       guidelines all cite CARE-HF as a source of key evidence for recommending       the use of cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with moderate to       severely symptomatic heart failure (Section 9.2.1, reference 157 in 2012       revision)     2) American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association       Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Heart Failure in Adults       2005 and 2009 [9].
CARE-HF is cited as one of the trials providing strong       evidence supporting the use of CRT in selected patients (Section       4.3.1.3.4., reference 101).
3) Guidelines for the prevention, detection and management of chronic       heart failure in Australia published in 2011 [2] (Section 8.1; pg 36,       reference 204).
These guidelines cite CARE-HF (reference 204) as       supporting use of biventricular pacing for patients with: NYHA symptoms       Class III/IV despite optimal medical therapy; dilated heart failure with       an ejection fraction less than or equal to 35%; QRS duration greater than       or equal to 120 ms; sinus rhythm.
The 2012 expert consensus statement on cardiac resynchronization therapy       in heart failure from EHRA/HRS cites evidence from the CARE-HF trial as       influencing a number of recommendations including around use of biomarkers       in assessing heart failure (Section 1.2.2, reference 8), around       considerations for patients with CRT and concomitant atrial fibrillation       (Section 6.2, reference 264), and concerning the cost-effectiveness of CRT       (Section 6.8, references 348, 350) [10].
This consensus statement is       endorsed by the governing bodies of European Association of         Cardiovascular Imaging, American Heart Association, American Society of         Echocardiography, Heart Failure Society of America, Heart Failure         Association of the European Society of Cardiology, European Heart Rhythm         Association, and Heart Rhythm Society.
Impact on Clinical Practice and Patient Health     There has been impact on UK patients throughout the 2008-2013 impact       period, resulting from both the UK guidelines included above and also the       incorporation of the research into NICE guidance just prior to the impact       period.
In the UK, CARE-HF provided evidence that underpins the NICE       Technology Appraisal Guidance: Cardiac resynchronisation therapy for the       treatment of heart failure, 2007 [11] and which recommended the use of CRT       in selected patients with left ventricular dysfunction.
CARE-HF was one of       4 RCTs considered by the NICE Appraisal Committee on CRT-P versus optimal       pharmacological therapy alone (see p7-15).
In addition the strict clinical       inclusion criteria was adopted by the committee as a requirement in       clinical practice (see pages 14/15):     "The Committee noted that in one of the large studies (CARE-HF)         additional evidence of mechanical dyssynchrony from echocardiography was         required in patients with a QRS duration of between 120 ms and 150 ms,         and was therefore persuaded that such a requirement would be appropriate         to use in clinical practice."
(p14)     "The Committee also understood from the clinical specialists that         confirmation of the presence of mechanical dyssynchrony by         echocardiography was considered appropriate in patients with electrical         dyssynchrony as indicated by a QRS duration of between 120 ms and 149         ms.
The Committee noted that this approach was the same as the inclusion         criteria for the CARE-HF trial."
(p15)     The publication of the CARE-HF Trial was a substantial contribution       within the overall portfolio of evidence which has seen the use of CRT       substantially increased throughout Europe.
Eucomed data, based on reports       from major device manufacturers, suggest an increase in CRT (+/-ICD) use       across Europe rising from 86 units per million inhabitants in 2008 to 141       units per million inhabitants in 2012 [12].
In the UK new CRT implants       have increased significantly following the publication of the CARE-HF       trial in 2005 [12] and are now over 100/million population [13].
