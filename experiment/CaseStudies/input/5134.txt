     End-of-life care is of increasing importance for health and social care       providers as well as patients, families and society.
Death is a universal       outcome, but more people are living to older ages with a range of advanced       progressive conditions including cancer.
Providing appropriate, evidence-       based, high-quality care through deterioration and in death is a major       challenge.
Our work has provided the first firm evidence base in this       area, which has widely informed policy and guidelines, and we have begun       to work on specific interventions to improve end-of-life-care.
High-quality end- of-life care for all has long-term impact on the       experiences of carers and families into bereavement.
Improved bereavement       outcomes impact on health and costs to society.
Informing policy on dementia: Our work on dementia has had a wide       influence on national policy.
It was heavily referenced in the Alzheimer's       Society report My life until the end: Dying well with dementia       (2012) [a].
Our interventional studies informed recommendations       for the UK NICE-SCIE Guideline on Supporting People with Dementia and         their Carers (2006) [b] and Living Well with Dementia: A         National Dementia Strategy (2009) [c].
Epidemiological data       from our acute hospital studies (including output [3]) has been used as       evidence in the NHS Confederation's report Acute awareness: Improving         hospital care for people with dementia [d] and the       Alzheimer's Society's report Counting the Cost: Caring for people with         dementia on hospital wards (2009) [e].
In 2009 we worked       with Marie Curie Cancer Care on an assessment of end-of-life care for       people with dementia in the London Borough of Haringey.
This found that       found that with timely support in the community, it would be possible to       prevent some crises occurring, or in the event of the crisis happening,       provide an intervention that would reduce the need for a hospital       admission [f].
This was used as a best practice example in the       2010 NICE Guidance: End of life care for people with dementia:         Commissioning guide [g].
Influencing NICE guidelines 2011: Evidence from our research was       incorporated into NICE guidance in 2011 in 3 areas: spirituality,       psychological assessment, and advance care planning.
Spirituality: Our work is referenced in the NICE quality standard       on End of life care for adults (QS13) supporting documents under       Statement 6 &#8212; Holistic support &#8212; spiritual and religious [h].
It       was also used in 2009 in the Department of Health National End of Life       Care Programme publication Draft Spiritual Support and Bereavement         Care Quality Markers and Measures for End of Life Care [i].
Assessment of psychological needs: The distress thermometer is now       recommended as part of holistic assessment of patients not only in       palliative care but earlier in illness, in the National Holistic Common       Assessment that forms part of the NICE quality standards for end-of-life       care published in 2011 [j].
This simple tool is now widely used in       UK clinical practice as part of holistic assessment of patients not only       in palliative care but also earlier in illness [k].
Advance care planning: Advance care planning for all with advanced       illness is a key recommendation of the Department of Health End of         Life Strategy 2008 and also of service initiatives such as the Gold       Standards Framework; this is being extended to care for children and young       people [l].
Our work provides empirical research evidence to       inform policy development.
Output [8], above, is cited in the Royal       College of Physicians' 2009 Advance Care Planning: National Guideline:         Concise Guide to Good Practice 12 [m] and Capacity, care         planning and advance care planning in life limiting illness: A guide for         health and social care staff published by DH National End of Life       Care Programme in 2011 [n].
The relevant parts of these, are in       turn referenced in the 2011 NICE quality standards for end-of-life care [o].
Improving end-of-life care services     We collated evidence on the importance of palliative care in heart       failure (output [9]), which has formed the basis of Caring Together, a &#163;5       million investment by Marie Curie Cancer Care and the British Heart       Foundation to improve end-of-life care in heart failure [p].
Between June 2011 and June 2013, 232 heart failure patients were referred       to Caring Together across its three pilot sites.
All these patients and       their carers have benefited from the implementation of the core components       of Caring Together, including the comprehensive assessment of needs.
Very       few patients required referral to specialist palliative care or hospice       inpatient stays.
Many of them benefited from referral to hospice day       therapies at the three hospices in the pilot sites [q].
Work with St Mungo's charity led to an influential report in May 2011 (Supporting         homeless people with advanced liver disease approaching the end of life)       on end-of-life experiences of homeless people facing death from advanced       liver disease.
As a result of this report, St Mungo's developed and       implemented a palliative care education programme for extension to other       homeless services; a resource pack was published in February 2013 [r].
