     For news broadcasters accustomed to a policy landscape centred on       Westminster, the devolved landscape of contemporary UK politics represents       a major new challenge.
If citizens are to understand where democratic       responsibility and accountability lie, as well as appreciate a range of       policy options, the news media need to cover political issues in a way       that makes policy differences and areas of responsibility clear.
This is       especially true of broadcasting which remains the dominant and most       trusted source of information about political issues for most people.
So,       for example, the four UK nations have all pursued different policies on       education, from free schools to university tuition fees.
On a practical       level, citizens in each nation need to understand these differences.
On a       broader political level, an appreciation of these differences allows       citizens to understand the range of possibilities, to judge their       governments accordingly and hold them to account.
Our research (2008; 2009a; 2009b - see section 3) revealed that news       coverage did not provide enough information for viewers/listeners to       understand the policy differences and practicalities of a devolved UK, and       worse, coverage was often misleading about where power and responsibility       lay.
The research was one of two studies used to inform the King Report, as       well as being published by the BBC Trust as part of that report.
The King       Report adopted our main findings and recommendations, urging the BBC to       improve coverage to more accurately reflect post-devolution politics in       the UK.
The BBC accepted these findings and made a commitment &#8212; through       guidelines &#8212; to report political issues in ways that would allow citizens       to understand what their own governments were doing and the options       pursued elsewhere.
The BBC also ran a training and awareness raising       programme for staff, including Senior Editors and Producers of major news       programmes.
This included visits to the devolved nations outside England       to better understand differences in policy and delivery.
In order to see whether BBC coverage had changed as a result of this       intervention, the BBC Trust commissioned us to conduct follow up research       in 2009.
This research suggested that a number of challenges remain &#8212;       notably the London-centric nature of much UK television news.
However, it       also found that, through a range of different measures, this intervention       made a difference &#8212; reshaping the news agenda of BBC news and ensuring       that programming provided a more accurate and representative picture of       politics and policy in the UK and its devolved political institutions.
So, for example, our follow up study (2010) found that:            all BBC outlets were more likely to let viewers/listeners know when         policy areas applied only to England;       all BBC outlets significantly increased their reporting from Scotland,         Wales and Northern Ireland, both in general and with specific reference         to devolved areas;       a number of BBC news outlets have begun to use a `compare and         contrast' approach, reporting on some of the differences in policy         across the UK.
Our findings indicate that other broadcasters &#8212; who were beyond the       report's jurisdiction, operating under a different regulatory/governance       framework &#8212; have changed very little, and continue to replicate the same       forms of misleading and limited coverage we found in our 2008 report.
In       short, our follow up research demonstrated the impact of the intervention       based on our initial research.
The immediate beneficiary, in terms of impact, was the BBC, who used the       research to significantly improve the quality and accuracy of their news       coverage across their many news outlets.
However, the BBC's reach and       scope &#8212; as the principle news provider in the UK &#8212; means that there is a       much wider societal benefit, with citizens being provided with better       access to information about the nature, responsibility and outcomes of       democratic decision making.
Sir Michael Lyons, BBC Chairman in his farewell speech, 2011 highlighted       the impact of our research:     "...one of the Trust achievements of which I am proud is our decision         to require BBC News to dramatically improve its performance in reporting         the devolved nations of the UK both to themselves and to one another.
We         now take it for granted that when a new piece of legislation is         announced, BBC journalists will make clear which parts of the UK it         applies to, and which parts it does not.
We now take it for granted that         the BBC will make regular comparisons in its reporting between the way         big social issues &#8212; university tuition fees, say, or prescription         charges &#8212; are dealt with in Scotland and Wales and Northern Ireland as         compared to England.
We now take it for granted that BBC news adopts a         much less London-centred view of the UK.
This was not always the case.
Our 2008 report into the impartiality of coverage of the         Nations...marked a real turning point here" (see section 5, source       7)     The chronology of the research and its impact was as follows:     Project 1:            Spring 2007: Cardiff University successfully tender for the BBC         Trust's review of coverage of the 4 UK nations and politics in a         post-devolved UK       June 2008: The research report published by the BBC Trust as part of         the King Report, which adopts its main recommendations (BBC network news         coverage of the four UK nations: the Trust's conclusions 11 June 2008)         (see section 5, corroborating source 1)       The research is widely reported (e.g.
Gibson, Owen (2008) `BBC         Journalists accused of London bias' in Media Guardian, 12 June         2008) (see section 5, source 2)       July 2008: BBC management publish their response, including a series         of recommendations for improving coverage.
These recommendations are         manifested in various forms, such as guidelines issued by the BBC         College of Journalism (see section 5, source 3 &amp; 5)          Project 2:            Summer 2009: Cardiff University commissioned by the BBC Trust to         conduct follow-up research to assess whether BBC coverage had overcome         the shortcomings detailed in the 2007 report and the King Report (see         section 5, source 1)       July 2010: BBC Trust publishes findings that suggest a number of key         improvements in BBC Reporting (see section 5, source 4, 6, &amp; 7)
