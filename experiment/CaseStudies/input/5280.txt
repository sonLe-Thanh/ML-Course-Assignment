     The spin-out company, Sensixa (http://www.sensixa.com/),       was established by Imperial College in 2007 as a company to promote and       commercialize the BSN technology described in section 2.
It currently       holds the IP for the innovative e-AR sensor.
The sensor has been developed       to allow high volume production via manufacturing facilities in China.
The       sensor was awarded the CE mark in 2009 and received FCC approval in 2012       which indicate the sensor can be used and sold in both Europe and USA [L].
Coinciding with the London Olympic Games 2012 and as part of the UK's       showcase of ICT to the world, BSN technologies developed at Imperial were       among the few technologies selected by UKTI during its Life Sciences       Technologies and ICT Technology Enabling the Game events [A].
Our work has       resulted in innovative training solutions and sports equipment designs to       secure competitive advantage for GB athletes.
It has also contributed to       obtaining an understanding of the biology of athletic performance to gain       insights into the human physiological system for improving the health and       wellbeing of the population at large.
Outcomes of the e-AR sensor and its       associated research have led to improvements in elite sport performance       monitoring and training for Team GB in the run-up to the London 2012       Olympics, including Rowing, Bobskeleton, Cycling, Sailing, Canoeing and       Field Hockey.
According to the Head of Sports Science and Research of the       British Olympic Association this resulted in "tangible impacts for the       preparation of our athletes for Vancouver 2010 and London 2012" [B].
The       Head of Research &amp; Innovation at UK Sports state that it has       "demonstrated practical and commercial value of BSN through its extensive       trials" [C].
The Chief Coach of Women and Lightweights GB Rowing Team       states that "providing both athletes and trainers with sport-specific real       time feedback allows for understanding of training and race analysis and       performance" [D].
The sensor was also used in the rugby union and league where it       facilitated national and international teams to maintain their leading       ranks.
Specifically, work with the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats RL allowed       them "to best prepare our playing team for the next Super League game       based on the players recovery and then response to an appropriately loaded       sessions during the week" [E].
It has been regarded as the "main driving       force in the area of endocrinology, behaviour and performance" in sports       underpinned by sensing technologies [F].
By using elite athletes as the       exemplars, the technology developed has made sport and physical activity       more enjoyable and rewarding.
It promotes community participation in sport       and physical activity and strengthens the feedback loop between exercise       and health [G].
The e-AR sensor also has application in the areas of healthcare as it       allows one to objectively profile and compare a wide variety of patient       outcomes post-operatively, and create a platform for remote patient       surveillance and early detection of complications [H].
The e-AR sensor has       featured in multiple clinical trials within the Imperial College       Healthcare NHS Trust, including three trials that have been recognised and       adopted by the NIHR portfolio for further support.
Since 2008, over 150       patients and numerous clinical collaborators have been involved in the       on-going development of the e-AR sensor.
Examples of this includes:            In 2008 15 post-operative general surgical patents were remotely         monitored at home using the e-AR sensor [I].
Between 2010-2011 60 post-operative knee replacement patients had         their gait pattern assessed using the e-AR sensor.
Between 2009 and 2011 14 knee replacement patients had their         peri-operative mobility profiled at home using the e-AR [J].
In 2012, 25 patients used the device to supplement the results from         ambulatory diagnostic tests.
In 2012-2013, 20 patients who had undergone lower limb reconstruction         following trauma used the e-AR sensor every 3-months at their follow-up         appointments, allowing a system to be developed (Hamlyn Mobility Score)         that provides objective recovery information to patients, surgeons and         service managers [K].
