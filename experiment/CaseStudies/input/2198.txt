     Contemporary art is engaging, influencing and emotionally affecting       millions of people world-wide.
With more and more interactions &#8212; both business and social &#8212; happening       online, it is critical that       UK contemporary artists can effectively present and promote themselves       online.
This is a       challenge that, if addressed well, gives artists exposure, provides them       with work opportunities,       engages the public in contemporary culture and demonstrates the creativity       and innovation the UK       has to offer to a world-wide audience.
Axis (see www.axisweb.org) is a       charity, funded by Arts Council England and the Arts Council of       Wales, hosting the national register of more than 2,800 contemporary       artists and curators and their       45,000+ artworks.
Axis' role is to promote UK contemporary art       internationally and connect artists       with people who want to purchase, commission, exhibit, write about or       simply find out more about       their work.
There is no other public or private sector organisation       fulfilling this role of national       importance.
Since 1998, Leeds Met researchers have worked closely with Axis.
Research       focused on how       artists can make best use of online platforms to present and sell their       work, connect with other       artists and develop their practice.
The collaboration considerable       improved Axis' performance and       fundamentally changed how Axis operates.
Contemporary UK artists would not       promote       themselves online the way they do today were it not for Axis.
The detailed       impact over time is as       follows:            In 2000 the CyberAxis Virtual Gallery was created with a &#163;30k grant         from the National Arts         Council and Millennium Lottery funding.
During the course of the four         initial exhibitions         CyberAxis received 4,607 visits by 1,213 visitors who explored and         engaged with the 3D virtual         gallery and with other visitors.
CyberAxis was a ground-breaking concept         at the time, attracting         much attention in the media and the arts sector (i1, i2).
CyberAxis is         now closed but has         directly informed later Axis initiatives to present art in an engaging         and interactive way.
From 2003 Dr Marc Fabri was directly involved in shaping the digital         strategy of Axis and         improving its internal processes and public service offer.
Research on         user interface design,         affective computing and computer-supported collaborative work had an         immediate impact on         the evolution of the Axis website and the ways artists and visitors         interact with the artworks         presented, and with each other.
Axis emerged as a digital leader in the         UK arts sector,         acknowledged in 2009 by a top score of 13/15 in an independent review of         key UK arts         organisations (i3).
In the report, Axis was particularly praised for its         digital public service.
In 2005, Axis started a new commercial business called Axis Web         Developments (AWD).
AWD         creates affordable websites and mobile apps for other arts and cultural         organisations and gift-aids         all profits back to Axis the charity, thereby "benefiting UK artists and         the arts sector as a         whole" (i4).
Starting a commercial company was a first for Axis, and it         was only possible with         the support and expertise from Leeds Met researchers.
Since 2008, the         company generated         extra income for the charity in excess of &#163;150,000 (i4).
In response to government cuts, Arts Council England re-structured the         arts funding system in         2010 and all regulary funded organisations had to re-apply for the         2011-2016 period.
The         successful incorporation of research outputs from the Leeds Met group         into Axis' services         directly contributed to Axis becoming a UK digital leader in the arts.
This in turn helped secure         continued funding of around &#163;300,000 a year in an otherwise volatile         arts sector that was         affected by severe cuts.
During the past 5 years there was also         significant growth in         membership (up 36% since 2008) and website visitor numbers (up 34%         between 2008 and         2012 to 750,000) which can be directly attributed to the quality of the         digital service.
The on-going         funding protects 10 Axis full-time staff posts and benefits the more         than 2,800 SMEs         (artists and curators) who rely on Axis for a continuous stream of work         opportunities,         commissions and artwork sales (i4, i5).
In 2011, Axis with Dr Marc Fabri and digital agency fuse8 created the         iPhone App for "Art in         Yorkshire &#8212; supported by Tate", a 10-month long exhibition programme         showcasing the best of         Yorkshire artists from the last century in more than 20 venues (i5).
Research on affective         interactions, persuasive technology and context-aware systems directly         fed into the design of         the app, which was a great success (i6).
Apple featured it for several         weeks in their 'What's         Hot' and 'News and Noteworthy' lists (i6).
The App won GOLD in the Best         App category of the         2012 Roses Creative Awards, beating HONDA, Butlin's and Best of Britain         (i7).
The app had         more than 8,000 downloads (initial target: 1000) and was used about         30,000 times during 2011         (i6).
The App has since produced several successful spin-offs, licensed by       Axis, including 'Art       Sheffield', `Ways of Looking' and 'Contemporary Art North East' which was       the official app for       the Turner Prize at Baltic Mill in 2011/12.
