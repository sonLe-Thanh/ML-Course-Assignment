     TJI's gender research has contributed to the work of United Nations       bodies, national government departments and local and international civil       society organisations.
Many of these impacts have been achieved through       sustained engagement with our research users and through consultancies,       policy advice, and translating our scholarly outputs into training       materials or guidelines.
Our research and policy relationships locally and       internationally are long-term and sustained.
Illustrative examples       demonstrate multi-layered impact.
Shaping UN Policy Making on Conflict and Gender       The UN Secretary General's Office, UN Women and CEDAW Committee reach out       to TJI scholars for expert knowledge and rely on their scholarly       expertise.
Key policy recommendations driven by TJI's collective gender       research expertise included: gender `centrality' in reparations, a broad       understanding of sexual harms as forming the basis for reparations, and       linking reparations with gendering truth and accountability processes.
Engagements have occurred in the following ways:            2002-6 N&#237; Aol&#225;in was appointed as expert to the UN Division for the         Advancement of Women (with Secretary-General confirmation).
In this role         she was a contributing author to a thematic report on equal         participation of women in conflict prevention, management and conflict         resolution in post-conflict peacebuilding.
In 2010 N&#237; Aol&#225;in joined the         UN Roster of Experts.
2011-13 Three TJI scholars (N&#237; Aol&#225;in, O'Rourke &amp; Swaine) led a UN           Study on Reparations for Conflict-Related Sexual Violence         commissioned by UN Women and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
This         project drew on N&#237; Aol&#225;in's role as an expert, plus O'Rourke's         comparative reparations expertise and Swaine's experience of working for         the UN in diverse conflict sites including Kosovo, Burundi, Timor-Leste         and Darfur, Sudan (1999-2006).
The study frames a UN wide         system-guidance note setting the approach of agencies, field officers         and key decisionmakers to reparations and GBV.
The study required         consistent interface with UN agencies and field offices in conflict         sites, providing expert advice and guidance on a range of post-conflict         gender issues.
Users are UN officials at Headquarters and field office         levels, with beneficiaries being the victims of conflict-related sexual         violence in multiple sites.
Valji notes that UN Women use `the Study to         produce Guidelines for use in the field by UN Women and OHCHR in respect         to the management of reparations for conflict-related sexual violence.
From the UN perspective, such Studies and Guidelines constitute         authoritative legal standards'.
All three scholars remain in close         contact with UN Women on the content and operation of the Guidelines         (Swaine as in-house consultant post completion of her doctoral research         at TJI).
Valji also confirms that research connecting intimate and         conflict violence by McWilliams &amp; N&#237; Aol&#225;in (2013) has been widely         shared and is being deployed by UN Women.
The influential 2010 Women's Participation in Peacebuilding:           Report of the Secretary-General setting out the UN System's         Seven-Point Action Plan on Gender-Responsive Peacebuilding cites and         relies directly on Bell and O'Rourke's formative empirical study.
Report's commitment section draws un-amended on the underpinning         research.
Bell engaged directly with UN Women and spent time at UN         Headquarters in New York to enable the Report's completion.
The influence of TJI Scholars on the CEDAW Committee's General Comment         No 30 (2013) (GC) has been substantial.
The GC establishes CEDAW's         judicial approach, setting legally binding international standards         regarding women's rights in armed conflict and afterwards.
In advance of         the GC being issued, the CEDAW Committee issued a Concept Note (2011).
Bell and O'Rourke were invited to submit a framing memorandum drawing on         their conflict and post-conflict research.
N&#237; Aol&#225;in was requested to         make her gender and conflict publications generally available to all         CEDAW Committee members.
TJI scholars Ni Aol&#225;in, Rooney, Bell &amp;         O'Rourke are cited in the Concept Note.
N&#237; Aol&#225;in had sustained         communication with the GC author throughout 2012-2013.
The GC adopts key         insights from TJI gender research including the connections between         intimate and conflict-related violence, the relationship between gender         inequality and gender violence in conflict settings, the modalities of         engaging women's leadership in peacemaking, and the required         applicability of gender norms to non-state actors.
Users are states,         individuals and institutions.
TJI is in the process of sustaining and formalising its relationship         with the UN through a Memorandum of Understanding with UN Women to         enable sustained synergy and exchange.
Training International Practitioners working on the Gender and             Conflict Interface         Producing training materials and conducting training sessions for         practitioners is an established practice for all areas of TJI research.
Some examples with respect to TJI gender research are:                N&#237; Aol&#225;in provides ongoing consultancy advice to Office of Conflict           Management and Mitigation (OCM) of USAID/DCHA (US government agency           supplying humanitarian assistance to conflict and post-conflict           countries) on the interface of programming with post-conflict gender           analysis.
N&#237; Aol&#225;in's research supported the design of training and           guidance for USAID officers overseeing assistance in post-conflict           states.
OCM training on post-conflict gender issues is benchmarked           internally against N&#237; Aol&#225;in's models.
OCM attests to sustained use of           On the Frontlines `in all USAID's gender-related policies'           particularly as they are operationalised to give support to field           offices.
It also confirms adoption of the `gender centrality' approach           conceptualised in On the Frontlines to address gender needs in           post-conflict settings.
Hamber has a sustaining relationship with the Task Force on Dealing           with the Past and the Prevention of Atrocities in the Swiss Federal           Dept.
of Foreign Affairs.
He has given advice, engaged in training and           provided expertise.
His masculinities research has had particular           influence, framing the approach of the division to addressing the           gender terrain of post-conflict reconstruction and its multilateral           decisions as a donor state.
Gender and Conflict in Northern Ireland: Transforming Conflict             and Intimate Violence         TJI staff have long influenced practice and policy with regard to         women's lives in NI.
McWilliams was and remains the key intellectual and         policy figure in the women's movement, conceptualising and devising         policy through multiple and overlapping roles.
McWilliams' (1993) study         has been pivotal to the discourses and practice related to domestic         violence in NI.
Her ability to translate academic research into policy         imperatives was enabled by holding pivotal institutional roles from 1996         onwards directly integrating GBV, gendered truth and gendered security         research to shaping political and policy agendas including as co-founder         of NI Women's Coalition; negotiator for NI Peace Agreement; Chief         Commissioner of NI Human Rights Commission; member of Prison Reform         Security Panel.
McWilliams was short-listed as UN Special Rapporteur on         the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of         non-recurrence in 2012, which is indicative of her broad national and         international research/policy influence.
Among the impacts of her         research on policymakers in Northern Ireland: informing the Public         Prosecution Service in developing its Policy for Prosecuting Cases           of Domestic Violence in 2006 and its ongoing reform on         victim-centred justice.
In addition, the current Director of the         Department of Justice NI confirms the influence of McWilliams' prior and         current research on the Courts and Tribunal Service as regards their         approach to the prosecution of domestic violence and its conflict         dimensions.
McWilliams also advances implementation of her research         findings on intimate and conflict violence with police, prosecution, and         probation services in NI through direct engagement, consultation, as         well as directly facilitating local women's NGOs positioning.
