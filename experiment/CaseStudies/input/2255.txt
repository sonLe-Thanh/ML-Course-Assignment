     Streptococcus Pneumoniae is an important cause of infection at the       extremes of life.
In the United Kingdom the incidence of invasive       pneumococcal disease (IPD) is 37-48 per 100,000 for children under 1 year       and 21-36 per 100,000 for adults &gt;65 years.
In the period July 1996 to       June 2006 (prior to vaccine introduction) there were 52,579 cases of IPD       identified through the UK laboratory- based surveillance system.
This does       not take into account the majority of pneumonia and otitis media cases [a].
The first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine containing seven of the most       prevalent serotypes (PCV7) was licensed in 2000 as a four-dose schedule.
Adding a new vaccine to the relatively crowded UK infant immunisation       schedule in the early 2000s presented significant difficulties, as infants       were already receiving two injections at each immunisation visit (at 2, 3       and 4 months of age).
Our demonstration that three doses were       immunologically broadly equivalent to four gave the Department of Health       the evidence base to introduce PCV into the routine infant immunisation       programme vaccine with doses at 2, 4 and 12 months ("2+1" schedule).
An       initial catch-up campaign was conducted in 2006/7 with routine       immunisation beginning in 2008 [b].
The introduction of PCV in the UK has had a clear impact on pneumococcal       disease.
Prior to its introduction, deaths from IPD in children under five       had peaked at 797 cases/year.
In 2011/12 (the last year for which there       are complete data) this had reduced by 50% to 340 deaths.
Notably, cases       of IPD due to the seven serotypes included in the vaccine have fallen       dramatically, as the following table shows:      Table 1: Serotype specific IPD cases for under fives in England and Wales       prior to and following the introduction of PCV7 into the infant       immunisation programme [c]                                Serotype           2003/4           2011/12                             4           15           0                             6B           52           1                             9V           31           1                             14           142           2                             18C           38           4                             19F           49           5                             23F           25           1                          On the basis of early experience with PCV7, Goldblatt worked with       international colleagues to define the first correlates of protection and       then helped to draw up WHO guidelines for how PCVs should be subsequently       licensed (WHO TRS 927) [d].
These guidelines were used to license       10- and 13-valent formulations approved in 2009/10.
In 2010 the 13-valent       vaccine was introduced in the UK.
This vaccine addressed the burden of       disease caused by the additional serotypes included in the PCV13 vaccine.
In addition to the direct impact of the vaccine on disease in the       vaccinated infants, the PCV vaccine reduces the carriage of pneumococci in       the nasopharynx, which thus reduces the spread of the pneumococci and       impacts on invasive disease in other age groups.
The figure below (adapted       from HPA data [c]) illustrates the impact of infant vaccination on       vaccine type IPD in all age groups in the UK.
The "2+1" schedule has been highly efficacious and is also more cost       effective, as it uses fewer doses.
For these reasons, many countries       worldwide have implemented it.
In 2013, WHO reports that in Europe and the       Americas 23 countries are using PCV according to the schedule we developed       [e].
Our work has also contributed to global efforts to reduce mortality from       pneumococcal disease in developing countries.
Half a million children       under five die each year from the condition, making it the leading       vaccine-preventable cause of death among young children.
In response to       this issue, WHO and the GAVI alliance have initiated an innovative       financing process &#8212; the Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) [f] &#8212;       designed to make effective and affordable pneumococcal vaccines available       for children in developing countries.
Goldblatt chaired the committee that       defined the minimum product specification (TPP) for the vaccine.
This       report was published in February 2008 [g] and in March 2010,       UNICEF entered into agreements with GSK and Pfizer to supply 30 million       doses annually for 10 years [h].
An independent report into the       AMC process reported that: "Several interviewees praised the TPP for         striking an appropriate balance between setting a high bar to ensure         vaccine effectiveness and still allowing low-cost producers to compete.
The TPP also proved useful in inspiring and supporting similar guidance         for other prospective vaccines" [i].
Since 2010, over 25       countries have begun to roll out pneumococcal vaccines under this       programme; by July 2013, it was estimated that GAVI and its partners have       immunised more than 10 million children [j].
GAVI aims to increase       this to 45 countries by 2015, projecting that this will prevent more than       half a million deaths in this period.
