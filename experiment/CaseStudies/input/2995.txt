     Context: in the UK and other affluent countries efforts to       interrupt and weaken the link between       social disadvantage and educational outcomes have typically been       short-term, fragmented and       under-theorised.
University of Manchester research has generated better       theoretical frameworks,       evidence syntheses and working models, which practitioners and       policy-makers have used to       guide their work.
Pathways to impact: following the approach outlined in REF3a this       case study illustrates an       instrumental change model based on the production and transmission of       evidence, combined with       a constructivist approach to partnerships with and between those who use       and produce evidence.
Specific pathways include: (a) a series of customised `development and         research' programmes, in       which researchers (including embedded doctoral students as `researchers in       residence' in schools,       local authorities and consortia, e.g.
Duggan, Forbes, and Rowley) work       alongside practitioners to       develop and evaluate interventions in practice; (b) engagements with         national and local policy         makers, for instance by evaluating large-scale policy initiatives;       lobbying policy makers (e.g.
Prime       Minister's public services advisor in 2009 and 2010); policy committee and       seminar work (DfE       policy seminars; evidence sessions for the Education Select Committee;       serving on the       Conservative Party public services improvement (education) group in       2006-7); (c) the Centre for         Equity in Education was established to strengthen links between       research, policy and practice, is       led by a `think tank' of senior educationalists who advise on the research       programme, and       publishes a series of widely-distributed annual reports; (d) a planned         programme of dissemination       including presentations at multiple practitioner conferences and the       publication of `accessible'       research syntheses with research-mediating organisations (e.g.
Kerr and       West's commissioned       BERA Insight on Schools and Social Inequality, 2010; Raffo et al's       commissioned Lessons from         the implementation of Area-Based Initiatives for policy and practice       for NESET, 2013).
Engagement with the research by users in schools, local       authorities/consortia, and governments       has been enabled through (a) effective report writing and oral feedback in       ways that have enabled       local and national policy makers to have clear understandings of the       situation and the options       available, and, (b) the use of the reports in meetings with       professionals/stakeholders set up       specifically to examine the evidence and to use it to plan, monitor and       evaluate.
Importantly the       accumulation of evidence through linked projects has enabled partnerships       with users to build on       knowledge in order to develop more sophisticated understandings of good       practice in different       contexts.
So durable partnerships have been built, where project       initiation has shifted from user       requests for one-off projects to more embedded and collaborative       enquiries.
For example, the       Chief Executive of a Housing Trust states that when the Academy opened in       2008: "we established       a long-term development and research (D&amp;R) partnership with the       University of Manchester which       continues to the present.
This aims to inform development of the Academy       by research evidence       and by critical friendship provided by the University" [5.3].
On a       national basis, a civil servant       confirms that an internal report in 2010, the Science and Analysis         Review, identified "that the       Department was able to trace the development of extended services policy,       supported by the       evidence base provided by The School of Education, among other       publications" [5.1].
Reach and Significance of Impacts       We identify impact on practitioners and professional services, and on       public policy and decision-       making in three major sites post 2008:     Local policy and practice: The research reaches practitioners (for       instance, the DfE evidence       review for heads is heavily downloaded, e.g.
472 in October 2011) [5.7],       and schools and LAs have       developed new interventions as a result of engaging with it [5.3, 5.4,       5.6].
Groups of schools have       worked with the Centre for Equity in Education on disadvantage-focused       D&amp;R projects from 2006       onwards, with professional corroboration regarding the direct benefits for       children [5.6].
14 schools       in one LA reviewed and changed their practices, e.g.
by developing better       induction programmes       for newly-arrived students, and shifting from a behaviour-management to a       literacy-support       approach to promoting appropriate student behaviour [3.1].
Two other       schools have engaged from       2008 and 2012 respectively in ongoing D&amp;R projects (including the       sponsorship PhD students -       Rowley and Forbes) to shape their development of substantial community       programmes [5.3, 5.6].
Four LAs have been engaged in D&amp;R projects, one of which supported a       LA-wide `cultural change'       initiative across children's services and included an ESRC CASE       studentship (Duggan) [5.4].
Research has impacted an range of ways:     "...we were able to draw on Dr Rowley's input supported by Professor       Dyson's insights to help and       inform our emerging broader social and community agenda.
The work enabled       us to ensure our       inevitable focus on the school and academic agenda was tempered by helping       us to adhere to our       broader commitment to the wider community" [5.3].
"...as an illustration of how pervasive the impact is I can refer to the       decision being made by the       secondary heads association in (LA name) supported by the LA to instigate       a Borough wide       programme of continuing professional development...
In 2010 (LA name)       developed a similar       challenge and this was supported by Professor Dyson and his team.
Significant improvements       across all indicators have been achieved and Professor Dyson's critical       contribution was a key       factor" [5.4].
Stemming from the commissioned report, Developing Children's Zones         for England (2012), the       Centre for Equity in Education has worked with Save the Children UK       to develop and research       coordinated area interventions to improve disadvantaged children's       outcomes.
Witness statements       confirm the impact of this research strategy, whereby a Chief Executive       from a Housing Trust       states that involvement in Children's Zones means that: "the specific       research, supported by       distillation of knowledge and experience from elsewhere, has helped to       develop a well-rounded       and potentially unique opportunity to have a sustainable and relevant       impact on the lives of       children, their families and the wider economy" [5.3].
The Zones began in       three areas recruited in       2012 and are being rolled out nationally, with proposed `spin-off'       developments in Wales, Scotland       and the English `core cities' [5.5].
The UK Head of Policy at Save the         Children UK, confirms the       impact of research on policy and the decision to launch a national       initiative to develop the zones,       and stresses "the research undertaken by Professor Dyson's team has       clearly shown that efforts to       tackle the link between poverty and poor outcomes for children must work       across family, school       and community contexts and be sustained over time" [5.5].
This initiative       is supported by a coalition       of national organisations [5.5], has attracted attention from Ofsted       [5.12] and is expected to be a       major source of continuing impact.
National policy making: The research reaches policy makers whereby       unsolicited witness       statements have been forwarded to us from BERA regarding Kerr and West's       2010 Insight Report       (see above).
This corroboration confirms the relevance for professionals,       particularly in supporting       discussions [5.8].
The findings of the DfES-funded national evaluation of       Full Service Extended       Schools (FSES) (2003-7) were reported direct to policy makers and provided       an evidence base for       the transformation between 2005 and 2010 of the extended schools agenda to       a policy for all       schools and children's services [5.1, 5.9].
A civil servant outlines the       impact of this research on       national policymaking post 2008: (a) with a shift "from having one       extended school in each local       authority area to focusing attention on the availability of extended       services in every school and       locality"; (b) the link between FSES and attainment meant that "funding       was made available to       schools from 2010 onwards (a subsidy pathfinder) to help them provide a       wide range of activities       for children and young people who were disadvantaged by economic       circumstances, and children       in care"; (c) reports were accessible to the profession "...who were       developing extended services,       particularly head teachers, following the devolution of funding to head       teachers in 2011", and (d)       there were wider impacts, "the evidence collected as part of the research       undertaken by The       School of Education provided key pieces of evidence to inform spending       reviews and policy       development and more recently to inform the recent publication of More         Affordable Childcare" [5.1].
Trans-national policymaking: because the Centre for Equity in       Education focuses on researching       the social determinants of educational disadvantage, Dyson was invited to       chair the early years       and education task groups for the `Marmot Review' of the (similar) social       determinants of health in       England (2010) and in Europe (2011-13) (commissioned by the Department of       Health and World       Health Organisation Europe respectively) [5.2].
Confirmation has been       given that Dyson's role was       based on his research track record, and: "as a further concrete       illustration of the benefits I have       derived from Professor Dyson's research, three quarters of local       authorities in England have       implementation plans based on my Review's recommendations, an important       part of which is       based on Professor Dyson's Task Group report" [5.2].
This work has been       translated directly into       recommendations for policy makers, adopted, for instance, in the EU Health       2020 policy [5.10].
Dyson has also advised the European Commission on its Communication on         Inequalities and         Education (2010-11), and co-wrote the WHO sectoral briefing for       policy makers on the relationship       between health and education (2011) [5.11].
