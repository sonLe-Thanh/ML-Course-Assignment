     Impact in terms of both reach and significance was       designed into the project from the outset.
This       involved the establishment of a Practitioner Panel (PrP) whose       purpose was to test the feasibility       and practicality of risk communication proposals.
The PrP comprised       representatives from more       than twenty public, private and third sector organisations (e.g.
National       Parks, Natural England,       Woodland Trust, Deer Commission for Scotland, Royal Parks, Country Land       and Business       Association, Health Protection Scotland).
The research was also aided by a       Project Advisory Board       (PAB) comprising public health protection, wildlife, visitor and land       management perspectives to       provide expert advice.
Both the PrP and the PAB commented on the research       design, the       interpretation and application of the results.
Engagement with end-user stakeholders included a workshop for animal       health staff at Defra, a       RELU Risk Workshop at York, a Forest Research publication for professional       foresters, a RELU       Policy and Practice Note (27, 2011) `Protecting countryside users         against zoonotic diseases: the         scope for influencing behaviour?'
and a contribution to the Health       Protection Agency Zoonoses         Network Newsletter (11, Jan 2011).
The latter resulted in an       invitation to address the UK Public       Health Network for Zoonoses (UKPHNZ) in June 2011.
The project website is       maintained by the       Forestry Commission (www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/animaldiseaserisks)       to ensure that GPs, countryside       landowners/managers and the public have on-going access to the research       reports, academic       papers and conference presentations.
This includes an `FAQ' section as a       tool for information       dissemination in response to questions received.
The Visitor Safety in the       Countryside Group       (consortium of governmental, NGO, landowning and advisory bodies) has       drawn on our research       to communicate risk management information on LB.
In addition to presentations at national and international scientific       conferences, nine presentations       in 2010 were made to stakeholder groups including the Defra Food and       Farming Group,       landowners/managers, representatives of medical/veterinary organisations,       and delegates to the       annual Health Protection Agency conference.
Presentations were made to the       public at the ESRC       Festival of Social Science and at the National Science and Engineering       Week at Alice Holt Forest.
The practical management actions (detailed below in PrP Evaluation       Survey) were founded in our       multidisciplinary approach, which led to new ways of thinking about and       developing strategies for       communicating about, and managing, zoonotic diseases.
On the       recommendation of the PrP two       conceptual frameworks (Quine et al., 2011) were developed into decision       tools to a) assist       stakeholders' organisations make decisions about how to manage       environmentally acquired risks,       by delineating five categories of organisational response to disease       incidence (i.e., targeted control       of hazard; medical intervention; influencing behaviour; research and       surveillance; lobbying for       action), and b) aid decision-making as to how stakeholders should be part       of this decision-making       process in order to influence behaviour.
One PrP member (i.e., Royal       Parks, Richmond) used the       organisational response framework to structure their responses to zoonotic       threats.
This was       specifically noted in the ESRC Impact Evaluation of the RELU programme       (Meagher, 2012, 18;       22): "Conceptual impacts infiltrated localised or individual thinking....       helping stakeholders to think       through complexity, as with the Royal Parks' use of a project's framework       to help with Lyme       disease risk communication ..... led to a wider appreciation amongst       stakeholders, practitioners       and experts of "the multi-faceted nature of risk communication, and       specifically that the information       deficit model of framing health advice should be challenged", along with       understanding of how to       influence people's behaviour to help manage the issues."
The PrP completed a Practitioner Panel Evaluation Survey to explore their       engagement with, and       evaluation of the benefits of the project (O'Brien et al, 2013).
They identified three key impacts of       the project on their work:             Understanding and thinking.
A better understanding about LB and         how their participation         had changed the way they worked or thought about LB, e.g., by suggesting         opportunities to         influence current practice in the management of zoonoses within their         organisation, to raise         awareness of visitors, schools, and in wildlife ranger training; it         contributed to a public         health approach to LB.
Participation.
Their ability to express their views to others,         learn from others, and make a         positive contribution to the discussions and project.
Methods and issues.
The interdisciplinary mix of methods in the         project enabled them to         take a more holistic approach to their understanding of LB and         facilitated their identification         of key issues surrounding LB.
Guildford Borough Council are implementing a tick awareness campaign on       the high-risk North       Downs, drawing on the behaviour change strategies advocated by our       research which challenge       conventional risk management approaches.
Wellsphere, a US Health       information and support       group have encouraged their members to consult our research findings,       publicly saying "Thank you       David Uzzell, here is hoping that in time this will encourage       organisations to take a proactive       approach to warning the public of the possibilities of tick borne       diseases."
