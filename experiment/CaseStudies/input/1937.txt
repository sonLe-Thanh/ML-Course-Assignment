Specific impact     1.
Major lipids [Research Refs #1 and #2]     Findings: The ERFC reported that lipid assessment can be greatly       simplified by measurement of HDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol without       the need to fast and without regard to triglyceride (Research Ref #1),       with major implications for screening millions of adults.
The same report       demonstrated that measurement of apolipoproteins A and B provides similar       information about CVD risk as does assessment of conventional lipid       fractions.
The ERFC reported that large-scale human biomarker and genetic       evidence is consistent with a causal association of triglyceride-related       pathways in CVD (Research Ref #2).
Impact on guidelines: The ERFC paper on major lipids has been cited       in the 2011 ESC / EAS Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias       [Impact Ref #1: footnote number 42], in the 2012 ESC Guidelines [Impact       Ref #2: footnote number 52], the 2011 American Association of Clinical       Endocrinologists Medical Guidelines [Impact Ref #4: footnote number 359],       and the 2011 AHA Statement on triglycerides and CVD [Impact Ref #5:       footnote number 17].
The ERFC publication on the causal relevance of triglyceride-related       pathways to CVD (Research Ref #2) has been cited in the following       guidelines to support diagnosis and treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia:       the 2012 Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline [Impact Ref #3:       footnote number 9], the 2011 ESC / EAS Guidelines for the management of       dyslipidaemias [Impact Ref #1: footnote number 121], and the 2011 AHA       Statement on triglycerides and CVD [Impact Ref #5: footnote number 98].
2.
Lipoproteins [Research Refs #3 and #4]     Findings: The ERFC reported that lipoprotein(a) is specifically,       continuously and independently associated with CVD in a manner consistent       with causality (Research Ref #3).
The LpPLA2 Studies Collaboration       publication has reported that lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 is       log-linearly associated with risk of CVD (independent of established       lipids), with a similar magnitude of association as for LDL-cholesterol       (Research Ref #4).
Impact on guidelines: The ERFC paper on lipoprotein(a) has been       cited in the following four guidelines to support assessment of Lp(a) in       practice: the 2010 EAS Consensus Panel [Impact Ref #6: footnote number 3],       the 2011 ESC / EAS Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias [Impact       Ref #1: footnote number 49], the 2012 Canadian Cardiovascular Society       Guidelines [Impact Ref #7: footnote number 71], and the 2012 Endocrine       society [Impact Ref #3: footnote number 44], and the 2010 ACCF / AHA       Guidelines [Impact Ref #8: footnote number 102].
The Lp-PLA2 Studies Collaboration publication has been cited the 2011       National Lipid Association expert advice [Impact Ref #9: footnote number       78].
3.
Inflammation biomarkers [Research Ref #5]     Findings: The ERFC reported that assessment of inflammation       biomarkers provides only modest improvement in CVD prediction (Research       Ref #5).
Impact on guidelines: The ERFC paper on inflammation biomarkers has       been cited in the following 2 guidelines: the 2011 ESC / EAS Guidelines       [Impact Ref #2: footnote number 126], the 2012 ESC Guidelines [Impact Ref       #2: footnote number 126], and the 2012 Canadian Cardiovascular Society       Guidelines [Impact Ref #7: footnote number 72].
