     The impact of CFAS on policy, service and society can be seen widely,       e.g.
through citations in policy documents, clinical guidance and the       quoting of findings in public discourse.
Epidemiology of dementia             CFAS provided the core prevalence estimates for dementia in the UK         population in Dementia UK (2007), e.g.
"In terms both of sample size           and scope the evidence base is dominated by the Medical Research           Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study" (page 10, reference         1, section 5).
These estimates remain those used nationally, though they         may in time be modified by Professor Brayne's most recent work which         includes a 20 year intergenerational comparison on prevalence in three         CFAS areas holding methods steady (Matthews et al Lancet.
2013 Jul 17)        The Dementia UK report for the Alzheimer's Society was instrumental         in bringing the weight of CFAS evidence into the 2009 National Dementia         Strategy, e.g.
"Key data for the UK as a whole include the following:           There are approximately 700,000 people with dementia; In just 30           years, the number of people with dementia is expected to double to 1.4           million; The national cost of dementia is about &#163;17 billion per year...",         DoH (2009) Living well with Dementia: A National Dementia Strategy.

See section 5, nos 1 and 2.
The UK End of Life Care Strategy 2008 used our institutional data         which showed Dementia clearly to be a core business of care homes.
See         section 5, no 3.
Increased investment in dementia research.
The 2012 announcement of a         boost to funding for dementia research by the Secretary of State for         Health and the Prime Minister's progress report on his `dementia         challenge' November 2012, quoted the Dementia UK 2007 projected         prevalence figures, (research refs 1 and 3).
See section 5 no 2.
Professional guidelines were influenced by baseline data on the         ageing population over 65, e.g.
Good Practice Guidance for           Commissioning Interventions for people with dementia (DH 2011).
(research refs 1, 3, 4) See section 5, no 11.
Research findings also now underpin practical tools for strategic         planning and commissioning services.
The CFAS prevalence data is the         driver of the 2012 Dementia Prevalence Calculator - a tool for         General Practices and Commissioners to better understand local dementia         prevalence in the community and care homes.
(Research ref 1).
See         section 5, no 10.
Modelling of long term care and costs has made a significant         contribution to the debate around the funding of long term care for the         ageing population (research ref 4).
The clear economic case made for         better supporting dementia patients and carers was picked up by the         Wanless social care review in 2006, ("The MRC CFAS data provides a           detailed breakdown of the level of demand that people with dementia           living outside institutions present to the social care system"         p166.
Section 5, no 4) which fed a debate that continued into the Dilnot         Commission review (2011) and the 2012 White Paper on Social Care.
CFAS has also contributed additional knowledge (e.g.
on risk factors,       disease progression, disability and recovery, depression, and       neuropathology), with the following impacts:             New knowledge identifying the complexity of cognitive decline and         ageing (research refs 2 &amp; 5) raised awareness of the need to better         understand risk, cumulative risk, and vascular risk: e.g.
"mixed           pathology was the most common finding at autopsy in the brains of           older people" (MRC/CFAS) (section 5, no 8) This knowledge had an         important impact on the `pharma' view, influencing prevention work and         clinical trials that thereafter could no longer assume that any one drug         suits all dementia sufferers, and contributing to a new MRC call for a         Fresh Approach to Dementia.. (Section 5, no 8)        Professor Brayne's research has directly influenced a NICE guideline         on dementia.
(CG42: Supporting people with dementia and their carers' in         health and social care) Estimates based on the improved understanding of         neuropathology and dementia drove work for the 2009 NICE Final Appraisal         Determination on donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine for         the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, which led to the amended         guideline.
(NICE technology appraisal guidance 217.
See Section 5, no 9)        CFAS research outcomes are influencing policy beyond the UK, e.g.
findings on dementia sub-types have been incorporated into WHO policy         (Dementia: a public health priority.
WHO and ADI, 2012.
See section 5,         #6, p19), and a 2012 Research Review forming the foundation for         Ireland's developing National Dementia Strategy (see section 5, no 7,         p42).
Public awareness and involvement in research has increased in a very         real sense - in the numbers of `CFAS brains' donated to its Bioresource,         as well as dissemination efforts to increase awareness of brain banking.
BBC News and The Culture Show covered an innovative exhibition in         London, 2011: `Mind Over Matter' was based on portraits and life stories         of donors from the Cambridge longitudinal studies.
The Science Museum's         Dana centre held a parallel debate, with Professor Brayne presenting         aspects of the neuropathological research, on the ethics and practice of         brain donation for research.
