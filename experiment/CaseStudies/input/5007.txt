     Starting in 2003, the KCL research group has been the sole provider of       data to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) on the mental health consequences of       deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan.
KCL researchers demonstrated an       increase in the prevalence of mental health problems, mostly associated       with combat exposure, being a Reservist and cumulative deployment length.
KCL research has shown the importance of adherence to the Harmony       Guidelines in reducing the prevalence of PTSD, psychological distress and       alcohol misuse.
Influencing government policy on mental health care: In May 2011,       the UK Government announced `The Armed Forces Covenant' in which they       stated a moral obligation to provide respect, support and fair treatment       to members of the Armed Forces in return for them "sacrificing some       civilian freedoms, facing danger and, sometimes, suffering serious injury       or death as a result of their duty."
To assess how this was being put into       practice, in December 2011, the House of Commons (HC) Defence Select       Committee published a report on military casualties (1) that uses       information from a number of documents that cite KCL research:            In 2008, the Defence Select Committee published results of an inquiry         into the provision of healthcare for the Armed Forces.
When discussing         PTSD and Reservist mental health problems, the inquiry widely references         KCL research.
A statement within the report from the Royal British         Legion says that "the one issue that the health surveillance being           carried out by King's [KCL] has brought to light is the heavy drinking           culture that exists within the Armed Forces" (2).
In 2010, the MoD published a review of mental health services for         serving personnel and veterans.
This report quoted Fear et al.
2010 when         discussing alcohol abuse.
It also stated the importance of the in-service           mental health strategy rightly concentrating on the length of tours.
Following this report, the Government committed to acting on the         recommendations of the review and announced a dedicated 24-hour           support line for veterans and the provision of 30 additional mental           health nurses to specifically support veterans (3) (see also 5)       Information from the National Audit Office's 2010 report `Treating         Injury and Illness arising on Military Operations' was also included in         the HC Defence Select Committee 2011 report.
In their chapter on mental         healthcare, they cite figures from Hotopf et al, 2006 to highlight           the prevalence of PTSD in deployed personnel (4).
On June 15th 2011, Dr Fear and Prof Wessely were the only       witnesses for the HC Defence Select Committee's hearing on the `Military       Covenant in Action' (1).
Prof Wessely's evidence regarding mental health       disorders led the committee to recommend that "the MoD continue to fund       research into the mental health of those deployed on operations" and that       "the MoD should monitor Armed Forces personnel who have been deployed         on operations to determine if PTSD or other mental health problems       emerge while personnel are still serving."
Dr Fear's reporting on higher       levels of alcohol misuse in the military led the Committee to conclude       that "the MoD has yet to recognise the seriousness of the alcohol         problem and must review its policy in this area."
Additionally, KCL       findings led to the recommendation that the MoD needs to do more to         improve the home coming experiences of Reserves (1).
The MoD responded by accepting the Defence Committee's recommendations       and also the similar themes that emerged from an MP's earlier report (3),       including the necessity of continuing to monitor the impact of deployment       length and time between deployments on mental health, thus enabling the       work of KCL to continue.
Much of the MoD's work regarding screening for PTSD and other mental       illnesses is in concert with KCL researchers and the evidence provided by       KCL with regard to alcohol misuse prompted the MoD to start a review of       its alcohol policy (5).
In 2013, KCL was commissioned by the MoD to       continue their work beyond the end of operations in Afghanistan to monitor       the medium to long term mental health impact on UK Forces.
Impact on providing new mental health programs: A number of       Government-backed or independent organisations have acknowledged the       contribution of KCL research.
Their finding that a single deployment has       an effect on mental health of Reserves directly led to the Reserves Mental       Health Programme in partnership with the NHS (6).
The charity Combat       Stress works with Veterans to deliver effective treatment and support for       mental health problems.
Their 2012 Annual Review cites KCL work when       discussing the prevalence of mental health problems, especially among       Reserves (7).
A letter of testimony from the Chief Executive of Combat       Stress says that KCL studies have "acted as a catalyst for change         across the military mental health sector, including third sector         charities like Combat Stress" (8).
Similarly, a letter of support       from the Director General of the Royal British Legion says that KCL "is a       source of invaluable data and detailed analysis that cannot be obtained       anywhere else and (they have) been of enormous help to the Legion in         the formulation of our policies and successful lobbying campaigns on         issues such as the impact of deployment, marriage and the family and         drug and alcohol misuse" (9).
KCL researchers also featured in a       mental health policy report from the independent think tank Centre for       Social Justice.
When looking at the Armed Forces and mental health they       used both KCL research, such as Fear et al.
2010, and personal testimony       from Prof Wessely to recommended that "the Armed Forces should do more         to reduce alcohol consumption in service personnel" (10).
Influencing tour length and pay structure: In 2011 the UK Armed       Forces reviewed their policy on tour length, partly for financial reasons.
The Chiefs of the Defence Staff and General Staff set up a committee       including the most senior military officers and the Adjutant General, the       three star head of Army Personnel to consider proposals for increasing       tour length from 6 to 9 months.
As KCL work was the only source of UK data       on impact of tour length on mental health, KCL experts gave evidence to       the review process.
KCL figures show that if the rate of breaking of       Harmony Guidelines continued there would be an estimated additional 308       cases of psychological distress and 431 cases of alcohol misuse for each       year of continued operations.
Expressed as population attributable       fractions, adhering to the Harmony Guidelines prevents 7.1% of common       mental illness and PTSD and 7.7% of alcohol problems.
The review accepted       that increases in tour length might have a negative impact on mental       health and may lead to rates of PTSD moving towards the much higher rates       observed in the US, hence the proposals were rejected (11).
KCL research       also influenced the May 2013 announcement by the Secretary of State for       Defence that while to encompass the end of UK combat operations in       Afghanistan in 2014 a small percentage of personnel would be deployed for       8 or 9 months, there would be extra allowances for those deployed for       longer than 6 months, careful management of expectations and only minimal       violation of overall Harmony Guidelines.
KCL research was also used by the MoD when presenting evidence to the       Armed Forces Pay and Remuneration Board on how stress at work should be       taken into consideration when calculating X- factor payments.
These have       been given since the 1970's to recognise the relative disadvantage of       conditions of service experienced by members of the Armed Forces.
The 2008       report discussed how research from KCL demonstrated that "some personnel       returned from operations with psychological problems such as PTSD       particularly when tour lengths exceeded expectations" and how "mental       health problems increased when harmony guidelines were breached."
This evidence         helped lead to the decision to increase X-Factor payments (12).
International impact: When the RAND Arroyo Center were tasked by       the US Department of Defence to review their policy on tour length, KCL       research formed an essential part of the evidence that led to the US         decision to reduce its tour length from 1 year to 9 months.
Personal       testimony from the RAND Corporation says that the findings of the KCL       studies "served a vital role in informing the relationship between       features of deployment such as length of deployment and dwell time" (13).
