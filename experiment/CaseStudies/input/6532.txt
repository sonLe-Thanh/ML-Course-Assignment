     National Significance and Reach     The 2010 HBSC National Report for England achieved notable public       attention, with its launch widely covered in the national media, including       BBC radio, The Sunday Times, Daily Telegraph, and the People.
The Rt Hon Anne Milton MP, minister for Public Health, commented in detail       on the HBSC's clear messages for health services and public health.
Since 2008 the CRIPACC team had been collaborating closely with the       departments of Health and Education to ensure that HBSC formed a key       reference study and that its outputs informed policy and actions in the       area of young people's health and wellbeing.
This resulted in the       following government policies:     1.
Department of Education     `Positive for Youth' was published on 19 December 2011.
Led by the       Department of Education, it represented a new policy for young people,       recommending actions and strategic policy for youth across government       departments and agencies.
The HBSC England findings provided the evidence       base for policy direction and supported the following proposed actions:     i) To counter the negative perspective of youth as `problem': `There         are 4.5 million teenagers in England today.
Despite some widely held         prejudices, most of them are doing well, and over 85% report high life         satisfaction.'
(p. 3)     ii) To highlight the need for action relating to the way computer games       are changing youth leisure: `Rapid development of IT and the internet         is also changing leisure patterns.
For example, the proportion of young         people playing two or more hours of computer games each week increased         between 2006 and 2010 from 42% to 55% for boys, and from 14% to 20% for         girls.'
(p. 5)     iii) To identify new assets that operate to protect young people against       participation in risk behaviours: `One recent study found that         parents' participation in how young people spend their free time, the         connectedness young people feel with their teachers, and the extent to         which they feel safe in their community and have a friendly         neighbourhood, were all protective factors against young people misusing         multiple substances at age 15, and low life satisfaction.'
(p. 32)     iv) To identify ways in which strategies to increase physical activity       rates among young people can be developed and be most effective: `While         young people will be enthused by sport through the School Games they         will also need to be pointed to good and welcoming sport clubs in their         area that can keep their passion for sport burning .
.
.
the Department         for Culture, Media and Sport is tasking Sport England to focus more on         youth, specifically the 14-25 year old age group.
Increasing         opportunities for young people to take part in sport with their friends         may be particularly important for addressing the low levels of physical         activity among girls &#8212; recent research shows that while only 28% of         girls take part in sport with their families at least once a week,         almost 56% do so with their friends.'

Department of Health     HBSC England work directly underpinned Department of Health public health       policy.
We were specifically asked to undertake additional analysis and       provide the DoH with briefing papers in relation to particular areas.
Selected actions arising from our evidence are outlined below:     i) HBSC findings indicated that since 2002 the proportions of all young       people regularly eating breakfast had significantly declined, and girls on       a diet were more likely to skip meals than adopt beneficial behaviours.
The Department's public health team adopted policy to promote healthy       eating and positive weight strategies among girls, and the importance of       eating breakfast for all young people.
ii) Personal and Social Health &amp; Economic (PSHE) education policy:       HBSC findings enabled the Department to identify new developments that       would ensure more effective PSHE education, especially in terms of       responsiveness to young people's needs, age-appropriateness and delivery       by sufficiently expert specialists.
iii) The DoH's communications directorate used HBSC to inform the       development of a new social marketing strategy for youth.
iv) Based on information in the study, the Department identified a new       area of public health intervention: the relationship between online game       playing and young people's health, particularly the connection between       computer-play physical fighting and bullying.
v) HBSC findings have been used by the Public Health subgroup of the       Children and Young People's Outcomes Forum to help generate a series of       robust, evidence-based recommendations for the Children and Young People's       Outcomes Strategy.
International Significance and Reach     WHO     The international HBSC network co-ordinates the publication of       international reports soon after the completion of each national survey,       presenting information on cross-national comparisons.
According to WHO's       HBSC web page (www.euro.who.int/HBSC), the international report `is issued       every four years and is widely used by policy makers and relevant       professionals'.
The report allows national and international policy makers       to compare their own country's position with others in terms of health       behaviours, outcome measures and determinants.
The 2012 report featured       key contributions by the CRIPACC team on family culture (lead author) and       sexual health (co-author).
OECD     HBSC was employed as a reference study by the OECD.
This collaboration       culminated in February 2010 with the England HBSC team working with OECD       to contextualise their recent international project on the Social Outcomes       of Learning Project through presentation of the implications of the HBSC       findings at an international briefing for an audience of policy makers and       researchers.
