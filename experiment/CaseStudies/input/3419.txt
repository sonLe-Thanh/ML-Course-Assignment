     The impact from this research can be considered in three ways:     1).
Direct impact on the Royal Court Theatre in terms of its         practices and approaches to international relations and the development         of new playwriting; by extension this has led to wider knowledge within         the British subsidised theatre sector; indirectly, this has impacted         practitioners, theatres and audiences more widely, thereby diversifying         the cultural landscape.
Interim findings of this research were presented at a seminar hosted         at the Royal Court, `Developing Playwriting Abroad: Translating Cultures         and the work of the International Department' (June 2012).
This event         was chaired by O'Thomas and featured Elyse Dodgson (Royal         Court), Mike Bartlett (playwright) and April De Angelis (playwright) as         key speakers.
This event allowed for a knowledge exchange on translating         cultures between international seminar participants from the theatre         industry.
Thus it demonstrated how HEIs can successfully bridge a gap         between theatres and practitioners in the exchange of working         methodologies and their efficacy.
The Royal Court Theatre highlighted         the benefit of this event for its own external engagement with         translators and for developing a discourse into translation practice.
The brokering of new relationships demonstrates the critical role         universities can have in providing a forum for collaborations which may         endure beyond the scope of the project itself.
Since the publication of         the Interim Report, the British Council in Chile and S&#227;o Paulo has used         its findings to reflect on the curation and development of arts         activities outside the UK.
Meetings with cultural agencies, practitioners and scholars in Morocco         (Le Centre International des Etudes de Spectacle), Brazil (the British         Council) and Chile (the British Council), led to further engagement with         local playwrights and dramaturgs.
The work here was particularly useful         in delineating the role of theatre and new writing to capture political         events (such as the Arab Spring) and how such work becomes mediated         across cultures and languages.
2).
The impact of new plays in production on theatres, audiences, and         more generally on the buoyancy of new playwriting in the UK theatre         landscape:             O'Thomas's work with various schemes (`Connections' at the RNT;         `PIIGS' at the Jerwood Theatre Upstairs at the Royal Court and `Feast'         at the Young Vic) has contributed to a buoyant culture of international         new playwriting, and particularly the work of young playwrights, being         produced in the UK.
This has helped to continue the work of these         theatres and the UK subsidised theatre sector in leading and sustaining         the promotion of diverse, multicultural theatre.
At the same time,         publication of O'Thomas's translated plays consolidates the         archiving of this work for future audiences.
Jordan's work with the staging of Carl Djerassi's plays has         offered public presentation of an important playwright's body of work,         exploring the links between science and theatre.
The impact of this has         not only been on exposing audiences to a significant (new) writer, but         also on inviting dialogue between science and the arts.
Further         production projects with, for example, the Old Vic's `Old Vic, New         Voices' scheme has also introduced other new writing.
The Lincoln School of Performing Arts also operates a new playwriting         and development scheme of its own, `Script This', which runs on a         competitive basis and offers rehearsed readings of selected new plays         submitted from across the country.
3).
The impact of practical understanding gained from this work (as         practice as research), disseminated through scholarly literature:             O'Thomas's critical understanding of translation and adaptation         has been widely disseminated at conferences and in publications (O'Thomas         2010, 2012), contributing to an understanding of emerging trends in new         translation methodologies, which are feeding into pedagogic practices in         the field.
Jordan's dissemination of his working collaboration with         Djerassi (Jordan 2012) has also outlined interesting working         methodologies involved in the `translation' from text to performance of         complex scientific concepts and terminology.
His voice in the emergent         critical discussion about Science in Theatre is prominent, and reflected         in a forthcoming publication and a conference organised for 2014 which         will combine academic audiences with a wider public.
