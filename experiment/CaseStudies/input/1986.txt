     AUNT-SUE exhibition posters and supporting materials (e.g.
flyers, report       summaries) were shown at consecutive events such as the Inclusive Design       conference (INCLUDE 2005/7/9), OS Terra Futures       conference/exhibition and in practitioner fora overseas - Joburg, S.Africa       (city planning/ transport/crime prevention); New Orleans, USA (crime       prevention); Montreal, Canada (ageing/ gerontology).
A further EPSRC/Arts       Council award Sustainability and the 24-hour City: A Collaboration         with the Creative Arts (Shaw, Evans) funded two practising artists       who were engaged to interpret and exhibit our research results and       visualise test bed localities, data/findings and images.
Week long       exhibitions at the London Festival of Architecture (LFA), including       visitor questionnaires and presentations were held at the German       Gymnasium, King's Cross/St Pancras (16-25 June 2006) with a follow-on       exhibition and presentation of this work at the North Country       conference/exhibition held at the URBIS Centre, Manchester in April 2007.
A further exhibition of findings and toolkit was held at the biannual       London Festival of Architecture (LFA) in June 2008, at the Building       Centre, London.
Attendances at these high profile events (national TV,       extensive local/city and professional coverage) were 25,000 and 75,000       respectively with research and community workshops organised and held with       local authority chief planners, councillors and ministers/shadow       ministers, as well as local communities and firms.
In order to disseminate the project more widely, an AUNT-SUE video was       produced by the research team with the assistance of a Digital Media MA       student and tutor.
The video features PI/Co-PI, researchers, partner       organisations and vox pop interviews and street walks within one of the       test bed sites (LB Camden).
This video was available via the AUNT-SUE       website (www.aunt-sue.info) including sub-titles where needed and was       distributed at events in DVD format which are also available on request       (500 distributed to date).
It is now available on YouTube.
The film was       premiered at the Building Centre LFA event (above), and is regularly shown       at conferences, exhibitions and was shown at the Transport Museum cinema       following the Final Symposium event, attended by 75 representatives from       the transport industry, local/central government, press, as well academics       and the research team.
The final symposium also saw the re-launch of the       AUNT-SUE website, the prime dissemination and communication vehicle -       newly designed and `populated' - including the full suite of menu-driven       toolkits, publications and other outputs, including case studies, reports       and related user guides and project video, with over 4,500 `hits' on this       site recorded between January and April 2010 (the site went offline in       early 2013 due to unforeseen technical issues, which are currently being       addressed).
Further evidence of impact and take-up of research outputs include the       following examples:            AUNT-SUE GIS-based urban environment and audit tool incorporated into         Transport for London's (TfL) Guidance for Submissions of Local           Accessibility Schemes, prepared for all London Boroughs and         sub-regional partnerships (March 2007).
This was the requisite guidance         for all local authorities in their bids to TfL for accessibility         improvement capital funding.
EPSRC People &amp; Systems review (January 2009) - the international         reviewers assessment of transport projects including the AUNT-SUE         exhibition and supporting materials (Poster Number 58), noted that         'there was good connectivity to users and stakeholders' and in the case         of more applied projects such as AUNT-SUE, `high impact on the user         community'.
AUNT-SUE research findings and tools included in successive         Parliamentary annual reports Research and development work relating           to assistive technology, 2010-11 and 2008-9, Department of Health       AUNT-SUE consulted on and presented research findings and urban         environment tools (Evans &amp; Shaw) to PM Cabinet Office Strategy Unit,         for joint publication An analysis of urban transport (November         2009) with Departments for Transport, Health, Communities &amp; Local         Government (CLG) and DEFRA.
Although the research was not directly         referenced in the report, the authors adopt the `inclusive whole journey         environment' theme as defined by Evans &amp; Azmin-Fouladi.
AUNT-SUE consulted on and presented findings/recommendations (Evans)         on Indicators/ Metrics for sustainable travel, impacts on quality of         life and land use/transport interaction, to Chief Scientific Adviser's         Unit, Department for Transport (April 2010 pre-General Election).
Initial work on transport and social exclusion was recently included in         departmental report Valuing the social impacts of public transport         (2013).
