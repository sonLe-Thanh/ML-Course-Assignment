     Impact: The underpinning research was exploited in the development       of an innovative Worst-Case Execution time (WCET) analysis technology now       called "RapiTime".
This technology was transferred to industry via the       formation in 2004 of a successful spin-out company; Rapita Systems Ltd.
This technology has been deployed on, and is in continuous use on, a       number of major long-term aerospace and automotive projects world-wide,       examples include:            [text removed for publication]: Flight Control Computer (FCC) and the         [text removed for publication] (RapiTime in continuous use since 2006)         [11].

The majority of Rapita's revenues come from products and       services based on RapiTime.
Route to Impact: Above we detailed specific exploitation of the       technology and impact and during the REF period.
Next we detail the       evidential link between the underpinning research and that impact.
During       the EU FP5 NextTTA project members of the RTSRG group, Guillem Bernat,       Antoine Colin, Stefan Petters, and Alan Burns, introduced the underpinning       research on hybrid measurement-based WCET analysis.
This approach combined       both measurement and static analysis techniques to accurately estimate the       WCET of complex software components running on advanced microprocessors.
As part of the project, they also developed a prototype WCET analysis tool       called pWCET [5].
This tool was evaluated on an Audi drive-by-wire system.
Audi was an industrial partner in the NextTTA project.
Audi's expression       of interest in pWCET and its capabilities led directly to the formation of       a spin-out company to transfer this technology into industry.
In 2004, members of the RTSRG; Guillem Bernat, Ian Broster, Antoine       Colin, and Robert Davis, and the University of York founded a spin-out       company called Rapita Systems Ltd. (www.rapitasystems.com)       to commercialise the technology and bring it to market.
All rights to the       technology and prototype tools were transferred to the company by the       University of York which became a shareholder in the company.
In 2005, Rapita Systems received &#163;200k of funding from Viking Investments       Ltd. and an associated group of Business Angels [6].
Following the initial       technology transfer, the pWCET prototype was re-implemented as a       commercial quality tool and re-branded as RapiTime.
RapiTime has since       been extended to support analysis of systems written in C++ as well as the       C, and Ada programming languages, and has recently been complemented by a       Code Coverage tool (RapiCover) which uses the underpinning RapiTime       technology for code instrumentation and analysis.
Together, RapiTime and       RapiCover are part of the Rapita Verification Suite (RVS).
In 2006, BAE Systems used RapiTime on the Hawk Advanced Jet Trainer       project [7].
Here, RapiTime was used to identify opportunities for WCET       reduction, thus creating headroom for new functionality to be added to the       system, while avoiding the need for a costly hardware upgrade.
Using       RapiTime, BAE identified that just 1% of hundreds of thousands of lines of       code contributed 29% of the overall WCET.
Further, by focusing       optimisation efforts on this 1% of the code, they were able to reduce the       WCET by 23% [8].
Further, RapiTime was quantified as being able to       identify timing problems with less than 10% of the effort of previous       approaches, potentially saving months of work.
As a result Rapita received       a BAE chairman's award for Innovation in the category Transferring Best       Practice.
Since 2008, Rapita has focused on sales of its RVS product, centred on       RapiTime, to customers in the aerospace and automotive markets.
This       impact has been described in the previous section.
The RTSRG at the University of York continues to have strong links with       Rapita; Prof. Alan Burns is chairman of the Board, while Dr. Robert Davis       is a Non-Executive Director of the company and also a member of the RTSRG.
Beneficiaries: RapiTime enables companies in the aerospace and       automotive electronics industries to reduce the time and cost required to       obtain confidence in the timing correctness of the systems they develop.
It provides a cost-effective means of targeting software optimisation,       such that new functionality can be added to existing systems without the       need for expensive hardware upgrades.
Further, RapiTime is portable across       a wide range of different microprocessors, meaning that companies can use       the same technology across multiple projects without the need for       re-training or adoption of multiple solutions.
[text removed for publication], the major [text removed for publication]       aerospace supplier, described the benefits of using RapiTime to identify       timing problems during continued development of the Flight Control System       for the [text removed for publication] as follows: "The biggest         benefit that RapiTime brought to our development process was just how         quickly we could get comprehensive timing measurements from our tests.
Not only did we reduce our effort requirements for the testing, but we         could use our results in ways that were infeasible before.
It is now         significantly faster for us to identify a timing issue, update the         software to resolve the issue, test the updated software and verify that         it's fixed" &#8212; Wayne King, Engineering Fellow, [text removed for       publication] &#8212; 30th July 2009 [9].
Without RapiTime, the timing measurement and analysis process needed to       determine WCETs has to be done manually.
This is a painstaking and error       prone process that takes considerable time and effort.
It also needs to be       repeated when changes are made to the application software.
Further, the       manual process provides no information about the worst-case path, or the       contribution of different sections of code to the WCET.
This makes code       optimisation an ad-hoc, ineffective and inefficient process, as optimising       for the worst-case is very different from optimising for the average case.
Alenia Aermacchi engineers working on the M-346 Flight Control System       said, "the main advantage [of using RapiTime] is the possibility to         identify software bottlenecks that can be subject to optimisation.
Without RapiTime the mandatory code optimisation would have been done         without the knowledge of where to concentrate the efforts."
[10].
Overall, "Using RVS, customers have cut the worst-case execution time         of large scale, legacy applications by up to 50% with only a few days         effort, and significantly reduced unnecessary testing and         instrumentation overheads" [11].
Rapita has offices in York and opened a second office in Cambridge in May       2012.
Rapita has created and sustained [text removed for publication] high       technology jobs [9].
The success and indeed the existence of the company       is a consequence of the underpinning research as described in the       narrative.
Corroboration of all of the facts presented above about Rapita and its       customers etc.
