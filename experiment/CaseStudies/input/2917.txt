     Context       The MSC was one of the busiest waterways in Europe during the industrial       revolution.
It was       polluted by industrial discharges, sewage overflows, surface water runoff       and tributaries.
Salmon       disappeared from the Irwell in the 1850s and rowing races were abandoned       in the 1970s.
Despite       the real estate value of the disused docks being estimated at around       &#163;500m, development was       prevented by unpleasant odours, bubbling gas and sediment rafts.
Pathways to impact       White's research into water pollution and biodiversity has been translated       into practical solutions       for the remediation of contaminated urban waterways.
The mechanism for       this quick and effective       translation is an on-going collaboration with the spin-out company, APEM       (Aquatic Pollution and       Environmental Monitoring).
APEM was founded at UoM in 1987 by White's       former Research       Associate, Hendry [A].
The annual turnover of APEM is ~&#163;8m, making it one       of the largest       independent aquatic science consultancies in Europe [B].
White is a       Director and Scientist at the       company [A].
APEM was commissioned to monitor, manage and advise on water quality and       ecology in Salford       Quays and the MSC.
The work started in 1987 and is continuing to have a       major impact on the       area today (see review in [3]) with critical input from UoM researchers.
Reach and significance of the impact       Providing an evidence base for effective water remediation           strategies:       APEM's continuing commercial activities relating to water quality       management are underpinned by       research led by White.
From 1993 to date, research conducted by White has       been influential in       directing APEM's research strategy and enabling the realisation of       environmental and social       benefits, with joint projects and co-supervised students playing a key       role.
Specific examples are       as follows:            Bellamy, under the supervision of White, showed that `top down'         control by planktonic and         benthic biota are key factors in improving water quality in Salford         Quays by filtering out algae         [5], and this research was taken forward by APEM.
The improvements         resulted in the         introduction of a successful recreational fishery.
Salford Friendly         Angling Society, with over 300         members, is currently bidding for the fishing rights.
White supervised Nash, whose research on the role of water quality in         determining coarse fish         population dynamics was published as a report to the Environment Agency,         Mersey Basin         Campaign and United Utilities [C].
Nash showed that water quality in the         lower River Irwell and         upper MSC had profound effects on the size and health of fish stocks.
An industrial placement student, Whitehead (Sep 2012 - Aug 2013) has         produced valuable         results examining metal contamination in fish populations.
This data has         been used by APEM to         assess the level trace metal contamination in the lower River Irwell and         MSC.
Mansfield is currently working with APEM to examine past data         collected by the company that         have identified, quantified and modelled the key drivers (`bottom-up'         control via the nutrient         phosphate and `top-down' control via filtration) of the changing aquatic         community structure in         Salford Quays, and has provided insights into the reasons for the         current favourable water         quality and ecology.
These findings will be used by APEM and others to         inform water quality         and ecological management of similar artificial and re-engineered         systems.
The long and productive collaboration between APEM and White is       demonstrated by APEM having       sponsored/directly funded five PhD students and co-supervised over 20 MSc       projects [B].
APEM       hosts up to two industrial placement students per year from UoM, where       students are paid a salary       and act as members of staff for 12 months.
The Chairman of the Mersey Basin Campaign states, "We can verify that         the solutions pioneered         by researchers at APEM and the University of Manchester have actively         led to significant         improvements in water quality at Salford Quays and the ecological         recovery of the area" [D].
The Assistant Director of Planning at Salford City Council also verifies       that, "The research         conducted by APEM and the University of Manchester which produced         practical solutions... has       been fundamental to the area's success" [E].
Environmental improvements:       The initial Water Quarter Improvement Programme (WQIP, 1987) involved       cleaning the       headwaters of the MSC and was funded by North West Water (&#163;3.5m) and       English Partnerships       (&#163;0.5m), with input from the Mersey Basin Campaign, United Utilities, MG       Gases and APEM [F].
A       key part of the WQIP involved injecting oxygen into the MSC and monitoring       resulting water quality       improvements.
In 2012 this was replaced with Helixor mixers (following       success in Salford Quays)       and APEM was commissioned to assess their efficacy in maintaining water       quality improvements.
This system is now being extended to the whole 33km MSC [B].
As a result of the WQIP, a thriving fish and invertebrate community       developed and 22km of the       MSC has been designated a cyprinid fishery under the Freshwater Fisheries       Directive (FFD)       (78/659/EEC).
At one point, the dock basins contained the fastest growing       fish population in the       UK [B].
Work is on-going to achieve FFD standards further along the MSC.
Oxygen levels at Salford Quays are now sufficient to meet the European       Water Framework       Directive [D].
Economic and commercial impact on Salford Quays:       The cleaner waterways have been absolutely critical in attracting &#163;185m of       public investment in the       Salford Quays area, levering &#163;1,405m of private investment [E].
This       includes &#163;7m from United       Utilities, over &#163;1m from Salford City Council, &#163;400k from the Heritage       Lottery Fund and &#163;100k from       the Mersey Basin Campaign [B].
As a result of the water quality       improvements, homes for 6,000       people have been built and 900 businesses have located on Salford Quays,       employing over       35,000 people (in contrast to the 1,000 people employed 20 years ago) [E].
From being a polluted wasteland, Salford Quays is now a hub of culture,       retail and tourism.
It hosts       attractions such as the Lowry Theatre, the Imperial War Museum and the       Salford Watersports       Centre that hosted the 2002 Commonwealth Games Triathlon [B].
MediaCityUK has recently been developed on Salford Quays and the       projected public and private       investment is approximately &#163;800m for 2005-2020 [F].
MediaCityUK is       designed around the       specific needs of the media and creative industries and from Spring 2012       is home to the BBC, ITV,       University of Salford, Lowry Outlet Shopping and over 80 small businesses.
Phase One of       MediaCityUK is a 36-acre site, including 65,032 2       office space, 7,432 2 of retail and leisure       space, 378 apartments, a new tram terminus and a public area for 5,000       people [G].
Social and cultural impact:       The rejuvenation of the MSC and Salford Quays has provided a high quality       and pleasant living       environment for residents and recreational facilities for the community.
Indeed, Salford Quays       attracts well over 3million visitors per year [E].
European `Blue Flag' standards of water purity have been recorded at       Salford Quays, allowing       international sports events such as triathlons to take place [B].
From       2010 to date, the site hosts       the annual Great Manchester Swim event which is part of the `Great Swim'       open water swim       series) [H].
Also, the Water Sports Centre at Salford Quays is a well-used       facility and a base for       Agecroft Rowing Club which includes Olympic rowers [E].
Neighbouring socially deprived areas such as Ordsall, Langworthy and       Trafford Park benefit from       substantially increased levels of investment in the Salford Quays area       [F].
Informing other regeneration programmes:       The successful regeneration of the waterways at Salford Quays has been       mirrored on the Trafford       bank of the MSC, which encompasses the football and cricket grounds of Old       Trafford, which are       now a distinct part of Greater Manchester.
Salford City Council       acknowledges that, `APEM and the         University of Manchester's role ... has been vital' [E].
It is hoped that the water remediation strategy at Salford Quays and the       upper MSC will be applied       to the whole 33km length of the MSC in 2015, to facilitate compliance with       the Water Framework       Directive [B,D].
Furthermore, the results from the Salford Quays and the MSC projects have       set the precedent for       the regeneration and redevelopment of other dock and urban waterways,       including London       Docklands, Liverpool Docks and Cardiff Bay [B].
