     Sophisticated computer simulations are used in many sectors of industry       to reduce the high cost of       prototyping and experiment and to provide better answers to complex       problems in less time.
Research conducted as part of the Geodise project led to the development       of tools and       technologies which were accessible over the web "on-demand" (cloud         computing) to make       engineering designs faster, cheaper, greener, better.
We commercialised       this work through       Dezineforce, whose products and services were tested and used by design       engineers to optimise       designs in a range of industries including aerospace and defence, energy,       civil engineering and       automotive.
In Civil Engineering Arup used the dezineforce tools in 2008/9 to       design a spectator cooling       system in a 65 000-seater sports stadium in the Middle East.
Using       Dezineforce's service, Arup       reduced the number of design iterations by over 80 percent and saved       valuable time and a       &#163;1million+ figure sum for the stadium owners.
Darren Woolf, Associate       Director of Arup's       Environmental Physics team who led the analysis explained the benefits [5.1]:     "Because CFD is so computationally hungry, each one of our design         iterations could take up to         eight hours to run on eight computers working in parallel.
It would have         needed, using traditional         direct search techniques, as many as 300 design iterations per scenario.
A key objective for us         was to reduce this number of design iterations needed to reach a         solution.
Dezineforce's         optimisation technology enabled us to evolve an optimum design faster         than other algorithms out         there and we saw the number of runs required drop by more than 80         percent from what we were         predicting."
... "There is no question that engineering design         optimisation is complex and         processor hungry but, implemented correctly with well-designed         processes, such as those from         Dezineforce, coupled with high performance processing resources, it can         be a very powerful         tool."
Other work included optimisation of wind farm layout with UK company         Intelligent Fluid Solutions       in 2009 [5.2], where efficient use of optimisation-driven       simulation enabled the optimum number       and layout of wind turbines for a specific site to be identified.
This       resulted in a predicted increased       lifetime return of over &#8364;55 million compared to the same number of       turbines in an alternative       arrangement.
Dr Andrej Horvat, Principal Engineer, Intelligent Flow       Solutions presented his       conclusions of joint study using Dezineforce cloud and optimisation       technologies:     "A CFD based modelling methodology was developed to predict wind farm         power output for a         given investment.
Different wind farm layouts were simulated to         calculate power output of the         wind farm; The analysis shows that the same number of turbines in         different layouts can result in         significantly different yield.
With alternate offset rows, wide, shallow         wind farms are most         profitable; the use of computational simulation methods and advanced         optimisation tools can         result in significant performance improvements."
Dezineforce also worked closely to have an impact with leading suppliers       of modelling tools in the       industry to bring new ways to access licenses and HPC tools to customers.
Previously companies       sold only expensive licenses whereas working with Dezineforce, software       companies such as       ANSYS, CD-Adapco, and MSc-Nastran realised that many clients want to rent       their software by the       hour or for a specific project.
In particular, partnership with       Dezineforce companies such as Ansys       developed new pricing structures &amp; models for license usage amenable       to HPC and engineering       design search tasks.
Dezineforce was one of the first companies to offer       these packages in this       flexible way over the cloud or on site.
Barbara Hutchings, Director of       Strategic Partnerships at       ANSYS Limited and Lionel Humpheys (sales manager) commented in       April 2010 on these       changes to licensing with Dezineforce during at a webcast (quote from       Q&amp;A): [5.3]     "The [Dezineforce] HPC Appliance is designed to work with ANSYS         Mechanical, ANSYS CFX,         and ANSYS Fluent.
If you happen to own parallel licenses of these         products, all of these could be         traded back at 100% of their original list prices, and we will trade         them back for HPC licenses.
In         certain instances, it may mean you get an increase of license count &#8212; an         increase in the number         of parallel sessions you can run at no additional cost."
Microsoft has engaged heavily with the University of Southampton       and Dezineforce.
Vince       Mendillo [5.4], Senior Director of High Performance Computing at       Microsoft (in Nov 2009)       commented:     "Windows HPC server is enabling scientists and engineers around the         world to tackle challenging         research problems.
We are very excited about the tremendous work the         team at the University of         Southampton has been doing to bringing supercomputing to the masses."
At Supercomputing in Nov 2010, Dezineforce and the University of       Southampton, using Microsoft       Windows HPC Server R2, Microsoft Azure, and the Dezineforce technical       computing server,       showed how an engineer can seamlessly scale their complex design analysis       from their client       workstation, to a local cluster, and then onto an Azure cloud based       platform [5.5].
This was the first       demonstration of such a capability on Microsoft's technology using       in-house HPC systems, cloud       computing and running licensed 3rd party software coupled to       optimisation tools.
Microsoft worked       closely with the team in Dezineforce and it was one of the first UK       companies recognised as part of       its BizSpark One programme (2010) [5.6] and Dezineforce's IP was       sold to Microsoft in 2011 with       transfer of 6 staff to key roles in its Azure (Cloud)/ senior team.
For more than a decade, the partnership between the University of       Southampton and Microsoft has       continued to impact on Microsoft's global business proposition and has       received funding of over       &#163;1 million from Microsoft in the last 5 years alone.
Cox has been awarded       Microsoft Most Valuable       Professional (MVP) status every year since 2003 [5.7].
In 2010 Cox       was appointed, along with       Southampton's Dr Kenji Takeda, as a founder member of Microsoft's       Technical Computing       Executive Advisory Council, which includes CIOs of Fortune 20 companies.
Takeda has since       joined Microsoft as Solutions Architect and Technical Manager in its       research team (from 2010).
Outreach.
The University of Southampton continues to inspire the       next generation of scientists       and engineers &#8212; especially relating to the use of high performance/ cloud       computing.
Cox's       "Supercomputing in Engineering" course [5.8] with the Smallpeice         Trust has run annually with       25+ sixth form students since 2006 with a content rating of 90%+ from       participants with comments       such as "Day two on the course kicked off with Simon's talk on         algorithms and efficiency in         supercomputer.
I loved this talk because it summed up everything I was         interested in computers".
Lucy Kelly (Smallpeice Trust) commented in 2013 "This course has         demonstrated to some very         intelligent and enthusiastic young people just how important this         subject is and what a great impact         they could have if they decided to pursue a career in this area."
Over 485,000 [Oct 2013] people have viewed Cox's YouTube video [5.9]       showing how the       Raspberry Pi will enable the next wave of cheap commodity cloud/       supercomputing with news       articles, video material and a full construction guide about the World's       first Raspberry Pi + Lego         Supercomputer: 300+ worldwide news/ tech press items in multiple       languages including BBC,       CNET, PC Pro Magazine (where it was the #1 Raspberry Pi project in their       Christmas 2012       edition), and 10,000+ Tweets &amp; Facebook likes of the news coverage.
Liz Upton [5.10] [liz@raspberrypi.org]; the only paid employee of       the Raspberry Pi Foundation at       the time of writing her mail, who handles all of their external       public-facing interactions wrote to Cox       on 12/09/12 about the story above:     "Thank *you* &#8212; we were tickled to bits when we saw it.
Do give me a         shout next time you do         something Pi-related; I'm always looking for stuff for the blog, and I         have suspicion you're not         done yet!"
Such outreach is contributing towards ensuring there is a pool of highly       skilled workers who will       pioneer the next wave of research and development into computational       technologies for       engineering just as we have done through Dezineforce and its underpinning       research.
Cloud computing as exemplified by its penetration into consumer products       such as music, photos,       personal archiving and business products for office document and data       sharing has fundamentally       changed the way we use computing power and it touches many lives.
Its       application to Engineering       problems was pioneered at the University of Southampton.
