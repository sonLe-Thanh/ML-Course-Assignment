Changing how Mozilla think about the Internet: [1][1a][1b]     Rogers' research has impacted on the Mozilla Foundation in the       development of a new core strategy to include physically made things as       well as software.
This created a change in audience reach and depth,       evidenced through "Making The Web Physical" at the Mozilla Festival       2013.
A further impact has been the re-connecting of Mozilla Japan,       leading to new projects and an alignment in international programmes.
Rogers' RCUK funded Bespoke and Interactive Newsprint projects led to       Mozilla Foundation contacting Rogers in 2011.
Rogers delivered workshops,       hack-events and exhibitions with Mozilla Foundation, from May 2011,       including their largest public facing event, the Mozilla Festival,       with 1,000 participants from over 40 countries.
Period of Impact:       2011-2013     "Outcomes of this include a core strategy to convene people who         physically make things to people who code things.
And in the case of our         open news program, we are looking closer at news beyond the screen and         revisiting the role of paper and physical objects.
Dr. Rogers'         collaboration with our partner organization, Mozilla Japan, helped         rekindle our own relationship with our colleagues, by discovering new         projects we can work on together and helping to align our programs."

Changing the way NASA approaches open data: [2][2a][2b][2c]     Rogers contributed to the Open NASA programme building a new form       of collaboration, the `Space Apps Challenge', which lead to 9,000       people worldwide in over 80 countries, and the International Space       Station, collaboratively working on open challenges.
Rogers presented with       NASA at the `South By South West Festival', Austin, USA, to an       audience of 30,621 from 57 countries.
Drawn from Physical App       research on the Bespoke project, Rogers set a series of challenges calling       for this worldwide community to build physical responses to open data.
This resulted in a large-scale transformation of the way Open NASA       approached innovation.
Transforming a community centred on screen-based       data interactions with scientists and engineers, to a community that       included artists, designers and craft practitioners.
Rogers' work has lead       to a shift in the culture of collaboration and provided leadership in new       directions for NASA's Open Data collaborations.
Period of Impact:       2012-2013     "Rogers directly challenged 9,000 developers, designers and         entrepreneurs worldwide to build physical applications using open data         with the purpose of improving life on Earth and in space.
These         challenges were based on his research in making the internet and data         physical and resulted not only in the development of 125 valuable         applications but also in shifting the way the team I lead at NASA         approaches open innovation."

Developing the V&amp;A's approach to the exhibition of digital work         by showcasing collaborative making as well as finished product: [3]     Rogers' work with the V&amp;A started with the exhibition of the Bespoke       project in September 2011.
Collaborating with the curator Irini       Papadimitriou, a number of events were developed under the banners of Digital         Futures and Digital Weekend, which attracted over 16,000       visitors to the world's first Climate Change and Fashion Hackathon       in 2013.
This has directly led to the Met Office and the V&amp;A working       collaboratively on future research and thinking that explores the cultural       relevance of climate change.
This is the first time since the two       institutions were formed in the 1900s that these institutions have worked       together.
Period of Impact: 2011-2013.
"Rogers' work with the V&amp;A started with the showcase of the         Bespoke project in September 2011.
After this successful event, we         started our collaboration and a number of events were developed under         the banners of Digital Futures and Digital Design Weekend, which         attracted over 16,000 visitors to the world's first Climate Change and         Fashion Hackathon in 2013.
The events explored digital media and         scientific knowledge at the interface between art, science and design.
This has directly lead to the Met Office and the V&amp;A working         collaboratively on future research and thinking that explores the         cultural relevance of climate change.

Product development within an SME, Uniform: [4][4a][4b][4c]     Rogers research influenced the UK design agency, Uniform to develop new       products related to making the digital economy physical.
The company       developed printed electronics for new forms of printed communication       resulting in Uniform being nominated for the Design Museum's Design Of         The Year 2013 Award for the work on Postcard Player.
This increased       their commercial reach by attracting new clients.
Period of impact: 2011-2013.
"Rogers' research exploring the viability of printed electronics for         new forms of printed communication underpinned the development of         Uniform's Listening Post and Postcard Player prototypes which have been         exhibited in: The Victoria and Albert Museum, London; SXSW, Austin         Texas; Future Everything, Manchester; and the London Design Festival.
Notably, the Postcard Player was nominated for the Design Museum's         Design Of The Year 2013 Award, a peer reviewed award recognising the         world's best design.
As a result of projects completed to date the         company has won and retained a number of key accounts, including         Bacardi, The FA and Glen Dimplex and garnered international press         attention and critical acclaim from journals such as Wired, Creative         Review, The Wall Street Journal and The BBC.
