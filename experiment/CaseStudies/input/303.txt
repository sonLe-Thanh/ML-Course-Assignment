     A major point of impact for UCLan historical research has been in       underpinning the scholarly       credentials of both the People's History Museum and the Co-operative       College in very significant       re-developments at both organisations in recent years.
The PHM's &#163;13m       project (completed in       2010) attracted &#163;7.5m from the Heritage Lottery Fund, &#163;2m from the North       West Development       Agency, &#163;2m from Manchester City Council, &#163;400,000 from European       Development Fund,       &#163;350,000 from Allied London plc and &#163;180,000 from the Wolfson Foundation.
These developments       resulted in new galleries of 1,600 square metres, consisting of 38 themes       on working class social       and political history since 1800.
The PHM was awarded a further &#163;200,000       by the Department of       Culture, Media and Sport in 2010 to undertake research and development       work on the proposed       Museum Centre for British History.
Mansfield, Stewart and Meredith       contributed academic support       for this project resulting in a feasibility report for government       ministers.
The Co-operative College's       &#163;2.3m project (completed in 2012) divided into &#163;1.6m on the Rochdale       Pioneers Museum and       &#163;700,000 on outreach projects at the Museum and the National Co-operative       Archives, attracted       &#163;1.5m from the HLF and grants from the John Paul Getty and Esm&#233;e Fairburn       Foundations and       other funders.
A key factor in helping these institutions to secure large       scale funding in competitive       environments was the strength of the academic relationships they had       forged with UCLan       historians.
It was recognised that a close connection with academic       historians would enhance the       quality and depth of the displays and outreach work that these       developments would supply.
Thus,       although the direct beneficiaries were the organisations themselves, it       was as a means for making       for more significant reach.
The research, advice and expertise of UCLan staff contributed generally       and directly to several       specific exhibitions and displays.
The broad themes of the underpinning       research by Stewart,       Meredith and Mansfield contributed to core thinking in the re-design of       PHM, and to the       arrangement of specific galleries, for example that on post-war       developments, 1945-79.
Stewart       and Mansfield, together with Walton, provided academic underpinning for       the PHM exhibition       Battle for the Ballot - the struggle for the vote in Britain,       which opened in April 2008.
They also       contributed to the PHM's guidebook, Battle for the Ballot, (2008.)
Stewart's research on the       importance of posters within the Labour Party and the political values of       the Co-operative       movement, together with Mansfield's on banners (and that of his       post-graduate student Chris       Burgess) contributed to the 2011 - 12 PHM exhibition Picturing         Politics.
McAllister's research on       the temperance movement, supported by a grant from the Heritage Lottery       Fund, contributed       directly to the creation of the PHM's exhibition, and extensive programme       of related events,       Demon Drink, running from June 2012 to February 2013.
This       project encompassed a wide range       of activities, including material and virtual exhibitions, making archives       more accessible,       developing materials for schools and even attracted the interest of       organisations working with       alcohol abusers, looking into historical and cultural vehicles to       rehabilitation.
These activities are designed to benefit visitors to the museums, to       extend and deepen their       understanding and appreciation of the labour and co-operative movements.
PHM attracts c.85,000       visitors pa (13% are from C2DE socioeconomic groups and 8% from the BME       communities) with a       total yearly economic impact of &#163;8.5m.
The recently re-opened Rochdale       Pioneers Museum is       expected to attract 10,000 users a year.
Visitor comments and evidence       from social media       websites indicate that the revised galleries are interesting and       thought-provoking.
UCLan historians have utilised the findings of their research to inform       over one hundred gallery       talks and public lectures and events at UCLan, the PHM and CC, and       featured on national media       outlets, reaching audiences numbered in millions, including Meredith in BOOKtalk       on BBC       Parliament, Stewart on Beyond Westminster on BBC Radio 4, and       Mansfield on Wartime Farm on       BBC2.
Meredith and Stewart co-organised a `Witness panel' at the PHM to       mark the centenary of       James Callaghan, which brought together their research expertise with       contemporaries, journalists       and family in a combined academic and non-academic exploration.
Conferences and workshops       have also been aimed at professionals (curators, archivists and       librarians) and co-operative       practitioners.
Examples include Co-operatives &#8212; moving from the         Rochdale Pioneers to the 21st       Century, 2009 (papers published by UNUP in 2011) and Mainstreaming         Co-operation, 2012       (supported by the United Nations as part of the UN Year of Co-operatives).
