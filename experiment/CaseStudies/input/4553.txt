     Myotonic Dystrophy is the most common muscular dystrophy in adults       affecting around 1/8000 individuals.
It is also by far the most variable       neuromuscular disorder in terms of severity, age at onset and different       body systems affected.
In addition to the health-related issues in DM1       there is a very high social cost of the condition.
50-70% of DM1 patients       of working age, are likely to be unemployed.
Figures produced by the       Muscular Dystrophy Association USA indicate that the cost of DM to the US       economy in terms of medical and non-medical expenses and lost income is       roughly $450 million dollars per annumA.
In comparison HOS and       CD are both very rare developmental disorders, each affecting around       1/100,000 individuals, but both are associated with severe physical       abnormality.
The major beneficiaries of the research conducted by Brook, are the       affected individuals and families who can now be provided with very       accurate genetic information and the NHS and global health care providers       who supply this information.
The pathway from research to impact for all       three disorders is the same; original research resulted in gene       identification2,4, followed by detailed analysis of mutations       in patient samples1,3, publication in scientific literature of       the genotype/phenotype relationships5,6 with concomitant       distribution of reagents and relevant knowledge.
Publication of the work       described has resulted in the availability of genetic tests and knowledge       of genotype/phenotype relationships for DM1, HOS or CD, which did not       previously exist.
The effect of the availability of these tests is       described below.
Impact 1 &#8212; DM1     The CTG repeat expansion test for DM1 established by Brook is the       definitive test for the disease and to some extent disease severity and       its benefits are:            symptomatic and pre-symptomatic testing with near 100% accuracy;       prediction of potential severity of disease phenotype;       provision of choice and ability to inform with pre-natal and         pre-implantation diagnosis;       predictive testing of asymptomatic adults in families positive for the         disease facilitating personal life decisions;          An indication of the broad impact of this work is revealed in figures       published by four sources.
The Clinical Molecular Genetics Society audit       shows that 1196 DM1 tests were reported in the UKB for 08/09.
A       further 1334 tests were conducted in 09/10, 1225 in 10/11 and 1252 in       11/12.
During the period 2008 to 2012, 88 pre-natal DM1 diagnostic genetic       tests were conducted in the UKB.
The UK Genetic Testing Network       refers to 15 NHS laboratories that provide these tests, both pre- and       post-natally at a cost of &#163;65 - &#163;460C.
The Genetic Testing       Registry (a publicly funded medical genetics information resource in the       USA), and www.orpha.net (portal for       rare diseases and orphan drugs)C describe 201 clinical       laboratories providing the test in North America, South America, Europe,       Australasia and Asia.
Between 2008 and 2013, 3267 tests were carried out       by 11 of these overseas (non-UK) laboratoriesD.
Healthcare providers worldwide, including those in the UK, Australia,       South Africa and the USA as well as multiple international charities       provide an array of leaflets describing Brook's genetic test for a       definitive diagnosis and severity of DM1E.
At the individual       level the impact of the test is highly significant, as illustrated on the       Muscular Dystrophy Campaign web site.
Here a patient describes diagnosis       with DM leading to subsequent use of the test for pre-implantation genetic       diagnosis screening for a disease-free embryoF.
The       co-ordinator of the Myotonic Dystrophy Support Group in the UKF       and the Executive Director of the Myotonic Dystrophy Foundation in the USAF       affirm that Brook's research and his development of a genetic test for the       unstable CTG repeat has had a profound impact upon individuals with       Myotonic DystrophyG.
With the aid of the test, these       individuals are given both knowledge of their disease and choice.
Impact 2 &#8212; HOS     The TBX5/HOS mutation assay was developed in the Brook lab and       transferred to the NHS molecular genetics laboratory at the Nottingham       University Hospital Trust to provide a diagnostic service for this       disorder.
Between 2008 and 2012 79 post-natal and 2 pre-natal tests to       confirm HOS were carried out in the UKB.
More than 70 mutations       in the TBX5 gene cause HOS and the Brook lab continue to find further TBX5       mutations (Granados-Riveron et al; 2012; doi:       10.1111/j.1747-0803.2011.00573.x) adding to the list of disease causing       mutations and increasing the sensitivity of HOS genetic testing.
Based on       work from the Brook lab HOS genetic testing is available worldwide.
The UK       Genetic Testing Network describes 2 NHS laboratories providing testing for       HOS at a cost of &#163;100 - &#163;400C.
The Genetic Testing Registry and       www.orpha.net cite 44 laboratories in       North America, Europe and Asia offering diagnostic tests for this       conditionC.
Between 2008 and 2013, 140 tests were carried out       by 5 of these laboratoriesD.
The Co-Ordinator of the Holt-Oram Syndrome Support Group confirms that       the availability of a genetic test has had considerable benefit to       individual patients with HOSG.
The test was first described in       pre-implantation genetic diagnosis in 2004H.
In 2012 deCODE       genetics added TBX5 to their repertoire of tests for atrial fibrillation,       demonstrating the test's importance not only for HOS diagnosis, but also       for other conditions that feature congenital heart disordersI.
Impact 3 &#8212; CD     In collaboration with others, the Brook lab discovery of mutations in       SOX9 causing CD has greatly improved the ability to diagnose the disorder.
The SOX9 test is the only genetic test for CD, the availability of which       importantly provides influence on family planning due to the significant       risk of newborn death from breathing problems due to small chest and lung       sizeJ.
The Genetic Testing Registry and www.orpha.net       cite 39 labs in Europe and North America offering CD diagnostic testsC.
Three of these global labs have performed 159 SOX9 genetic tests since       2008D     Impact 4 &#8212; Growth of Genetics Service and Scientific Training     Researchers who trained in the Brook lab moved into positions in       pharmaceutical companies: Terrett and Li with GSK and Ronksley with       Pfizer, indicating that the lab provides highly skilled individuals for       industry.
Genetic tests are provided by both public sector and private       organisations depending upon the healthcare system in various countries.
Consequently, these and other tests require employment of a range of       healthcare professionals involved in prenatal diagnosis and       pre-symptomatic genetic testing.
In the UK the increase in clinical       genetics services reflects the development of genetic tests for inherited       disorders.
Thus, in 2004 there were 148 Consultant Clinical Geneticists       employed by the NHS.
By 2011 this had increased by 29% to 209B.
The number of staff employed in NHS DNA service laboratories has also       increased significantly in recent years, rising from 139 in 1993 to 434 in       2008 and further to 638 in 2012B.
Thus, the research by Brook and colleagues has proved to be of       substantial benefit to patients with DM1, HOS and CD, their families and       the healthcare professionals who care for them.
