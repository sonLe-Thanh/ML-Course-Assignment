     The research project behind `Petit Bayle' consists not only of the       original design for it, but also the construction and continuing       experience and use of it.
This case study is based mainly on the claim       that the widespread reporting of the project to a professional and public       audience and, specifically, the international recognition of it in the         form of the publication of its original detailing in architecture         handbooks or visits to it by sustainable design professionals, are       evidence of continuing impact in the following respects:     REACH: impact on creativity, culture and society: the production       of this cultural artefact has enhanced cultural understanding of       phenomena; informed public and professional attitudes and values; has been       widely shared with general / professional readers on sustainable house       design     REACH: Economic, commercial, organisational impacts: the artefact       demonstrates the development of new or improved materials, products or       processes, as described in output           JS1     SIGNIFICANCE: impact on the environment: the research process and       the artefact are impacting on environmental or architectural design       standards or general practice, and influencing professional practice, as       evidenced by the publication of details in a textbook     SIGNIFICANCE: impact on practitioners and professional services:       the artefact influence on professional standards; development of resources       to enhance professional practice; use of research findings in the conduct       of professional work or practice; professional practice has been informed       or stimulated by research findings; research has challenged conventional       wisdom, stimulating debate among stakeholders.
SIGNIFICANCE: the construction of the project has had some local         economic impact     1 REACH &#8212; details of impact     Articles on Petit Bayle reached a very large number of general and       professional readers through its publication in a variety of different       forms of dissemination.
The output           JS1 reproduces the articles.

2 SIGNIFICANCE &#8212; details of impact     The primary claim made for this impact is that the prominence of the       building in the professional press has contributed to the current       professional debate around the architectural language of sustainable       design, whilst providing clear visual images and architectural solutions       for many current design questions.
Significance to professionals: Significance to professionals is       demonstrated by the prominence of the project in three of the major       British professional journals, the Architectural Review, the Architect's         Journal, and the RIBA Journal, and several heavily visited       international websites, making it unmissable at a time when the elements,       details and language of sustainable architecture and environmental design       are constantly being discussed.
Equally, the building has started to host       visits by professionals.
On 10 July 2012 a group of 20 sustainable       architecture professionals visited the house in an event organised by       Espace Info Energie de Tarn-et-Garonne (part of CAUE, conseil       d'architecture, d'urbanisme et de l'environnement) and further organised       visits are planned [5.1].
The house featured as an exemplary achievement       project in CAUE's 30th Anniversary exhibition.
In the words of the visit       organiser, CAUE's sustainability design expert Karine Ourceval: `un tr&#232;s       grand merci pour la visite.

j'ai &#233;t&#233; ravie de decouvrir et faire       decouvrir votre projet.
Comme l'ensemble des participants, j'ai &#233;t&#233;       conquise.
Votre travail m'a beaucoup touch&#233;' [very many thanks for the       visit...I was delighted to descover your project and introduce it to       others.
Like all the participants, I was enthralled.
Your work greatly       touched me'] [5.2].
The appearance of details of the house in the international textbook Detail         in Contemporary Residential Architecture enables their embedding       into future practice, especially for example by the many architecture and       building students who use the book.
Significance to the general public: The house was featured in Grand         Designs magazine which has a substantial regular readership in       particular among those intending to carry out domestic building influenced       by cutting edge sustainable design, as well as in The New Natural Home.
It has been chosen by Dr Avi Friedman of the McGill School of Architecture       to feature in his forthcoming book Sustainable Dwellings, to be       published by the mass market art and design publisher Rizzoli (New         York), because, in Friedman's words, of its `unique urban solution,       outstanding architectural design, environmental concerns, and for being       exemplary in [its] innovation and detailing' [5.1].
The house has also       featured over six pages in the French magazine Eco Maison Bois       (circ.
58,000).
Economic significance: the construction of the house demonstrated       an investment of &#8364;290,000 in the local economy for the building process       alone, mainly, it being in the nature of the project, in the form of local       labour and local materials.
