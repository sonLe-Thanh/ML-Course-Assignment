 Brown has achieved international and far-reaching impact by working with musicians (in masterclasses, invited lectures, acting as consultant and adviser), writing for them, collecting, analysing and making available important historical materials, and producing scholarly editions for performance.
His expertise has influence across publishing, concert-making, recording, and education sectors.
Brown works with period-instrument groups, advising on performance practice for concerts and recordings.
In the preface to CaRPP [1], Sir Roger Norrington notes that many of the London Classical Players' "landmark recordings [...] were made with his advice and encouragement".
More recently Norrington has underscored his praise, confirming the benefit of Brown's research and advice, and noting "Brown's CHASE project in particular is of major importance to performers worldwide [...] This is research that our musical community needs and relies on" [A] [2].
The Eroica Quartet, devoted to the performance of nineteenth-century music, confirm they are "deeply committed to and influenced by the research associated with the Leeds University AHRC-funded Annotated Editions project (CHASE)"; they suggest that Brown's "original questioning of late-C20th performing orthodoxies [...] is steadily becoming the equivalent to the 1960's revolution in performances of Baroque music" [B].
Players from that quartet pass on this influence working in ensembles ranging from the Orchestre R&#233;volutionaire et Romantique (ORR) and Les Musiciens du Louvre, to Op&#233;ra de Paris: "We [Peter Hanson, David Watkin] also work as section leaders [leader and principal cello] with Sir John Eliot Gardiner [...] Clive Brown's research ideas have given us an immense sense of confidence to try new ideas and techniques with this [ORR] orchestra" [B].
The internationally renowned Elias Quartet's The Beethoven Project blog notes the significance of Brown's CHASE research [2]: "a real treasure for anyone interested in historically informed performance practice of 19th century music" [C]; Martin Saving (the quartet's viola) blogs that CaRPP " is indeed a bible for anyone who wants to know about performance styles during this era", and in discussing tempo he concludes "I'd like to recommend Clive Brown's phenomenal `Classical &amp; Romantic Performing Practice'"[1] [C].
Brown's influence extends from early stages of performance education to the latest.
His article `Notation and Interpretation', which draws on the breadth of his own research, forms a part of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music's guidebook A Performer's Guide to Music of the Romantic Period (&lt;http://shop.abrsm.org/shop/prod/ABRSM-A-Performer-s-Guide-to-Music-of-the-Romantic-Period/701256&gt;), which appears on their Best Sellers list in 2013 and continues to support study and tuition in preparation for ABRSM grade exams.
For more advanced levels, CaRPP in particular appears as a resource for performance courses worldwide (for example supporting A2 level and tertiary foundations, it is specified as part of Singapore's H3 Music syllabus (&lt;http://www.seab.gov.sg/aLevel/2013Syllabus/9819_2013.pdf&gt;)).
Specialists educating the next generations of professional players rate CaRPP highly: "an excellent resource, and probably the best compendium I know of [...], an essential resource" (Barbara Kallaur, historical flutes specialist, Indiana University) [D].
This reputation is echoed by book sellers' selection of review quotes to support sales of CaRPP, (Amazon's product description at &lt;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Classical-Romantic-Performing-Practice-1750-1900/dp/0195166655&gt; [accessed: 15 September 2013], includes "BBC Music Magazine: `This book will revolutionize the study of music', Choice: `Brown has produced a work of the greatest scholarship and utility ... Recommended&#8212;required!&#8212;for all libraries with music collections serving upper-division undergraduates and above', and Musical Times: `The fact that the book focuses on notation will make it permanently useful'").
Brown's research (especially [1], [2], [3], [4]) has informed workshops and masterclasses in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and the USA.
Working with professional group The Ironwood Ensemble at the Sydney Conservatorium in 2012, the first violinist noted that Brown's visit, "was immensely successful [...] for spreading a general consciousness throughout the Con[servatorium] and beyond about the importance and scholarly validity of these performance practices.
[It] felt a little like a national dissemination" [E].
Media coverage gave a popular representation of the work's reach and capacity to change performing cultures: Australia's ABC News featured Brown's research under the title `Orchestras and conductors have lost the rhythm of the great composers', and the introducing continuity announcer chose the sound bite "...a rebellion that could change the way orchestras the world over play classical music" [F].
The Chicagoan violinist Rachel Barton Pine placed Brown's research [3] at the heart of her 2008 CD of the Clement and Beethoven concerti.
She notes Brown's impact on her and the canon of romantic violin concerti, thanking him for reviving Clement, stating, "It's so wonderful all the contributions you've made [...] you've unleashed a wonderful treasure on the world, the Clement Violin Concerto" [G].
The liner notes include a brief essay by Brown, regarded as "indispensable" by Peter Grahame Woolf reviewing Barton Pine's Clement CD (Woolf was journal editor at &lt;http://www.musicalpointers.co.uk/reviews/cddvd08/BeethovenClementConcertos.html&gt;).
The CHASE website [2] makes Brown's research more widely and easily available.
Reviewing web statistics in October 2013 (16 months into its life), there had been over 130,000 page views (the majority unique), with access from over 50 countries; many visits were of several minutes' duration [H].
The influence of the CHASE research finds its way into modern performing editions (for example Stephen Begley's preface to a new Vitali edition cites CHASE project materials [2] [I]).
Brown's opera research has seen new performing versions used internationally.
His edition of Mendelssohn's Die Hochzeit des Camacho [6] (performed 2011 by the European Opera Centre/ Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra/Vasily Petrenko) was reviewed as 4-star in The Guardian; and Brown's edition was then performed by the Opernb&#252;hne Bad Aibling in July 2012.
Brown's first modern production of Pietro von Abano in 2009 was described by Dr Wolfram Boder, author of Die Kasseler Opern Louis Spohr (Kassel: B&#228;renreiter, 2007), as a "lost treasure of opera [...] rediscovered" [J].
It was picked up for performances in Abano Terme and Padua in 2010.
