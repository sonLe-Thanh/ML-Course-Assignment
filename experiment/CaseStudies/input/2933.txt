     Context: Concurrent with ongoing multilateral trade negotiations       (2001-), UoM research has sought to target and maximise impact through the       building of extended and sustained relationships with actors in the WTO       (ambassadors, lawyers and knowledge brokers), national governments       (specifically South Africa, Turkey, The Seychelles and Bangladesh), and       international and national civil society organisations.
The impacts       from this research are threefold:            Informing the negotiating positions of actors within the global trade         architecture       Contributing to the future shaping of the global trade architecture       Shaping participant and policymaker training programmes          Informing negotiating positions: Wilkinson and colleagues have       systematically disseminated their research within a range of international       fora, with findings presented to all of the WTO's high level       ministerial conferences since 2003.
In 2011 a document prepared by       Wilkinson &#8212; `Four Principles for Reforming the WTO' &#8212; was circulated by       the knowledge broker the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable       Development (ICTSD) to all trade delegates (c.2000), including attending       trade ministers, and also translated into Swedish [1].
As the Chief       Executive of ICTSD attests: "findings have been picked up directly by         trade actors, with the research effectively transforming insights,         narratives and bargaining tools for developing countries in the WTO.
Professor Wilkinson's contributions to the work of ICTSD have been         crucial... contributing to our ongoing work on the importance of         sustainable development within the international trade system" [2].
Wilkinson has advised a significant number of governments at the highest       levels.
Prominent examples include South Africa, the Seychelles, Turkey       and Bangladesh.
South Africa: Wilkinson has built a sustained, high-trust       relationship with South African trade negotiators, offering advice on an ad         hoc basis since 2009.
The country's Ambassador, and Permanent       Representative to the WTO, cites the value of publication [E] in his       existing [3] and ongoing work, noting that: "I have also served as the         WTO Chair of the Committee of Trade and Development...
In this capacity,         and as an active participant in several developing country coalitions         and alliances, I have sought out researchers and writers that could         assist me in the work I was doing to advance the interests of developing         countries in the WTO... My association and collaboration with Professor         Rorden Wilkinson enhanced my capacity to engage more effectively in all         of these roles...
Evidence of the influence of Rorden's work on the         negotiations can be seen in at least two WTO proposals that I         co-authored on behalf of developing countries in the WTO...
I have also         had the chance to comment on his work... [where] I pay tribute         to Rorden's research and analytical work, and in particular the value         this has for practitioners, such as myself" [4].
Seychelles: In the period 2007-09 Wilkinson was Special Advisor to       the Vice President and Minister of Finance on WTO accession.
As the Former       Director General of Trade testifies, Wilkinson both assisted in brokering       relationships between Seychelles officials and WTO actors, and "his         research on `asymmetries' was usefully translated into concrete advice         concerning which specific aspects of trade should be open to         liberalisation, and which should be protected as a part of the country's         WTO accession package...
Subsequent to these discussions, the Seychelles         proceeded with re-engaging the WTO in respect of Seychelles' application         of accession but adjusted its offers to the Membership in light of the         advice that Professor Wilkinson provided" [5].
Correspondingly, the       country's Minister of Foreign Affairs points to longer term aspects: "Professor         Wilkinson's work has been particularly important, as at the present time         there is a notable lack of rigorous academic work that underscores both         the vulnerability of the Seychelles economy to fluctuations in external         demand... and the special features of the Seychelles economy, which         require specific policy recommendations...
Professor Wilkinson has         provided useful advice over a period of time [1999-2011] that greatly         assisted our negotiating position.
Seychelles has built a credible offer         for WTO accession... Wilkinson's advice has contributed to this"       [6].
Turkey: In 2007, the Turkish government invited Wilkinson to       contribute a paper to a government sponsored event on foreign trade; the       brief was to come up with `new ideas on trade'.
The paper &#8212; highlighting       institutional asymmetries in international trade; and the role of language       in constructing false representations of developing countries and shaping       their behaviour in international trade &#8212; was subsequently published in the       Undersecretariat's official journal (Vol.3:1, 2009) as `The Problematic of       Trade and Development Beyond the Doha Round', and reported on the major       Turkish trade blog dtm.gov.
As the conference organiser confirms:       "The event was very successful... [and] attended by high ranking         bureaucrats of the Undersecretariat for Foreign Trade as well as by         practitioners of foreign trade... Wilkinson's contribution made a         constructive contribution to ongoing debates within a Turkish context on         the Doha round... and the work continues to be important as revealed by         the comments... from the Undersecretariat" [7].
Bangladesh: Wilkinson has been appointed expert advisor to two       high level working groups, `LDC IV Monitor' and `Future of the UN       Development System'.
The former (a non-official UN sanctioned group) is       facilitated through collaboration between the Commonwealth Secretariat,       OECD Development Centre and the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Bangladesh.
The Chair of LDC IV Monitor confirms that: "Wilkinson's expertise has         been valuable in shaping the structure and content of the upcoming         biennial report of the Monitor.
His comments and observations have         enabled us to significantly improve the key messages... [and] The         chapters on Trade and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) also benefited         greatly from his critical inputs... Wilkinson has helped us to connect         to the frontier issues concerning the development challenges currently         confronted by the LDCs.
Professor Wilkinson's work remains vital, as he         continues to remain engaged with the LDC IV Monitor" [8].
Rethinking global trade architecture: In order to enhance the       hands-on policy engagement documented above, debates concerning the       contours of global trade have been nurtured.
Wilkinson's dissemination and       consulting activities, via a network of high level contacts across a range       of states and organisations, were mobilised within the inaugural Global       Poverty Summit in South Africa (16-19/1/2011).
This event, initiated,       co-ordinated and convened by Wilkinson, brought together 50 of the world's       leading poverty thinkers (including former heads of state, serving       ministers, country ambassadors, iconic and Nobel Prize winning       intellectuals, leading academics, heads of international NGOs, and       secretaries-general, under secretaries-general and assistant       secretaries-general of UN Institutions).
The purpose of the event was to       influence progress in two international public policy initiatives &#8212; the       Millennium Development Goals and the WTO's Doha Development Agenda &#8212; as       well as engage in public debate.
At the conclusion of the summit, two       major international declarations were agreed and produced by participants       on `Africa and the Doha Development Agenda' and `Africa and the Millennium       Development Goals'.
The Deputy Director General of the WTO (also Nigeria's       Ambassador and Permanent Representative) substantiates the value of this       event, and Wilkinson's contributions to WTO ministerial fora       (2003-2011), stating that: "I have found Professor Wilkinson's work         particularly helpful in the shaping of the global trade agenda, with         respect to the interaction between trade policy, trade negotiations,         sustainable development and poverty reduction... Wilkinson has also been         of assistance in the development of Nigeria's negotiation positions,         especially in finding the balance of commitments and the movement from         defending positions towards finding compromises...
This research will         continue to be valuable in advancing meaningful discussions on various         issues under the Doha Work Programme, including the package for the Bali         Ministerial Conference (MC9)... as well as the post-Bali agenda"       [9].
The Summit was followed up by a `Commission on the Future of the       Multilateral Trading System' (Cape Town, 5/12/2012) funded by BWPI, DTI       South Africa and the World Bank.
Training Programmes: Wilkinson has disseminated his research on       institutional asymmetries in trade and the role of crisis in trade       negotiations in the UK (2006-), running training packages on `Regional       Trade Agreements (RTAs) and development policies &#8212; including `US and EC       preferential trade policies and impact on developing countries', `WTO       negotiations' and `Global Trade Regulation' &#8212; for the British Institute of       International and Comparative Law (BIICL), Advocates for International       Development (A4ID &#8212; who offer pro bono support to developing       countries in trade negotiations) and for the International Trade Division       of the Department for International Development (DfID).
Many of these       sessions have been recorded for future use and wider dissemination.
Wilkinson also enjoyed a key role within the UN Summer Academy programme;       2012 (Turin) and 2013 (New York).
In 2013, Wilkinson contributed a keynote       lecture on UN Reform &#8212; `Global Governance and the United Nations:       Understanding the UN in a Rapidly Changing World' &#8212; in an all-day session.
The course co-ordinator verifies that "Wilkinson's in-depth knowledge         and passion for the topic provoked vital discussions on the key         challenges of global governance... [and] really set the tone and         the high pace of the successful event...
The contribution of academics         such as Professor Wilkinson is vital in that it provides an outside         perspective to UN staff members... Wilkinson's contribution was very         effective, particularly in highlighting critical considerations of         global governance which set the environment for informed decisions on         the role of the United Nations in this rapidly changing world... he has         demonstrated himself as one of only a few academics with real insight         and knowledge in both global governance, and the UN as an important         multilateral organisation" [10].
