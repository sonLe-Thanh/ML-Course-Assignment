     A major success of the University of Surrey's cross disciplinary       Knowledge Transfer discovery programme was making the connection between       research in spacecraft control and its application to the acceleration of       animation software.
The technology embedded in IKinema represents a revolution in       computational efficiency and is the first really new advance in the field       of animation for many years.
It creates a paradigm shift in the computer       game and film industries and will enable any company that controls it to       gain significant strategic advantage over its competition.
Previous       animation technologies have been "straight-jacketed" by their huge code       size and processing requirement, and their inability to run in real-time       on any platform; IKinema's technology frees them from all of this with its       small code size by enabling very fast, very computationally efficient,       runtime animation on any platform.
The technology which runs equally well       in a browser, has created opportunities for new business models and       revenue generation, protected by patent filings.
The underlying IP is relatively generic and applies to several areas,       including spacecraft control, robotics, protein folding, stress analysis       and computer animation.
Patents are granted in France, UK, Germany and       pending in US, India, Canada and China.
The IKinema trademark is granted       in US and Europe.
Surrey's research, now embedded in technology, is being commercialised by       IKinema, www.ikinema.com a spin-out       from the University of Surrey.
The company, founded in 2010, employs 6       staff and is profitable, with 80% of sales revenues generated by export.
There are 3 main products offered by IKinema all based on the research       conducted at Surrey; IKinema Action for Maya, IKinema WebAnimate and       IKinema RunTime.
IKinema motion capture technology is now used by leading studios, such as       Hollywood 20th Century Fox, Disney, Industrial Light &amp;       Magic, and the firm also counts US, UK, Japan with studios such as       Framestore, Luxology, Square Enix, Audio Motion and partners such as       NVidia, Autodesk, Intel, Vicon, Xsens and The Foundry.
Although no users have fully quantified the benefits in monetary terms it       has enabled them to speed up and improve their animation, pre-viz and       motion capture pipelines.
In a pilot test Microsoft estimated that iKinema software reduced       animation costs by 80%.Since animation is estimated as 50% of a game's       development cost this would reduce the overall cost by 40%.
The 3D       modelling and animation market in 2008 was worth $237M, whilst the video       games market in 2011 was worth $65B.
20th Century Fox Director CINEDEV (Cinematic Development), comments:     "I am beyond excited to integrate IKinema into my performance capture         pipeline.
IKinema's full body solver is unmatched in its ability to         duplicate human behaviour.
It allows me to quickly adjust performance         capture on the fly with just a few controls.
I no longer need to spend         hours tweaking curves to get a result.
IKinema is now an essential part         of my process now and in the future."
Head of rigging at Framestore states;     "The IKinema solver is a fantastic solution for a wide range of         skeleton control issues,"     "By using IKinema's advanced solver settings and its extremely         flexible constraint system, we have been able to iteratively improve our         solving solution and accuracy.
With the ability to easily reproduce this         same setup script on many shots, we will be shaving days and weeks off         our production time."
President and founder of Luxology stated;     "Bringing IKinema tech into modo was a smooth process for us,".....         "We also found that once it was in, the flexibility of the code allowed         us to adapt it to a wide range of applications, from simple-to-use         posing tools to sophisticated IK support for complex character rigs.
Each an essential piece of the modo 601 character animation experience."
VICON CEO and President comments:     "IKinema provides a new and exciting method of mocap data manipulation         inside of Maya.
This is great news for Blade users!"
Difference Engine Studios comments:     "A breeze to use.
The learning curve is incredibly shallow and short,         and it only took us a couple hours to be able to put together some         interesting rigs with it.
This looks to save us a lot of time and money,         too.
Amazingly, we are getting close to real-time broadcast-quality         animation with this system.
In conclusion, this is one piece of software         that has gone from 'Interesting' to 'Must Have' in about two days."
For the quality of the invention and the potential international impact,       Dr. Pechev received the 2010 Royal Academy of Engineering Entrepreneurs       Award and the Royal Society of Edinburgh Enterprise Fellowship.
