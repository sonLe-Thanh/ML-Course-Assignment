     The AHRC project had a direct impact in changing how OPCAT was       implemented in the       international arena (by influencing the work of the SPT and the       development of the OPCAT       Contact Group, a coalition of key NGOs in the field of torture       prevention), in diverse domestic       arenas (including the UK government), and through the research team       providing comments on       draft and existing domestic legislation.
This was because the research       programme was designed       in close collaboration with the SPT, national preventive mechanisms,       governments, UN Office of       the High Commissioner for Human Rights and NGOs.
The AHRC itself described       the research       project as having a "dramatic impact" and "A project which has         made important advances in         reducing the likelihood of torture around the world" [a, p 27].
International arena     The research team was used as a platform and resource by those involved       in implementing       OPCAT at all levels &#8212; national, regional and international &#8212; to develop       their ideas and agenda.
First, the research team had considerable impact on the SPT, the UN body       which has operational       oversight of the implementation of OPCAT and an advisory function which       involves providing       assistance and advice to both States parties and NPMs.
The research team       wrote the NPM       Guidelines which are now used extensively by the SPT, governments and       others as a benchmark       for the establishment and operation of NPMs at the national level [e].
These guidelines drew upon       work already carried out by members of the team [2].
The research team       also have standing -       including being invited to attend and making formal statements &#8212; at the       SPT's sessions in Geneva.
The team provided the Subcommittee with briefings on states that it then       used as background       information for its visits to these countries.
In its second annual report       [b] in 2009, the       Subcommittee stated: "The SPT has remained in close contact with         Bristol University's OPCAT         Project and has exchanged ideas and views on a number of issues central         to the SPT's work.
The         project team has been involved in organizing regional activities and has         provided a critical external         academic perspective concerning aspects of the SPT's work, for which the         SPT is very grateful"       (para 59).
Secondly, during the AHRC-funded project [5], the researchers established       the "OPCAT Contact       Group", comprising relevant civil society organisations (such as the       Mental Disability Advocacy       Centre and Penal Reform International) and including the "Bristol OPCAT       Group" [b, Annex VI].
The Contact Group subsequently obtained standing before the SPT, which       generally operates in       private, underlining the privileged position of this group.
This influence       has continued.
So, for       example, in his statement to the 67th Session of the UN General       Assembly (2012), the SPT Chair       (by then, Evans) drew particular attention to the support of the OPCAT       Contact Group as one of       the key civil society bodies which had assisted in the "quite         remarkable" amount of change within       the first six years of OPCAT [d].
The research team has drawn on the       Contact Group's access to       the SPT to make recommendations on the Subcommittee's annual reports -       indeed, as a result of       one such intervention, the SPT amended the format of its annual reports in       line with the       researchers' recommendations [l] [c, para 1].
Even more importantly, the       SPT adopted the       research conclusions by changing the nature and structure of its visiting       programme to include       national preventive mechanism advisory visits (the first of which were       conducted in 2012) [e].
In its       fourth annual report in 2010 [c], the SPT noted that it had "...continued         to benefit from the essential         support provided by civil society actors, both the OPCAT Contact Group         (present during the         Subcommittee's November session) and academic institutions (in         particular the Universities of         Bristol ...), both for the promotion of the Optional Protocol and its         ratification, and for         Subcommittee activities" (para 39).
Thirdly, one of the researchers (Evans) was made a member of the       Subcommittee in 2009 and       was subsequently appointed as Chair in 2011.
This appointment reflects the       visibility and influence       that the AHRC-funded research programme had obtained.
By acting as its       Chair, the       recommendations of the research team have a direct and powerful influence       on the operation of       the SPT [d][e].
Domestic arena     The research team can point to direct impact on policy changes in a       number of contexts which can       be attributed directly to the events and activities they carried out       during the project.
For example, at       the first Bristol OPCAT conference in April 2007 and subsequently in       November 2007 , the UK       government realised that its proposed NPM would not provide coverage for       police cells [k].
As a       direct result, after the conference, in 2008 and subsequently the remits       of the HM Inspectorate of       Prisons (HMIP) and HM Inspectorate of Constabulary were amended to ensure       they could visit       these particular places of detention [j], thereby increasing the UK's       compliance with its international       treaty obligations.
The research team developed a close relationship with       HMIP and the UK NPM,       as illustrated by the adoption of a Memorandum of Understanding between       the research team and       the UK NPM in 2012.
A seminar was co-hosted by the HRIC and the UK NPM in       December 2009.
One further concrete outcome of that seminar was that the UK NPM       recognised that its size and       complexity required that the mandates and methodologies of each of its       members should be       mapped, a task which the researchers themselves addressed [f].
The       regularly updated database       of the 18 members of the UK NPM is hosted by the University of Bristol but       linked from the NPM       and Ministry of Justice websites [g].
This has been used by the NPM       members and others and has       increased the visibility of the work of the NPM in the UK.
Development of Legislation     In addition, in this REF period, the research team have been asked, and       continue to receive       requests, for advice on draft and existing legislation on NPMs in a range       of countries (Maldives,       Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Paraguay, South       Africa, and Montenegro)       [for example, [i]-[k]].
In some cases, the research team saw and commented       on several drafts of       legislation which had a direct impact on the final legislative product.
Layla Duisekova, UN       Development Programme, wrote to the research team that: "Your visit at         the end of January was a         turning point in the NPM law making process".
Ulugbek Asimov       (Kyrygystan) wrote to the       researchers as follows: "I would like to congratulate also you on this         occasion.
To a large extent         thanks to your involvement, your invaluable advice, recommendations,         letters of support it has         been possible to adopt this important piece of legislation" [i].
Evans and Murray participated in a       confidential meeting to prepare Hungary for the operation of the NPM and       their contributions are       reflected in the recommendations from that meeting [j].
All of this advice       draws upon the research       described in section 3 above.
