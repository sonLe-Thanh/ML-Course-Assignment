     The FABIC study was wholly responsible for the withdrawal of six           food additives from the           shelves of major supermarkets and the menus of leading fast-food           restaurants in the UK,           eventually forcing a change in European Union legislation.
This reduced the risk of children       across Europe &#8212; including the estimated 462,000 in the UK suffering from       ADHD &#8212; being exposed       to these potentially harmful food colourings.
Children's health was           thus improved through the           reduction of hyperactivity associated with difficulties in learning to           read, wider behavioural           issues in later childhood and social isolation [5.1, 5.2].
Although it commissioned the study, the Food Standards Agency (FSA)       initially contested the       findings published in The Lancet in 2007.
But huge pressure from       international media and       consumer groups, combined with lobbying from the Southampton study       authors, pushed the issue       up the political agenda.
Although much of the widespread media coverage &#8212;       including front-page       news in The Guardian and lead items on BBC Radio 4's Today       &#8212; occurred in September 2007,       before the beginning of REF `impact period', the weight of public interest       ensured its impact       continued into 2008.
For example, the Daily Mail launched a `Ban       the Additives' campaign and       provided continued coverage in 2008 [5.4].
It claimed support from       all the major supermarkets in       the UK and pledges from numerous firms, including Cadbury and Mars, to       remove the colourings.
The FABIC study remains one of the most highly covered stories released by       the University of       Southampton press office.
Two months after the study was published the       Food Commission, a not-for-profit       company that campaigns for healthier and safer food in the UK, launched       `Action on       Additives', a campaign to list all the foods, drinks and medicines       containing the six additives [5.5].
In January 2008 the Parliamentary Food and Health Forum, comprising peers       and MPs from all       parties, recommended a ban on the six and criticised the FSA for failing       to protect children.
In April       2008 the FSA called for a voluntary ban on the colourings, which it now       referred to as the       `Southampton Six' [5.1].
A legal ban could not be enacted by UK       legislation, but the FSA formally       recommended government ministers back a Europe-wide ban.
Referring to       Southampton's       research, the FSA said it had based its recommendation on `a scientific       study of the highest quality'       [5.1].
The Southampton team provided the European Food Standards       Agency (EFSA) with       evidence and raw data, responded to queries and attended an EFSA working       group meeting in       Brussels.
In July 2008 the European Parliament voted in favour of a           legal requirement to           label foods containing the `Southampton Six' with the words `May have           an adverse effect on           activity and attention in children' [5.3].
In November 2008 UK ministers accepted the FSA's proposal for a           voluntary ban.
Since then       the issue has remained in the spotlight through continued pressure from       consumer groups and the       media.
An online survey of more than a thousand mothers by Net Mums, a       website with 4 million       visitors, showed 87% wanted the additives removed and 98% were worried       about the colourings'       impact on their children's health and behaviour [5.6] &#8212; statistics       quoted on BBC Five Live and ITN       News.
In 2009, as part of its ongoing review of food additive safety [5.7],       the EFSA lowered the       Acceptable Daily Intakes for three of the six colourings.
According to the FSA's figures in January 2012, in the UK the           product lines of 10 leading           restaurant chains, including McDonald's and Pizza Hut, 90 food           manufacturers, including           Heinz and Northern Foods, and 15 food retailers, including Tesco and           Sainsbury's, are free           from the `Southampton Six' [5.8].
This reflects the FABIC       study's impact on a multi-billion-pound       industry.
According to a 2011 report by Leatherhead Food Research, `The       Global Food Additives       Market' [5.9], global sales of food and drink additives reached       $27.4bn in 2010.
However, the       report noted: `The trend towards natural and/or additive-free food and       drinks is expected to       continue in the short term, largely due to increasing consumer concern       over artificial ingredients.'
The US Food and Drug Administration assessed the research, but it       required evidence of harm       from individual food colourings and so chose not to act.
While the UK       government is prepared to       consider the precautionary principle when developing policy on food,       pressure from a profit-driven       industry acts as a powerful political restraint in the US.
Nonetheless, through           media coverage           and consumer pressure groups, the Southampton study has informed the           public debate           over the safety of food additives in the United States.
In 2009 a paper was published specifically on the impact of       the FABIC study on government       policy [5.10].
