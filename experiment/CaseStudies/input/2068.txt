     This case study gives an example how the RG1 provides solutions to       practical problems by direct engagement with industrial partners.
The main       beneficiaries are test engineers (e.g.
those in the Logic Devices       Consortium at IMEC) and equipment suppliers (e.g.
Keithley Instruments).
The details of the impact for each are given in what follows.
Keithley Instruments: Keithley, as a global prime test equipment       supplier, played a leading role in disseminating the new technique.
After       demonstrating the new technique on the home-made facility [R2.1], the RG1       made an effort to maximise its reach and impact by working with     Keithley.
By implementing the technique on the industrial-standard       equipment, it opened a channel for its dissemination to the Keithley's       world-wide customer base.
The RG1's activities in developing new measurement techniques have been       noted by Keithley and an agreement was signed with Keithley to implement       these new techniques on Keithley's instruments in 2010 [C2.1].
After the       take-over of Keithley by Tektronix, the collaboration agreement was       renewed in 2013 [C2.2].
Following the publication of the new technique for       mobility in 2012 [R2.1], Keithley noticed its advantages and "believes       that equipping its instrument with such advanced techniques will give it a       competitive edge" [C2.2], "as it demonstrates the capability of 4200-SCS       and explores its application potential" [C2.1].
Keithley provided its most       advanced ultra-fast pulse test module 4225 to the University to implement       this technique [C2.2].
By working together with Keithley, the RG1 made the       following key contributions:            It demonstrated that the new technique can be implemented on the         industrial standard equipment, as reported in March 2013 [C2.3].
It prepared the application note no.
3236, authored by Z.Ji from the         RG1 [C2.1, C2.4]; the application note is available at Keithley's         website addresses given in [C2.4].
It prepared the control software [C2.1, C2.5], available through         Keithley's website given in [C2.5].
Keithley has been disseminating information about this technique to its       world-wide customers by highlighting it in its quarterly newsletter "Test       Patterns", which was also sent to its global customers by email [C2.6].
It       is drawing attention to this technique as one of the strengths for its       award-winning 4200-SCS instruments in its sales promotion [C2.1].
These       activities provide mechanisms for a global reach and impact.
According to       the data provided by Keithley, 67 customers downloaded the application       notes on the same day when they received the email notification regarding       the new feature.
Each 4200 instrument costs US$ 80k, but it offers       multi-functionality and it is difficult for Keithley to tell how many       customers purchased it just because of this new feature.
The Logic Devices Consortium at IMEC: The members of this       Consortium include Intel, Global Foundries, TSMC, Sony, Panasonic, and       Xilinx.
The RG1 has collaborated with it for 20 years [C2.7].
The Consortium supported the research into a new technique by providing       three sets of test samples requested by the RG1: one set (2.3-nm SiO2)       as the benchmark and two sets for testing the applicability of the new       technique to samples of high trapping (1.65-nm HfSiON/SiON) and high gate       leakage (1.28-nm HfSiON/SiON).
These samples were the same as those used       by the Consortium for technology development [C2.7].
As the users of the new technique, IMEC [C2.7] corroborates that "the new       mobility measurement technique simplifies the test procedure without using       the expensive RF setup, has better accuracy and efficiency".
The       significance of the improvement is supported by the following quantitative       information:     (i) Reduced cost: The quotations received by the RG1 show       that a typical RF probe station costs approximately &#163;130k and it also       requires network analyser, such as Agilent PNA, costing over &#163;70k.
In       addition, the test devices should have special RF structures, whose cost       is manufacturer-specific.
All of these are not required for the new       technique.
(ii) Improved reliability: The commercial capacitance metre       can only tolerate gate leakage below 10 A/cm2, which is lower       than the gate leakage in advanced transistors.
The capacitance measured by       the new technique is independent of gate leakage and it has been       demonstrated that mobility can be extracted with a gate leakage as high as       40 A/cm2 [R2.1, R2.2].
(iii) Better accuracy: The drain voltage mismatch induces       an error over 20% and the charge trapping can cause an additional 20%       error [R2.1, R2.2].
These errors were eliminated by the new technique.
(iv) Improved efficiency: The existing technique measures       current and mobile charges separately, whilst the new technique measures       them simultaneously, so that the number of tests is halved [R2.1, R2.2].
