     Economic impacts       Economic impacts include the genesis of The Mesquite Company (TMC) in       Texas.
Joe Prest,       Director of TMC, confirmed that he "used these reports [a,b]         as a knowledge base in a commercial         venture" and found them "a gold mine of information".
The       documents were influential in Prest       setting up the success of his commercial venture.
TMC now sells over       USD25,000 of Prosopis       wood monthly for flooring and furniture, and supplies barbeque restaurants       with Prosopis charcoal       worth USD150,000 per year [c].
In Kenya, the ability of the authorities to correctly distinguish between       the species of Prosopis       contributed to the overturning of a blanket ban on the use of plant-based       charcoal and opened up       the opportunity for a commercial venture in the Green Power Station, to be       fuelled by Prosopis       charcoal.
Tower Power Baringo Ltd (TPB) are currently establishing this       power station [e].
Saleem       Ahmed of TPB confirmed that in order to stockpile the 70,000 tonnes of       green material needed to       run the power station, 97% will be from Prosopis.
In order to       generate this stockpile, the power       station already employs 2,000 previously unemployed people [e].
This makes       the power station the       largest employer in the District, offering salaries of &#163;125-130 per month,       higher than the regional       average.
Dr Choge, Principal Research Officer from the Kenyan Forestry       Research Institute       (KEFRI) stated this has "changed people's lives because they now have         a livelihood."
Ahmed has       stated that this "wouldn't have happened without Harris's contribution         via regional-level research".
Impacts on public policy and services       In Kenya, Prosopis has spread over an estimated 41.5 million       hectares severely affecting farming       and grazing.
Coventry, with the Kenyan Forestry Research Institute, ran a       series of workshops       during 2008 in Baringo, Garissa and Tana River Districts.
Choge confirmed       that at each locality, 50       people were trained in the utilisation and management of Prosopis,       and that Kenyan government       officers responsible for agriculture, livestock and environment also       participated.
The following two       policy impacts in Kenya have resulted from the underpinning research,       intermediate dissemination       and subsequent workshops:-            In 2008, the Kenyan Government produced draft legislation proposing         the control of Prosopis         using a biological control insect.
Choge confirmed that the Kenyan         Government has recently         changed its approach towards Prosopis from "eradication           towards management", emphasising         that this change in policy has been influenced by the Kenyan Forestry         Research Institute and         the Unit's research.
Until 2008, most use of trees for charcoal was illegal in Kenya.
The         classification and research         knowledge on the utilization of Prosopis by Coventry contributed         to the blanket ban being lifted,         and permitted Prosopis being used as a charcoal source, allowing         communities in Kenya to         start commercial production.
Official records of charcoal sales gathered         from individual         communities in all the three districts since the charcoal trade ban was         lifted averaged &#163;440,000         per year.
Bennett's research on rangeland management has stimulated policy       debate in South Africa.
Tshintsha Amakhaya, an alliance of rural people and NGOs in South Africa,       invited Bennett to give       a presentation at an expert workshop held by the Grassland Society in 2010       entitled:       `Mainstreaming new paradigms in communal rangelands: how can we         influence policy in South         Africa'.
The workshop brought together policymakers, practitioners       and researchers working in the       area of communal rangeland in South Africa, including senior       representatives from the National       Department of Agriculture.
The workshop enabled a common understanding of       rangeland       problems between researchers and policymakers, and led to the National       Department of       Agriculture stating they would like a regular platform to discuss these       issues with experts [g].
As a       result, sessions have been allocated at Annual Grassland Congresses every       year since 2010 and       interest in the debate is growing (45 people were involved in the 2012       discussions).
In 2013 Bennett guest-edited a Special Issue of the African       Journal of Range and Forage Science       entitled `Aligning policy with the socio-ecological dynamics of rangeland       commons' [f].
This Special       issue has provided a pathway to research impact.
It was launched in South       Africa at the Grassland       Society Annual Congress in July 2013, with two hundred people in       attendance.
A subsequent       panel discussion at the Congress attracted the attention of senior       figures, including the South       African Deputy Director-Generals for Animal Production and Rangeland in       the National Department       of Agriculture (which is part of the larger Department of Agriculture,       Horticulture and Fisheries).
The launch re-emphasised the need for policy makers to incorporate the       expertise of the       Grassland Society (highlighted by Bennett's Special Issue) in       policy.
Following the panel       discussion the Grassland Society was approached in July 2013 to contribute       to the "Policy for the       sustainable management of veld (range) and forage resources in South       Africa" [h].
Impacts on society, culture and creativity       The Unit ran a series of dissemination workshops on Prosopis in       India, and subsequently Kenya.
Beneficiaries included trainees from local farmer field schools, village       chiefs and district officials.
The       first Unit-led Prosopis workshop ran in 1999.
In 2001 workshops       were held in three states of India,       with more than 150 participants.
In 2006 a workshop was held in Kenya,       with 26 attendees, on the       use of Prosopis flour and chainsaw milling for Prosopis       timber.
In addition, public forums were led       by the Unit and the Kenyan Forestry Research Institute in Baringo, Garissa       and Tana River       localities each attracting over 200 participants.
Since then, the Kenyan       Forestry Research Institute       have extended the training courses nationally across Kenya, and       internationally in Djibouti.
Studies conducted in 2012 concluded that the sale of Prosopis       products is now providing up to 46%       of family income in Baringo, and approaching one million pounds per year       of additional income in       Baringo, Garissa and Tana River since 2008 [d].
Included in       this was income earned from the sale of       pods for animal feed and poles used in the construction of local huts,       particularly in Garissa where       they are used in the Dadaab refugee camp, the largest in the world.
These       huge benefits are       considered self-sustaining and expected to increase.
Choge [d]       noted that "there is an increasing use         of processed Prosopis pods by many communities for feeding livestock as         a positive impact of the         awareness and training programmes in the recent years by the Government         and other development         partners".
Conclusion       This case study demonstrates that the Unit's research had economic         impact and enabled The       Mesquite Company to diversify and enter into entirely new profitable       markets.
It has also opened       up the opportunity for a Prosopis-fuelled power station.
In       addition, the research has an impact on         public policy and services providing information to both South       African and Kenyan government       officials.
The Prosopis research enabled the Kenyan government to       lift a blanket ban on plant-based       charcoal and change its policy approach to Prosopis from       "eradication to management".
The       rangeland management research has informed South African policy debate.
