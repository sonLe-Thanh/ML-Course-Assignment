     Impacts on public policy and services     Vincent's research has influenced government policy.
Her research       findings led the Scottish       Government to rewrite national guidance on SCRs.
Vincent is a member of       the working group       tasked with doing this and chair of the Family Involvement sub-group.
She       has played a major role       in the rewrite.
Vincent presented the findings of the Audit and Review at a Child       Protection Committee (CPC)       Chairs Meeting attended by 60 representatives from all CPCs in Scotland       and at a Scottish       Government seminar attended by 50 civil servants and senior managers from       CPCs.
The Western       Isles CPC organised their own seminar to consider the findings at which       Vincent presented to 50       policy makers, managers and practitioners.
She also delivered the key note       presentation at a       Central and North East Scotland Child Protection Consortium Inter-Agency       Practitioner Seminar       attended by 120 practitioners, senior managers and councillors which       considered the implications       of the research for local policy and practice.
Feedback forms provide       evidence that attendees       aimed to use the research findings to inform policy, practice or training.
Perth and Kinross CPC       benchmarked their local arrangements, policies and practices, against       Vincent's research.
This led       to them reviewing their SCR Protocol; reviewing and updating Practitioner       Guidance on Information       Sharing; Confidentiality; and Consent; producing an OnLine Practitioner's       Toolkit; reviewing and       updating Practitioner Guidance on CPCC Meetings; Single and Integrated       Chronologies; and       Assessments; developing a training course to further develop joint working       between adult and       Children's Services; reviewing their approach to Children Affected by       Domestic Abuse, Parental       Mental Health and Parental Substance Misuse; and further developing their       use of CPC       Management Information and Statistics.
North Ayrshire used the research       findings to inform       analysis of the data they collect; alongside local self-evaluation and       audit material to ensure they       are aware of common themes in cases of child death and serious abuse; to       inform the       development of a template for social service team managers to identify       risk when reviewing the       effectiveness of child protection plans; in the development of       multi-agency guidance for the sharing       of information between adult and children's services; and referenced it in       their roll out of the       National Risk Framework.
Vincent's research has also stimulated international policy debate.
Vincent has responded to       numerous requests for information and advice from people engaged in CDR in       Australia, New       Zealand, the US, Canada and South Africa.
Some of these requests have come       from individuals       who have been asked to set up new CDR processes and her research has been       used to inform the       models they have selected.
For example:     `I have come across your publication &#8212; Preventing Child Death as well         as a forthcoming publication         in the journal Child Abuse Review.
I am really interested to         draw lessons from your work as it will         be critical to inform our process in South Africa' (Director of the       Children's Institute, South Africa,       August 2013).
Vincent was asked to provide a key note address at the Third Australian       Conference on Child       Death Inquiries and Reviews in Sydney in 2012.
The conference was attended       by 200 individuals       involved in undertaking CDR across Australia and New Zealand.
While in       Sydney she was also       invited to meet the New South Wales Minister for Family and Community       Services to discuss child       protection.
Impacts on practitioners and services     Professional guidelines and training have been influenced by the research       and practitioners have       used it in conducting their work.
Perth and Kinross CPC use Vincent's       findings and cite her       publications in their Two-Day Inter-Agency Child Protection Training       Course.
North Ayrshire CPC       has integrated the research into a number of their multi-agency child       protection training       programmes, including training aimed at managers.
Vincent has received       email communications       from professionals who have attended her presentations or read her       publications stating that they       have used her research findings to inform their practice.
For example:     `We have started to track risk factors present in the cases we review         for child welfare.
Your section         on risk factors will be very helpful' (Member of the Death under       five Committee, Chief Coroner's       Office, Ontario, Canada, November 2012)     `I gave a presentation yesterday morning to the whole of my office on         my trip to Belfast.
I presented         information from your slides in regard to the value of child death         inquiries.'
(Project Officer, Office       of the Child Safety Commissioner, Victoria, Australia, May 2012)     `Without doubt the book and the research has informed our thinking,         has shaped our practice         arrangements and highlighted to us local risks.'
(Child Protection       Inter-Agency Coordinator, Perth       and Kinross Council, January 2013).
