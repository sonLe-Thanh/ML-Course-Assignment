     The impact of Dr Pittard's research is threefold:     (1) It has influenced the development of Portsmouth City Council's         (PCC) policies relating to culture and literacy: Dr Pittard's       research into Crime Writing had a strong impact on PCC's outlined Cultural       Services and Tourism strategy, strengthening the city's reputation as a       literary city.
During 2010-11, PCC consulted Pittard in order to develop       its literature strategy (sources 1, 4, 5) and its 2013 project The         Home of Great Writing, which aims to boost tourism and improve       literacy rates in the city (sources 1, 2, 3, 5).
Pittard's expertise in       local heritage figures such as Charles Dickens and Arthur Conan Doyle was       vital for the development of PCC's policy on cultural heritage and its       literature strategy, and to the organisation of several public events       (described below) to promote the cultural profile of the city.
More       widely, Pittard's engagement with PCC's key cultural services was crucial       in developing the Cultural Blueprint outlined as part of their Cultural       Services Business Plan (2010-2013), demonstrating PCC's commitment to       cultural heritage (source 3).
(2) It has contributed to the enrichment of Portsmouth's cultural         capital and the creative practice of its residents through local tourism         and public events that have enhanced the city's cultural life:       Pittard's research has developed stimuli to tourism and contributed to the       quality of the tourist experience in Portsmouth.
Pittard's work was       central to the series of events (including public panel discussions and       film screenings) that took place over 21-25 February 2011 organised to       relaunch the Doyle collection; one of these events was Pittard's       participation in Decoding Sherlock (23 February 2011), a public       panel event involving debate with Hampshire Police about Doyle's legacy       and the relevance of his writing to modern policing and social policy.
Pittard's work on crime narratives was thus employed in mediating modern       understandings of crime, addressing problems identified in PCC policy (PCC       identifies the reduction of the fear of crime as a key corporate priority       (Source 3)).
Pittard has also been involved in BookFest, a central       strand of the Home of Great Writing programme and a major tourist       event; his research informed this event on 22 October 2011 when he       interviewed Claire Tomalin on Dickens' influence on the emergence of       popular genres including detective fiction (source 8); this event drew an       audience of 120 people.
The success of Bookfest (with 2,444       attendants in 2011, generating a surplus of &#163;431) and further consultation       with the Centre for Studies in Literature led the council to launch       another major festival, Portsmouth Thought, in 2013, as part of       which Pittard held a public discussion on 23 January 2013 with the       psychologist Maria Konnikova on the psychological methods of Doyle's       fiction (http://teamlocals.co.uk/maria-konnikova-interview-author-of-mastermind-how-to-think-like-sherlock-holmes)       (25 tickets sold).
Pittard organised and participated in a public       discussion with the historian Judith Flanders on 31 May 2013, an event       which raised public awareness of PCC's Conan Doyle collection (source 7)       and promoted new creative practice.
Audience feedback for this event (via       questionnaire) was overwhelmingly positive, with several commenting on the       impact of the event on their understanding of Victorian culture and       creative practice (`I feel very inspired', `It will make me read Dickens       again', `It has given me lots of ideas for my own novel').
The       sustainability of this impact is evident in further collaborations with       PCC, such as an AHRC-funded Collaborative Doctoral Award, a three-year       project, beginning in September 2013, to develop public awareness of the       holdings of the Arthur Conan Doyle collection through a new website,       public access events, and a public lecture on Doyle's legacy.
Dr Pittard's       expertise in this field and the work of the PhD student will be crucial in       developing the case for MLA accreditation of the collection, an aim       identified in the Portsmouth Local Economy Assessment (January 2012)       (source 2).
(3) It has created internationally disseminated educational resources:       Pittard was an on-screen contributor (alongside John Sutherland and Kate       Flint) for an Open University film, Reading and Studying Literature,       filmed in November 2010 and released in September 2012 (as part of Open       University course A320).
Pittard's contribution related to Conan Doyle and       the Strand Magazine.
Internationally, Pittard has also given       public talks on Victorian culture at the Dickens Universe, University of       California, Santa Cruz (source 6), an event with a substantial public       audience (attended annually by 300 members of the public); the reach and       significance of this event is reflected in media coverage (Guardian       (http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2010/aug/06/charles-dickens-universe-annual-conference);        New Yorker (http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/08/29/110829fa_fact_lepore)).
