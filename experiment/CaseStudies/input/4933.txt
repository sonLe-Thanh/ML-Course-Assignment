     Our research has had an impact in six main areas: patient safety, quality       of life, healthcare costs, management guidelines, prescribing practice and       opportunities for the pharmaceutical industry.
Patient safety:     Before our research, the only way to reduce the risk of a non-steroidal       anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-associated ulcer complication was to avoid       using NSAIDs or to use low doses.
Previously recommended measures such as       the use of slow release or effervescent preparations or enteric coating       were at best ineffective.
NSAIDs were regarded as the biggest iatrogenic       cause of hospitalisation and death worldwide.
The most conservative       estimates (UK) were that 1 in every 250-370 people being treated with       NSAIDs would be hospitalised for ulcer complications each year       [Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf, 2001;10:13-19].
With at least a 10% death       rate, this resulted in an estimated societal burden of 3,500-4,000       admissions and 400-1,000 deaths per annum.
Estimates from other societies       and meta-analyses of clinical trials suggested greater harm, with annual       ulcer complication rates of 1 in 67 users, with two estimates of death       rates in the USA of 7,000-10,000 [Clin Ther 2010;32:667-677] and 16,500       [Gastroenterol, 1985;96,647-655].
Based on a Health Technology Appraisal (HTA) meta-analysis drawing on our       work [HTA 2006, 10(38); Am J Gastroenterol 2006,101:701-710] and studies       by others with other proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the NICE       Osteoarthritis Development Group reported in 2009 that use of PPIs in       patients aged 55 or over reduced the risk of hospitalisation for       gastrointestinal bleeding by 54% and symptomatic ulcer by 63%, and was the       most cost effective prophylactic strategya,b.
A pro rata       reduction in death could prevent between 216 and 540 deaths per annum in       the UK, with higher values if estimates from other countries are used.
Worldwide, NSAID use is extensive [PLoS Med 2013;10(2):e1001388].
Using       even the most conservative estimate above (1 hospitalisation per 370 users       per annum), several hundred thousand life-threatening ulcer complications       could be prevented annually, worldwide, by use of proton pump inhibitors.
Quality of Life:     As well as preventing ulcer complications, PPIs improve quality of life       by reducing dyspepsia and allowing continuation of treatment that would       otherwise be stopped.
NICE estimate dyspepsia rates between 5.4% and 9.6%       per annum in NSAID users and a 57% reduction with PPI co-prescriptiona,b.
Another meta analysis reported higher rates (13.5%-31%) with the 66%       reduction by PPIs being identified as the most effective available       treatment or preventative measure for NSAID dyspepsia [Am J Med;       2006:119(5):448.e27-36].
NICE estimate that the combined effect of reduced       mortality and improved quality of life results in a gain of 5-10 QALYs       (quality adjusted life years) per thousand people treateda,b.
[QALYs are a measure of disease burden used to assess the value of a       medical intervention.
They are based on the number and quality of years of       life that would be added by the intervention.
One QALY is one year spent       in perfect health.]
Healthcare costs:     NICE report that the ability of PPIs to prevent hospitalisation and other       adverse events reduces healthcare costs to the extent that their use       `increases the estimated gain in quality adjusted life years at little or       no additional cost" with "savings from not having to treat adverse       effects'.a     Guidelines:     These observations led NICE to recommend that PPIs are considered for use       in all patients taking NSAIDsa.
All other major guidelines       produced or updated in the past five years (Osteoarthritis Research       Society International [OARSI] 2008c, Cardiology 2008d,       American Colleges of Gastroenterology 2009e, and Rheumatology       2012f, place the PPI co-prescription strategy that we developed       at the heart of their guidelines, particularly for patients at increased       risk of ulcer complications.
An updated Cochrane analysisg       supports the strategy, as do other national and international       recommendations.
Prescribing practice: 	  To be effective, guidelines must be implemented.
Current data show progressive adoption of PPI co-prescription in UK (see       figure) and internationally [Am J Gastroenterol.
2008;103:1097-1103].
Clinical Practice Research Database Statisticsh show a rise in       co-prescription of a PPI in the UK from 27.6% in 2008 to 44.1% in 2012 in       patients aged &gt;45 using non-aspirin NSAIDs, resulting in safer symptom       relief.
During this time, aspirin use has doubled in the UK with a       concurrent rise in the proportion of patients receiving PPI protectionh       from 25.5% in 2008 to 34.8% in 2012, allowing patients to access the       cardiovascular and anti-cancer benefits of aspirin more safely.

Commercial Opportunities:     Esomeprazole is one of AstraZeneca's 10 leading medicines by sales.
Worldwide sales of this drug generated &#163;3.9 billioni in revenue       for AstraZeneca in 2012, with an increasingly significant contribution       from NSAID ulcer prophylaxis.
The effectiveness of PPI prescription has       also led to development of combination preparations, of which several have       so far been approved and launched internationally (Axorid: ketoprofen +       omeprazole 2009, Vimovo: naproxen + esomeprazole 2010, and Axanum: Aspirin       + esomeprazole:2011)j.
