     In this field, UK policy often lays the foundation for EU initiatives.
UKCGO and EU Kids Online are widely acknowledged as primary sources of       evidence for the multiple stakeholders working to improve children's       literacy and safety online.
UK policy impacts     Informed by the findings of UKCGO, the Department for Education's Home         Access Programme offered reduced-cost, safe computer and internet       access to the UK's poorest children (2007-11).
The UKCGO research       suggested that providing online access in disadvantaged families results       in educational benefits but that children's safety must also be addressed.
The research influenced the Byron Review (A), commissioned by       Prime Minister Brown.
Byron said, "I have approached classification of the       online risks to children...in line with a model developed by the EU Kids       Online project".
The research's benchmark findings broadened the risks       (cyber-bullying, `sexting' and privacy risks, as well as grooming by       paedophiles) addressed by successive awareness campaigns.
The Byron Review       led to the UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS), which produced       the UK's first Child Online Safety Strategy in 2011.
This reflects the       research's stress on balancing opportunities and risks and enhancing       digital literacy.
It led to the inclusion of e-safety in the school       computing curriculum and Ofsted inspection regime.
Efforts to empower children online in the UK gained impetus following the       success of the Home Secretary's Taskforce for Child Protection on the         Internet (2008).
The Taskforce established self- regulatory codes of       guidance on Safe Search, Chat, Moderation, Social Networking and Mobiles.
Updated by UKCCIS in 2010, this resulted in multiple safety improvements       in industry provision and practice, benefiting UK child internet users and       their families.
The codes (B) drew on the research's findings on       children's use of social networking sites, filtering and reporting tools,       and their practices of `friending', privacy, risk-taking and vulnerability       to harm.
Turning the strategy into action, UKCCIS' Advice on child internet         safety 1.0: Universal guidelines for providers (C) relied on the       research for its definitions and evidence of risk and harm.
UKCCIS members       (commercial fixed line, handset, software and content providers, police,       schools and NGOs) promote this user-friendly safety advice to UK children       and parents, along with technical and human support such as customer       services, reporting tools, privacy settings and helplines.
Livingstone's       research on the incidence of risk and gaps in parental mediation,       including parental struggles to install filters, informed the Internet       Service Providers' (UK fixed line) first Parental Controls Code of       Practice (D), signed by BT, Talk Talk, Virgin Media and Sky.
Endorsed by Prime Minister Cameron, domestic filters are now being turned       on unless the homeowner turns them off.
A key impact of the research was to change the terms of the public       debate, from panicky restrictions on children's internet use to       recognising children's rights online and awareness of the benefits of       active parental mediation.
Livingstone's public outreach has been       extensive.
National and international media reports of the research total       1800+, with Livingstone interviewed for the Daily Mail, Times,       Guardian, Der Spiegel, Huffington Post, Panorama,       Today, C4 News, GMTV Breakfast News, R4 Bringing         Up Britain, You and Yours, Woman's Hour, Sky News       and Newsnight.
She contributed to Safer Internet Day, which the       BBC estimates 10% UK population (14% of teens) heard in 2013, two thirds       of whom said they would change their online behaviour as a result.
www.saferinternet.org.uk/about/news/1-in-7-teens-heard-about-safer-internet-day-2013     Since 2008, Livingstone gave 90+ talks to non-academic audiences (e.g.
conferences for Head Teachers, Directors of Children's Services, police,       clinicians, industry and the public).
Some 40 non-academic reports and       writings were widely distributed: for example, in Digital Parenting         Magazine (1 million copies reached parents/schools in 2010-12),       YouTube interviews (several thousand views e.g.
"Child abuse on the       internet: risks and reality"; for UNICEF, viewed 1055 times).
The EU Kids       Online network counts five times as many talks and media mentions; report       downloads are 20,000+ since 2010, website visits total several hundred       thousand.
European/International policy impacts     EU Kids Online was closely involved in framing and evaluating new       industry self-regulation on social networking sites in 2009 (The Safer         Social Networking Principles for the EU) which resulted in higher       safety standards across the EU27.
Building on this successful initiative,       and citing EU Kids Online findings on how young children go online, EC       Vice President Kroes established a Coalition of industry CEOs to `make the       internet a better place for children.'
Livingstone presented the research       to the Coalition (Brussels, 2012: http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/44213/).
The Coalition confirmed implementation in 2013, citing EU Kids Online       findings (http://europa.eu/rapid/press-         release_MEMO-13-504_en.htm).The Coalition established higher       standards for parental controls, content classification, reporting tools,       privacy settings and elimination of child abuse images.
Following the EC's 2011 assessment (G) of child protection as part of the       Digital Agenda for Europe, a 2012 EC Communication established the first European         Strategy for a Better Internet for Children (D).
Both the assessment       and the Communication relied on the research's framework and findings for       children's internet uses and literacy.
This guided recent EU efforts to       empower children online through multiple literacy and safety initiatives.
For example, after EU Kids Online found that many children are       dissatisfied with available online content, notably in small language       countries, the EC Safer Internet Programme established the European         Award for Best Children's Online Content to promote online       opportunities for children (Livingstone chairs the European Jury).
Insafe       - the European Network of Awareness Centres - used the findings (e.g.
on       generational misunderstandings, digital skill gaps, emerging risks, needs       of young users) to target its efforts (e.g.
http://www.saferinternet.org/web/guest/digitaluniverse).
In the EC's `benchmarking of safer internet policies' (2013), the research       was identified as a major source for most member states and the sole       source of evidence in six (http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/creating-better-internet-kids).
In promoting online safety internationally, the OECD (E) cites the       research's "positive correlation between individual psycho-social and       socioeconomic circumstances and risky behaviour."
The International       Telecommunication Union developed its indicators and national strategy       guide (Child Online Protection) for 192 countries, noting "there       has been little work done in articulating a statistical framework.
The       main exception is the EU Kids Online Project."
The research was heavily       cited in Harvard's (2008) report to the Attorney Generals of the US, Enhancing         Child Safety and Online Technologies and is the mainstay of the       European evidence base for the Family Online Safety Institute's industry       resource, GRID.
Comparisons across place help tailor policy to the       cultural context: the EU Kids Online survey (5) was replicated in Brazil,       Russia and Australia, and adapted by UNICEF (F), GSMA, Ofcom, NSPCC, EC       Safer Internet Programme and others, being cited in policy and practice       documents in many countries.
Implementation     To ensure the policy and public benefits of the research, Livingstone       worked closely with numerous stakeholders, presenting findings to the All       Party Parliamentary Prevention of Suicide Group, British Chamber of       Commerce, Office of the Children's Commissioner, NSPCC, BECTA, BBC, Ofcom,       Inter-Ministerial Group on Violence against Women and Girls and diverse       companies (e.g.
Google, YouTube, BT, Vodafone, Facebook, GSMA).
UK: She served on the Home Secretary's Taskforce for Child         Protection on the Internet and the Dept.
for Education's Home         Access Programme (2009-10), and its panel, Assessing the impact         of the commercial world on children's wellbeing (2009).
Ofcom       commissioned her for its evidence for the Byron Review.
She gave       evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee (2008) whose       report led to UKCCIS (H).
Livingstone is the UKCCIS Evidence Champion,       Executive Board Member (2009-) and founding Evidence Group chair.
She is       on the Advisory Board, UK's Safer Internet Centre, and CEOP Command       Strategic Group (National Crime Agency).
EC/International: Livingstone led the EU Kids Online network in       advising national and European stakeholders - notably, UNICEF, ITU and       OECD - and presenting the research on multiple occasions at the EC's Safer       Internet Forum, European Commission, European Parliament, Swedish       Presidency of the EU, Insafe, Internet Governance Forum, Family Online       Safety Institute, World Summit on Media for Children and Youth, among       others.
