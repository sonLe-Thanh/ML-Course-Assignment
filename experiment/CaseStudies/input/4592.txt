     McGuirk's insights into the ways that cultural production has articulated       ideas and challenged accepted (partisan) opinion about the       Falklands-Malvinas war created channels for enhanced understanding of the       self, conflict, military identity, sovereignty, nationalism and political       discourse.
Specifically, it helped veterans begin a dialogue that would       lead to healing and reconciliation, and it helped to effect a broadening       in the political and cultural perspective underpinning Argentinian       diplomatic training and practice.
It has also influenced the approach to       reporting of two prominent journalists.
Contributing to processes of reconciliation and healing for veterans         of the Falklands/ Malvinas conflict     McGuirk's research has helped soldiers to overcome the battlefield trauma       they experienced during their involvement in the Falklands-Malvinas       conflict.
By bringing together veterans from both sides in mediated       encounters under the auspices of the ICSPRR (beginning in 2006 and       continuing through to 2013), dialogue was initiated that has led to a       sustained process of healing (subsequently continued through a veteran-led       online support forum and on-going meetings of the ICSPRR's veteran forum       the Grupo Nottingham/Malvinas) (5.1).
Discussions at ICSPRR       encounters built on McGuirk's research insights into the literary and       cultural representation of issues such as the nature of military identity,       the physical and mental traumas of war, and the nature of the nation and       sovereignty (3.1, 3.2, 3.4).
Reflecting on the impact of the work and regular meetings of the ICSPRR       between 2006 and 2012, a veteran Commander (Capit&#225;n de Fragata) of the       Argentine Navy commented that `McGuirk's research has helped change         many a mind of adult soldiers [sic] and bring them to consider each         other from a more humanized perspective.
Though this effect is       unwanted when at war, it is crucial to build a durable peace'.
A       journalist (ex-editor of the Soldier magazine) observed a veteran       come face to face with his old adversaries: `There's a picture of them       eyeing each other up and it was all very tense, but by the end everything       had thawed and they were talking as friends.'
A retired British Major and       veteran of the conflict commented that, after the sessions, soldiers         approached him to say how therapeutic it was and how it had helped them         get over events.
The President of the Argentine War Veterans       Association observes that the bringing together of former enemies: `...       probably represents one of the most important events regarding the       Malvinas issue.
Argentine military personnel and their British       counterparts met, saw each other's human dimension and found out what       really happened during the hand-to-hand bloody battles [...] To be         able to give a great hug to my erstwhile opposite number, with whom I         had previously only had written contact, was a most rewarding and         uplifting experience.'
One Argentine veteran describes the act of       bringing together ex-combatants to exchange experiences and points of       views as `revolutionary', and another says that `it helped me obtain a         broader view of the Malvinas-Falklands conflict and reconcile some         issues I struggled with.
More generally, Professor McGuirk's       research has helped me consider the Malvinas-Falklands conflict as a       possible spring-board for a better relation between Britain and Argentina       and has engaged my interest into areas that I would probably never have       considered' (5.2).
ICSPRR meetings are also attended by journa-lists,       academics, and doctors specialising in PTSD.
A Norwegian Psychiatrist and       Professor in traumatic stress (a world authority on the       psycho-traumatology and psychological support aspects of war) observed       after one meeting in 2012 that the veterans `obviously profited' from         the encounters (5.3).
The statements above illustrate how the work of the ICSPRR has contributed         decisively to processes of reconciliation, effectively filling the       gap left by the absence of official support mechanisms and infrastructure       for Falklands-Malvinas veterans in both the UK and Argentina.
It has       provided a sympathetic environment, enabling dialogue between         ex-soldiers from both sides.
The statements included above from key       military personnel involved in the conflict attest to the degree to which       the encounters helped them to reflect on and discuss their personal         experiences of the trauma of war in a way that moved them towards         personal reconciliation.
A retired British Major comments that `I       don't think you can put a price on the reconciliation of veterans.
War       isn't an impersonal thing to do, wounds run very deep and hatred runs very       deep, so to get people around the table and to get them engaging is         something extraordinary' (5.2).
The impact which McGuirk's research has had directly through the ICSPRR       has been amplified through the (subsequent) independent collaboration of       the veterans from both sides in the Grupo Nottingham/Malvinas.
Its regular meetings between veterans in the years since 2006 (on-going         after 2008) have led to significant amelioration of trauma and mental         problems.
Its online social media presence constitutes a sustainable       source of support for veterans and their families (5.4).
Influencing the understanding and perspectives of the Argentine         Ambassador     Complementing the work with veterans described above, McGuirk has       collaborated with H.E.
the Ambassador of the Republic of Argentina to the       Court of St James, and with the Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
For       this collaboration, McGuirk focused on the areas of his research which       alerted the Ambassador to post-82 debates and took her beyond the limited       political agendas of both nations.
He was able to bring to her attention       writers' and cartoonists' views of the conflict which challenged popular       and nationalistic positions and with which she was not familiar.
That       approach was aimed at broadening perspectives and shifting perceptions       about political discourse in both countries.
This research with its       balanced, non-partisan insights into the nature of the 1982 war (and its       political, cultural and psychological effects) has been warmly appreciated       by the Embassy and has influenced the Ambassador's approach to her         role in the UK: McGuirk was invited to brief her in the approach to       the thirtieth anniversary of the conflict in 2012 on both British and       international perspectives.
Subsequently, in May 2012, the Ambassador       attended a colloquium in Nottingham on Anglo-Argentine relations       1982-2012, at which she met Argentine and British veterans of the conflict       and Falkland Islanders.
That visit was followed by five reciprocal       invitations to McGuirk (2012-2013) to address Argentine and Latin American       diplomats and historians at the Argentine Embassy in London.
Her repeated       requests for briefings and her recommendation of McGuirk for a training       role with future Argentine diplomats indicates the degree to which she       values his understanding of the issues and the constructive potential in a       broad approach which goes beyond narrow political and ideological       interests.
The Ambassador was instrumental in the issuing of an invitation to       McGuirk to lead a course for the Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs'       National Institute of the Foreign Service to instruct trainee diplomats on       UK foreign policy and Anglo-Argentine reconciliation and post-conflict       reconstruction (Buenos Aires, April 2013).
Based on the success of this       initial encounter (5.5), he has been invited to return to lead another       such course, in collaboration with a fellow member of the ICSPRR (also       Chief Executive of Juniper Productions, former Director of political       programming at BBC TV, Member of the BBC Board of Governors): `Further to       the success of Professor McGuirk's acceptance of the Ambassador's proposal       that he visit and instruct the trainee diplomats at ISEN, at the       Chancellery in Buenos Aires, in Spring 2013, I am aware that another such       visit involving myself and Professor McGuirk is being considered by the       Embassy as an appropriate extension of the impact made by our respective       dealings with the Embassy since 2012.'
He adds that in his capacity as a       producer and director of television programmes and as a media specialist       whom McGuirk had introduced to the Ambassador, `I regularly consult with       [the Ambassador] and her fellow diplomats on these matters.
This on-going         involvement in a high-impact area in current Anglo-Argentine relations         stems in the first instance from the Embassy's awareness of McGuirk's         published research and up-to-the minute expertise in such matters       since the 1982 Falklands-Malvinas conflict and its reliance on his network       of specialist advisors in academe and the media' (5.6).
Providing new perspectives for broadcasters and journalists on war     Complementing this work with veterans and the Argentine Embassy,       McGuirk's research also influenced the approach of broadcasters and       journalists producing work on the Falklands-Malvinas conflict,       contributing to expanded perspectives for viewers and readers.
With a       worldwide readership and a monthly circulation in excess of 250,000, Soldier       is the official magazine of the British Army and was voted best internal       news magazine in Britain in 2008, 2009 &amp; 2010 (5.7).
Read extensively       by all ranks, the magazine has an annual feature on the conflict.
The       former editor of the publication has significant experience in reporting       defence and security issues, including working in operational theatres and       troubled areas of the world.
He says of the ICSPRR group: `It's changed         how I report, yes.
It's given me an insight into the complexities of         things, especially for something like the Falklands-Malvinas, with the         huge resonance that it has' (5.8).
Shah concurs: `Professor       McGuirk's research has been of great value in informing programming         ideas and proposals for documentary production.
His examination of       the Falklands-Malvinas conflict in terms of representation in the media,       in literature and other forms of expression has contributed to our own         coverage of the story in political programmes made by Juniper and in       documentary proposals put to the BBC and Channel 4' (5.6).
