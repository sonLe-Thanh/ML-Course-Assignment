     Background     Campylobacteriosis is the most common cause of human bacterial       gastroenteritis in the developed       world.
In most cases the effect on humans is limited to fever, diarrhoea,       and abdominal pain, with       the illness lasting between 2 and 10 days.
However more serious       complications, including       occasional deaths, can occur, particularly in young babies and the       elderly.
The mortality rate has       been estimated as 0.1% of reported cases.
Introduction of Code of Practice for the New Zealand Poultry Industry         (Oct 2007)     The New Zealand Food Safety Authority (NZFSA) has close links with       French's group at Massey,       and both they and the poultry industry were made aware of the findings of       the joint Massey-Lancaster       research on source attribution as they were happening.
The research led to       public       health professionals advocating more rigorous controls on foodborne       pathways of       campylobacteriosis, particularly for poultry, and in turn to the       introduction of a new code of practice       for the poultry industry.
Impact of the Code of Practice (Nov 2007 onwards)     This code of practice rapidly led to over a 50 percent reduction in the       number of reported cases of       campylobacter infection caused by food (from roughly 17,000 cases in 2006       to 8,000 in 2008 with       an initial reduction noted as early as November 2007).
This has been       maintained to the present       data.
With notification rates often estimated at around 1 in 10 (Duncan       2011), this corresponds to       around 90,000 fewer actual cases per year, and given estimated mortality       rates, to a saving of       about 50 lives during the census period.
The annual economic saving, including direct health costs and loss of       output, has been estimated       to be in the region of NZ$36M (http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/elibrary/industry/Zealand_Leads-Efforts_Drastically.htm) to NZ$50M (Duncan 2011).
Over the REF       census period this corresponds       to a total saving in region of &#163;100M to &#163;150M.
The method for source attribution is still used in New Zealand to monitor       the effectiveness of the       change of policy in an ongoing surveillance programme (French 2013).
Evidence of the Role of the Underpinning Research on Impact     The role the underpinning research had on the introduction of the new       code of practice is       evidenced by a number of sources.
Firstly, Mullner et al.
(2009) state "The         evidence provided by         our approach has supported national policy making by providing an         important contribution to the         NZFSA Campylobacter Risk Management Strategy".
The introduction to       the NZFSA       Campylobacter Risk Management Strategy states "It has been         scientifically established that poultry         meat is a primary exposure pathway in New Zealand", a conclusion       that comes from the Massey-       Lancaster research.
And this fact is used to motivate the resulting       strategy for reducing       campylobacter levels in poultry.
Two editorials (Dixon 2009a,b) also highlight that the Massey-Lancaster       research led by French,       and in particular that the use of the modelling methodology of Wilson, was       central to change in       policy.
For example, Dixon 2009b states that this "modelling         methodology provided the clinching         evidence to influence an industry highly resistant to any suggestions         that chickens were the major         source of campylobacteriosis in the country."
Dixon (2009a) adds "..in         New Zealand .... cases of         campylobacteriosis have halved over the past year.
This has been done by         the adoption of new         hygiene measures by a poultry industry initially hostile to the idea         that it was the major source of         the problem &#8212; after their necessity had been established by         sophisticated computer modelling of         the infection."
A recent presentation at the NZAE Annual Conference       (Duncan 2011) also states "It         was this study conducted by Massey University for NZFSA ... that         motivated the poultry industry to         begin investing to reduce the Campylobacter loading on product for sale         for human consumption."
The work of the group at Massey, to which Wilson contributed, is cited in       NZFSA reports on risk       management strategies for campylobacter.
(For example, French 2009 is       cited by in the NZFSA's       Campylobacter Risk Management Strategies 2010-2013).
French himself writes       that "The         contribution to public health made by Dr Wilson and colleagues at         Lancaster University should not         be underestimated."
