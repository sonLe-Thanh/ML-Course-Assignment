     Control of C. difficile.
The immediate impact of       the research was to inform changes to healthcare practices in NHS         Lothian medicine-for-the-elderly wards which served to reduce the       incidence of C. difficile, with consequent improvements in patient       outcomes.
A control strategy, based on control of broad-spectrum       antibiotic prescribing and informed by the mathematical models, was       identified and implemented in a 12-month pilot study from November 2007       across seven medicine-for-the-elderly wards in Edinburgh hospitals.
During       the pilot study there were a total of 60 cases of C. difficile       infection in the wards, compared to 120 during the previous 12 months.
Following this initial success, and other pilot studies, a tool-kit of       measures was rolled out across all acute wards in Lothian (the 2nd       largest NHS region in Scotland) in September 2008.
The NHS Lothian       consultant who led the pilot study has indicated that `the mathematical       and statistical models were key to providing the quantitative evidence       necessary to justify the approach taken in the pilot studies' [7].
Following the introduction of the toolkit of measures, the incidence of C.         difficile declined considerably.
Monthly median incidence in Lothian       during the 15 months from Jan 2007 &#8212; March 2008, was 106 cases per month.
During the 24 months from April 2008 &#8212; March 2010, the monthly median       incidence was 61 cases per month [9,10].
A more recent estimate of the       impact of the control measures can be found in the summary document NHS       Lothian at a Glance HEAT 2011-12 Target Performance [11] which notes the       `significant progress in reducing the rate of C. difficile       infections' and that `Year-end rates for new cases represented a reduction       of 74% compared to 2007-8'.
As well as the beneficial changes to clinical practices, disease       prevention, and patient health outcome, reduction in mortality and       morbidity, the research has contributed to substantial economic benefits.
The management of each clinical case of C. difficile infection was       estimated to cost &#163;4k in 2000.
Thus, a 74% reduction from monthly median       levels of the order of 100 cases per month represents &#8212; not accounting for       cost inflation &#8212; a reduction of monthly costs of the order of &#163;300k       translating to annual reductions of around &#163;3.5M.
Moreover, there is the       `opportunity-cost' benefit that increased infection-control resources can       now be targeted at other pathogens, such as norovirus, or other healthcare       issues.
The impact been extended from Lothian to the whole of Scotland       with the adoption of measures to control antimicrobial prescribing by NHS       Scotland [8] and a proportionate reduction in C. difficile       infection levels has been seen.
Control of arboreal pathogens.
The spatio-temporal       parameter-estimation techniques [4-6] were adopted by the epidemiology       group at Cambridge in a major initiative to develop a spatio-temporal       modelling toolbox that could be applied to a wide variety of plant       diseases [12].
This group was approached by Defra and US         Department of Agriculture (USDA) to apply the toolbox to a range of       emerging plant pathogens, including sudden oak death, a devastating       disease that is threatening woodlands in California and woodlands and       heathlands in the UK, and whose host range includes more than 100       economically and ecologically important woody hosts.
In the Californian       context, models parameterised using the methods [4-6] were employed to       demonstrate the value of early action in detecting and controlling       disease, to determine the regions of the state at greatest risk up to       2030, and to demonstrate that creating barriers by removing large areas of       vegetation is unlikely to work.
More widely, they have been used to inform       US policy advisers and policy makers about the risks of spread of sudden       oak death in Eastern states of the US [13].
In the UK, The Forestry Commission and Defra are using       the models to inform, adjust and implement sampling and disease control       policies for sudden oak death throughout England and Wales as part of a       &#163;25M eradication and control scheme launched in 2010 [14].
Specifically       the models formulated by the Cambridge group since 2008 allow comparison       of different `what-if' scenarios about the likelihood of disease spread       and are providing policy makers with information about the likely efficacy       of different culling distances and sampling frequencies, and to guide       aerial and ground surveys for the disease, using `hazard maps' predicted       by the parameterised models.
The insights on sudden oak dynamics from the       US setting &#8212; such as the structure of appropriate models for pathogen       dispersal and the parameter ranges &#8212; obtained using the parameter       estimation method of [4-6], were utilised directly in the initial       modelling studies of the UK sudden oak death epidemic, and helped to       underpin the subsequent advice to policy makers [14].
