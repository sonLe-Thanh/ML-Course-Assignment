     Created through sustained collaborative research, Storey's work bridges       the gap between science and the public.
In an essay commissioned for the       Wellcome Trust's 75th Anniversary and commenting on Storey's overall body       of work, Marek Kohn writes `by showing that an individual can make         designs without just being a designer, create art without really being         an artist, and engage with science without being a scientist, she         [Storey] shows that weaving it all together is an art that can be         mastered'.
Reach and significance of impact is evidenced by the       numerous exhibitions, funding attracted, educational outreach activities,       wide coverage by broadcast, print and new media, and external recognition.
The ability of the projects' creative outcomes to communicate and engage       with diverse audiences is further demonstrated by invitations to       participate in major science festivals, and through partnership with       scientific organisations.
An indication of Primitive Streak's significance and longevity is       that it received a second Wellcome Trust award over a decade after its       initiation, resulting in an expansion of the research, the creation of new       pieces (Lung Dresses) and a film (Breathe), the development       of a website, and a new tour.
Primitive Streak featured       prominently in the Wellcome Trust's 75th Anniversary celebrations in 2011.
In addition to the commissioned essay referred to above (one of a series       of 14 featuring people who have been significant in the Trust's history),         White Lung Dress and Breathe were exhibited at the Wellcome       Collection; and an overview of Primitive Streak was given to       preface the debate Because we're worth it: in an age of austerity we         ask how best to nurture art and science (chaired by Sir John Tusa).
Primitive Streak also featured in the exhibition Henry's Legacy,       highlighting some of the Trust's major achievements.
In March 2011 Helen       and Kate Storey were invited to discuss Primitive Streak on Radio       4's Woman's Hour (average of 3.8 million listeners).
Primitive Streak       has had a powerful influence in the field of Science/Art collaborations       with Ken Arnold, Head of Public Programmes at the Wellcome Collection       stating; `this project has become something of an emblem of just what         can be achieved in this area &#8212; extraordinary work, high educational         value and enormous international coverage.
I can think of no project         that we have been involved with that more clearly illustrates how great         research can with skill and imagination go on to have profound public         impact &#8212; not only with the specific topic it focuses upon but in terms         of the whole practice of bringing arts and sciences together.
Our very         positive experience of funding that initial project [...]helped         encourage us to carry on in this innovative funding area and to base         some of our programming in Wellcome Collection on that interdisciplinary         premise.'
Wonderland opened as an installation at the London College of       Fashion, UAL, later touring to Sheffield where it appeared at four       different sites across the city, then continuing to Ormeau Baths Gallery,       Belfast (2008).
Say Goodbye featured in Aware: Art Fashion         Identity, Royal Academy (2010), later exhibited as part of       Futurotextiles3 touring to six European venues.
A core aim of Wonderland       was that it should suggest educational projects and events that explored       cross-disciplinary working.
Activities included a CPD days for       educationalists and teachers (2008); Mystical Tour of Wonderland       (2008) with school children touring the Sheffield exhibition sites; Wonderland:         The Science Behind the Story (2008) where 85 children participated       in a full day of activities at the University of Sheffield; and events in       Belfast including Interface Masterclass (2008) demonstrating       processes involved in creating the Disappearing Dresses.
The       project had a dedicated education micro-site illustrating Wonderland's       educational activities, giving lesson plans and related information on       events and workshops.
Broadcast and media highlights for Wonderland       during 2008 included: My Chemical Romance article by Storey,       Vogue; Triggering the future, i-D Magazine; Environment Weekly         Podcast, The Guardian; and Material World, BBC Radio 4.
An       indicator of the significance of the work is given by external support       extended to the project, with Wonderland receiving sponsorship       from Sainsbury's and support from Arts Council England, Arts Council       Northern Ireland, Sheffield City Council, and Arts and Business.
Nick       Knight and SHOWstudio created film and a series of images for Wonderland       and the project is now archived on SHOWstudio.com where it is       described as a `ground-breaking collaboration'.
Catalytic Clothing's creative outputs, in the form of fashion and       textile installations and films, have provided a successful vehicle for       public engagement.
The project's viral campaign gives evidence of its       global reach.
A film, directed with Adam Mufti, featuring Erin O'Connor       and with a soundtrack by Radiohead, was developed as part of the project.
On June 8 2011 a short teaser was distributed to a network of bloggers,       trade forecasters and design networks.
A week later the full version of       the film was released and spread via the web and media across outlets with       a potential audience of 300 million.
A new media/digital tool, Living         Map, was created to visually illustrate CatClo-related       communications on social media, blog, editorial and broadcast media (http://www.catalytic-         clothing.org/livingmap.html).
The project has received widespread       media coverage including: BBC Radio 4 Material World and Costing         the Earth reaching an estimated 2.5 million listeners; AFP (Agence       France-Presse) and AP (Associated Press) producing films screened on China       TV and Euronews; BBC Radio One Newsbeat (potential audience of       more than 11 million); and Daily Mail online (4.3 million unique visitors       daily).
Additional examples include: BBC Breakfast &#8212; Blue jeans to         help the environment?
; CBBC Newsround &#8212; Washing powder helps         jeans to clean air; The Independent &#8212; Does my bum look         big in my catalytic converter?
; and Discovery News - Rinse cycle         turns clothing into pollution busters.
After taking Catalytic         Clothing to Moscow in 2011, interviews with Storey and Ryan and the       Catalytic Clothing film, were shown on three major television       networks (potential audience of 173 million).
A comprehensive public programme has seen Catalytic Clothing       showcased at numerous events, with installations and films being vital in       engaging the public with the technology.
As well as the Erin O'Connor       film, an animated feature, The Catalytic Clothing Story, was       produced supported by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, aimed at       a non-scientific general audience.
An indicator of significance is given       by Catalytic Clothing featuring within the programming of       prestigious science festivals including: London Science Festival (2011),       Manchester Science Festival (2012), Newcastle and Durham Science Festival       (2012), and Edinburgh International Science Festival (2012).
The Deputy       Director of the Edinburgh Science Festival describes Storey and Ryan as `a         rare example of a genuine Art/Science collaboration'.
The London       Science Festival Field of Jeans was supported by The Royal Society       of Chemistry (RSC), which also publicizes Catalytic Clothing on       their website.
Overseas events include: Catalytic Clothing in Hello         Materials at the Danish Design Centre, Copenhagen (2012); at the World         Environment Day Festival, Queensland (2012); and aspects of Catalytic         Clothing touring Europe as part of the Futurotextiles3       (2012/2013).
Additional indicators of significance include Catalytic         Clothing as joint winner of the Cond&#233; Nast Traveller Innovation       &amp; Design Award 2012 (Sustainability) alongside Vivienne Westwood's       Cool Earth project, and Storey's selection for The Telegraph's       Amazing 15 (15 people who represent Britain's most exciting talent), based       on her contribution to Catalytic Clothing.
The project has brought the potential of the technology to the attention       of industry.
Ecover have given valuable financial investment in both the       science and cultural side of the project and on its website states: `Every         so often, we hear about a pioneering project that really gets us         excited.
Catalytic Clothing is one of those projects [...] we've been         working together to discover ways in which Ecover can utilize the         catalytic compound.'
The Catalytic Clothing concept is now       with the R&amp;D department of one of the world's largest laundry product       producers, who are considering how air purification technology might be       brought to market.
