     Impact of Newcastle research on patient survival and quality of life       The drug has led to a near doubling of patient survival rate (R3), which       was reported in two national and European guidelines.
In 2010, the       European Society for Medical Oncology published Clinical Practice       Guidelines (EV a) that include R1 and R2, stating, "The update of the         IRIS study has confirmed and extended the earlier results, reporting a         progression-free survival of 84% and an overall survival of 88% after 6         years."
These results are also reported in NICE Technology Appraisal 251 (EV b),       which states: "Standard-dose imatinib is associated with improved         survival, with the latest results of the follow-up of the IRIS         (International Randomised Study of Interferon versus STI571) trial         (8-year follow-up) [R3] showing overall survival of 85%.
After         the introduction of imatinib into routine clinical practice, 5-year         relative survival increased from 27.1% in 1990-92 to 48.7% in 2002-04,         for all age groups combined (p&lt;0.0001)".
A January 2013 report from the National Cancer Intelligence Network (EV       c) showed that deaths from CML in men reduced from 163 in 2001-2003 to 105       in 2006-2008.
This report confirms that the increase in survival is due to       the introduction of imatinib: "The improvement in prognosis seen is due         to the introduction of a new drug &#8212; Imatinib which was being used         increasingly to treat patients with CML."
According to a 2011 study (EV d), imatinib is well-tolerated and has few       side-effects.
This study used the cancer-specific questionnaire FACT-BRM       (functional assessment of cancer therapy-biologic response modifiers) to       assess patient quality of life, including physical function and       well-being.
The mean score increased significantly from 75.5 at baseline       to 85.2 at six months, where an increase of &gt;5 represents a clinically       significant improvement.
Scores for fatigue, emotional and cognitive       dysfunction and side effects all decreased significantly from baseline to       six months.
Impact of Newcastle research on guidelines       The use of imatinib is recommended in two European guidelines and UK-wide       NICE guidelines.
Clinical Practice Guidelines from 2010 (EV a), published       by the European Society for Medical Oncology, (ESMO) state "On the         basis of a randomized trial of imatinib... (IRIS study, [R1, 2]), imatinib         400 mg daily has been established as standard, frontline treatment of         all patients with CP CML."
The updated ESMO guidelines from 2012 (EV       e) directly cite R1 and R2 as two of the "high quality reports of phase         2 and phase 3 studies, single-arm, and randomized, that have been         published in peer-reviewed journals over the last 10 years" that       inform the guidelines: of these, R1 was the first to be published.
These       guidelines recommend imatinib, stating "Imatinib was the first TKI to         be used and is still the gold standard of first-line treatment         worldwide."
Imatinib is recommended in NICE Technical Appraisal 251 (EV f), published       in April 2012.
The evidence that informs this report includes two papers       (Saglio et al., DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa0912614 and Kantarjian et         al.
DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1002315 both 2010 N Eng J Med) that       are based on Newcastle research: the former cites R2, and the latter cites       both R1 and R2.
The Technical Appraisal states:            "...the progression of CML can be slowed by imatinib.
Imatinib           produces high rates of remission in the chronic phase."
(pg 3)       "The primary outcome was complete cytogenetic response within 12           months."
(pg 10)       "The primary outcome was major molecular response at 12 months.
Secondary outcomes included complete cytogenetic response by 12           months."
(pg 11, from Saglio et al.)
"Standard-dose imatinib is recommended as an option for the           first-line treatment of adults with chronic phase           Philadelphia-chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML),"         (pg 53, from Kantjarian et al.)
In summary, Newcastle research found that imatinib had a higher       cytogenetic response and was better tolerated than the previous standard       of care.
This work almost doubled five-year survival rates, improved       patient quality of life and adoption of the drug into guidelines.
