     Impacts from this work: founding and influencing the work of         charities, public awareness and attitudes, use of research findings by         clinical practitioners            Enhanced public awareness of a health risk (Outreach and engagement           with parents &amp; public directly, through the NHS Trust and through           the media)       The awareness, attitudes and understanding of (sections of) the public         have been informed, and their ability to make informed decisions on         issues improved, by engaging them with research (as above)       Practitioners have used research findings in the conduct of their work         (influencing approach taken by clinicians)       The work of an charitable organisation has been influenced by the         research (including foundation of a charity, with &#163;1.5M funding)          The need     Half of all burn injuries occur in children under 16 years old, mostly by       scalds from hot tea, coffee and bath water.
In 2010-2011 the South West UK       Children's Burn Centre at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol (an NHS Regional       Centre with a 10 million population catchment area), the main clinical       partner in this study, treated more than 700 children for serious burn       injuries.
Around 10% of children who are burned become infected, which       increases the likelihood of scarring and disfigurement and in some cases       can even cause death.
The problem is obtaining clarity in diagnosis, and       the dressing being developed at Bath provides quick evidence of infection       without need to remove the dressing, informing clinical decision making.
Engaging and Influencing Clinicians and Clinical Research     The development of responsive wound dressings suitable for implementation       in the clinical environment is a partnership with the clinical community.
The key direct clinical collaborator is Dr Amber Young, Consultant       Paediatric Anaesthetist, lead for South-West Burns Unit at Frenchay       Hospital, but the impact of the work has also been manifest in the reach       into the mainstream clinical practice community.
The concept of using such       responsive sensors, based on technology being patented by Bath Chemistry       [A] has also led to substantial influence and attitude changing in the       broader clinical community.
Jenkins is a regular speaker at clinical       forums, and is a passionate advocate for the role of these advanced       chemistry solutions in saving lives of vulnerable patients.
It is       extremely unusual for core chemists to be invited into such forums, but       Jenkins is now a regular invited participant at high profile and       influential clinical events, for example, the only chemistry plenary       speaker at the International Society for Burns Injuries in September 2012,       a large forum of 1250+ practising nurses and doctors investigating the       latest methods of clinical practice.
The high degree of awareness raising       that Jenkins has managed to achieve is emphasised by his impact at such       events, where "his work had a real "eye-opening" effect in challenging         current clinical practice and offering alternative solutions" [B].
This is augmented by ongoing interactions with healthcare professionals in       the British Burns Association and elsewhere.
This raising of awareness and       changing attitudes towards the potential of a system that would aid       clarity of diagnosis and ease of treatment, has engaged clinicians in this       debate.
The research has also made a major contribution to the founding of a       charity, the Healing Foundation Children's Burns Research Centre [C;       Jenkins lead academic in the "Clinical Management" theme].
The Bath         research has been used directly to secure at least &#163;1.5M charitable         funding for the new Centre [B].
Prototype testing and clinical development     The development of prototype dressings has been carried out through       initial ex vivo porcine testing and pre-clinical trials at the       Blonde-McIndoe Research Foundation, one of the leading charities funding       clinical work in the remediation of burns injuries, who quote that "A real       need therefore exists to develop novel ways to detect and treat burn wound       infections, and we are working with collaborators at the University of       Bath and South West Children's Burns Centre, Frenchay Hospital, Bristol to       develop innovative ways of monitoring infection" [D].
The manufacturing of       prototype wound dressings has also been established with industry partners       (M&#246;lnycke AB Healthcare (Sweden), Hartmann AG (Germany) and Altrika Ltd       (UK)), translating the research into a viable candidate technology.
In       addition to prototyping, the group are pursuing follow-on implementation       studies, with publication in clinical journals, establishing a high degree       of clinical involvement and `buy in' at this early stage, to ensure rapid       clinical take up of the product when manufactured [E].
Initial direct         clinical use has also been demonstrated &#8212; having been adopted within       an NIHR portfolio project [C], an initial cohort of six patients has been       recruited and used for research-led clinical trials of the effect of burn       and blister exudates on the Bath-developed prototype wound dressings.
This       was carried out by a charity-funded clinical research nurse whose funding       resulted from the Bath Chemistry research, providing vital clinical       information towards wider trialling.
Community and Media, Raising Awareness and Changing Behaviour     The Bath research has been instrumental in raising the profile of this       area.
By offering a potentially radical solution to many of the issues of       diagnosis, it has focused wide attention on the issue of children's burns       in the region, impacting on education, awareness and attitude changing       amongst the directly concerned community &#8212; the patients, represented by       parents and carers of infant burns victims or potential burns victims and       amongst clinical practitioners: "it is no exaggeration to say that         exposure to this research has changed the way in which I think about the         considerable clinical issues in this challenging area" [B].
In       partnership with the South West Children's Burns Centre and the Healing       Foundation Children's Burns Research Centre, Jenkins and his work have       been effectively used as a vehicle for publicising the risks of apparently       innocuous, small volumes of hot liquids to small children [F].
This has       enabled the development of an educated community of hundreds of       adults, and of educating children in the risks, through programmes       of school visits.
The patients involved represent a group whose injuries stir strong       emotions and sympathy in the general public.
Through a concerted effort       led by Jenkins and Young, a "star patient" (Isambard, who fortunately made       a full recovery from his dreadful burns injuries) has been used as an       immediately identifiable vehicle for education, awareness-raising and to       motivate researchers, clinicians and fund-raisers, through his clinical       case study:     Isambard was a 2 year old child who knocked a cup of hot tea over         himself, causing 32% total body surface area burns (partial thickness).
He was airlifted to Frenchay hospital and treated.
Two days post burn he         became very pyrexic and non-specifically unwell.
Infection was suspected         and he was brought into the OR.
In the OR a `lively' discussion between         the clinicians took place: should he be treated aggressively, removing         his dressings &#8212; potentially saving his life but guaranteeing life-long         scarring, or treated conservatively, leave dressings on and watch and         wait.
In the event the latter approach was used &#8212; with a very good         outcome, but the decision was not informed by clinical           knowledge     The work has had impact far beyond the usual dissemination and has a very       strong outreach element [G].
This has included articles in magazines such       as New Scientist, and still more widespread reach and impact in mass       media, on television and radio, and in national newspapers and news       outlets (e.g.
the Daily Mail and BBC).
In addition the BBC recently filmed       in Jenkins' laboratory, as part of a major piece in the popular, wide       reach television programme "Bang Goes the Theory" [H], which regularly       attracts total audiences of around 4 million, on the dangers of hot       drinks, children's burns and newly developed treatments for those injured       in this way.
