     [text removed for publication] and [text removed for publication] have       both produced a new range of functional clothing for the active ageing       based on research by CSRI and the DFAW project.
In addition, [text removed       for publication] has been guided by CSRI's research in the re-design of       their [text removed for publication] product [text removed for       publication] to facilitate integration within functional clothing for use       by the active ageing.
Results from CSRI's research conducted within DFAW [E1] have been used by       the wearable technology providers [text removed for publication] and [text       removed for publication] [E2].
[text removed for publication] have       improved their knowledge of electrode positioning for physiological       monitoring [3, 5] (2008-2012).
[text removed for publication] have used       CSRI's research, and analysis of feedback from the user group of active       older persons in DFAW, to reconfigure the [text removed for publication]       in their [text removed for publication] product to control mobile-based       applications and to redesign the switch component "to improve the size and       positioning of the [text removed for publication] (to allow) for the       reduced dexterity of older users" (2008-2012) [E2].
The co-design process, one of the central results from DFAW [E1]       (2008-2012), was used as a methodology to produce a range of       age-appropriate clothing with integrated technologies.
These garments were       demonstrated at [text removed for publication] in a joint exhibition with       [text removed for publication] [E1].
[text removed for publication] have       incorporated the research results into their current range of clothing       relating to age-appropriate shape and fit, styling and fabric selection.
The recommendations from DFAW have also guided [text removed for       publication] in the design of the garment layering system as a basis for       incorporating wearable electronics [E3].
These recommendations relate to       CSRI's research findings for the most appropriate positioning of sensor       and control technologies within the garments in order to both maximise       usability from an active ageing perspective and to improve the accuracy of       the physiological measurements processed from the data acquired by the       sensors (ECG, and measurements of levels of activity) [4, 5, 6].
[text removed for publication], a niche outdoor clothing manufacturer,       have adapted their manufacturing procedures to support the incorporation       of technology within smart garments [E4] (2012) in relation to the optimal       positioning of the technology and how the technology is encapsulated       within the garment during the assembly process.
This change in       manufacturing practice is based on [text removed for publication]       involvement in DFAW, particularly the garment manufacturing methodology       produced by the project and [text removed for publication] experience of       working with DFAW's multidisciplinary research team in the production of       prototype garments.
A feature presented by [text removed for publication]       during 2012 demonstrated how the manufacturing process had been adapted       within [text removed for publication] and how the company was now able to       incorporate wearable technologies from DFAW into their garments [E5].
Engagement with users from walking groups has resulted in a series of       testimonials that report the positive experiences of active older persons       who have used the new clothing for outdoor activities.
A 70-year-old       participant in the evaluations, who reported that she enjoyed walking as       part of an active life, stated that her involvement in DFAW has resulted       in her being "more inclined to go out and exercise" and that she was now       "more aware of the options" available for technology-enabled       age-appropriate clothing [E6].
A 67-year-old male who was a member of a       walking group reported that in his opinion the use of age-appropriate       clothing (as evaluated as part of DFAW) would make people "more likely to       become involved in recreational activities" [E6].
The research expertise developed by CSRI in wearable technologies [3, 5,       6] is further recognised through influencing definitions of new       terminology that are used in standards within the textile industry.
The       Textile Institute, a worldwide organisation for textiles, clothing and       footwear, recognised the importance of "smart textiles".
In revising their       publication "Textile Terms and Definitions" (TT&amp;D) in 2012, the       Institute wished to reflect the importance of the emerging "smart textile"       sector through its inclusion in the revised version [E8].
In 2012 Prof       Nugent was invited by the Textile Institute to join a committee of 12       international experts from the smart textiles community, from both       academia and industry, to assist in the revision of the TT&amp;D       publication [E9].
(Nugent was one of two technology expert members on the       committee.)
The output from the committee is a new set of terms and       definitions relating to smart textiles from design, technology and       clothing perspectives that were not addressed previously in the Textile       Institute's TT&amp;D publication.
This work can be associated in part with a collaboration with Professor       Jane McCann (University of South Wales, Newport), project co-ordinator of       the DFAW project.
CSRI were the technology co- ordinators of the DFAW       consortium, and the work on incorporating wearable technologies into smart       garments for the active ageing was conducted by CSRI.
Subsequently ESRC       has indicated that they wish to highlight the results from the DFAW       project as one of their selected Impact Case Studies [E1, E9].
