              The main impact of the research is the improved understanding of         barriers and enablers to female career progression and the influence on         the gender equality policy agenda and public debate.
The Scottish         Government drew upon the commissioned final research report, to         formulate gender equality policy for Scotland.
This impact, the         influence on the policy agenda, is evidenced in the Scottish Government         (2010) policy document.
In the further and higher education sectors the research informed         colleges and universities on gender equality; barriers and enablers to         career progression of female staff; and the Gender Equality Duty, which         is a legal requirement on all public authorities to pay due regard to         eliminate unlawful discrimination and harassment on the grounds of sex,         and promote equality of opportunity between women and men in         policy-making, decision-making, service provision, employment matters,         and statutory discretion.
The research informed the Leadership         Foundation for Higher Education's Diversity Strategy for 2007-2012;         greater awareness of gender inequality in the education sector (see LFHE         In Practice, Issue 9); and stimulated public debate of the enablers and         barriers to female career progression within the education sector.
This         was achieved through a series of presentations of research findings to         members of the Association of Scottish Colleges; Universities Scotland,         and the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education; and broader         dissemination through media for example by the Times Higher Education         Supplement which publicised the research in an article on 30 July 2009         that stimulated reader comments via blogs and twitter.
A further impact of the research was the support to public sector         organisations, as participants in the research, in preparation for the         implementation of the Gender Equality Duty.
The organisations included         NHS Health Boards; Royal College of Nursing; Royal College of Physicians         and Surgeons; Police; Fire Services; colleges; universities; Scottish         Government, Association of Scottish Colleges; Chartered Institute for         Secretaries and Administrators; Equality Opportunities Commission; and         Office for the Commissioner of Public Appointments.
For example, the         workforce audit conducted for the organisations provided a benchmark of         the representation of female staff at various levels of the         organisations, which was not undertaken before, and provided data to         meet the regulatory requirements of the Gender Equality Duty.
The research stimulated the debate and created awareness beyond         Scotland.
The research findings were included in other projects e.g.
in         a major research study on the NHS in England (see UK NHS Midland and         East 'Releasing Potential: Women Doctors and Clinical Leadership' by P.         Newman).
The research also informed the UK Commission for Employment and         Skills by providing evidence for its policy documents on gender         occupational discrimination and segregation (see https://intelligence.ukces.org.uk/Pages/Articles.aspx?RelArticleID=398&amp;Keywords=22~29~55~90~98).
Beyond the UK, the research was included in other policy documents such         as the major trans-European research project entitled, 'Meta-Analysis of         Gender Science Research, Topic Report:Horizontal and Vertical         Segregation' by F. Sagebiel and S. Vazquez-Cupeiro (2010) as         commissioned by the European Commission (EU Project RTD-PP-L4-2007-1);         and The Council for European Studies, Montreal, Canada, 'New Blood: The         Interaction of Enlargement and Gender in the Changing Composition of the         European Commission Staff' (2010).
Importantly, the United Nations         Development Programme adopted the research by Miller and McTavish on the         representation of women in the public sector in a presentation of Gender         and Public Administration by Soma Chakrabarti Fezzardi the UNDP         consultant for Gender Equality in Public Administration (GEPA) (see http://www.slideshare.net/undpeuropeandcis/gender-equality-in-the-public-administration-gepa)           based on Miller and McTavish (2011).
