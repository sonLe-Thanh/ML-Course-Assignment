     Research at Southampton that gave rise to a unique high-throughput       solid-state synthesis methodology, has led to the creation of a dynamic       spin-out company, Ilika Technologies plc [5.1].
The company has       accelerated the development of the clean technologies of the future, in       collaboration with leading multinationals, and boosted the global       competitiveness of the UK economy.
Based on Southampton's patented       methodology [Section 3], Ilika's work is focused on next-generation       applications for the high-growth industries of clean energy and       electronics, driving forward innovation to reduce reliance on the world's       diminishing supply of hydrocarbon fuels and cutting carbon emissions.
Clean technology: Governments have introduced incentives to       stimulate the development of electric vehicles (EVs), but mass-market       roll-out is being hindered by inadequate battery performance.
Ilika's       technology, which allows rapid synthesis and screening of new cell       chemistries, has increased the energy capacity and charge rates of solid         state lithium-ion batteries, a market set to be worth $32 billion a       year by 2018.
In a significant collaboration with Toyota, who since 2008       have invested ~&#163;4 million revenue directly into this research [5.1,         5.2], Ilika has also filed 9 patents in the period 2008-13 to       facilitate further advances in EV through the creation of new battery       materials and compositions [5.3].
These are being integrated into       batteries for future generations of Toyota's hybrid vehicles, also       offering very significant safety benefits over liquid electrolyte       batteries.
Reducing catalyst materials costs is a key driver in delivering       Toyota's vision for fuel cell hybrid vehicle roll-out.
Mr Taniguchi       (Toyota) states, "Ilika's fuel cell catalyst formulation is key to           Toyota's strategy for cost reduction", while according to Mr       Okajima (Project Manager, Toyota's Frontiers &amp; Advanced Engineering       Strategy Department, R&amp;D Management Centre, Japan), "Ilika's           high through-put techniques are essential to overcome some of the           technological barriers we face in the development of leading-edge           technologies" [5.4, 5.5].
Ilika has also made an       impact in other areas of the automotive industry, working with CeramTec to       develop more environmentally-friendly lead-free piezoelectrics in sensors       and actuators used for triggering airbags and in fuel injection systems.
These are now in use in several German automotive vehicle brands [5.4].
The International Energy Agency estimates that by 2020 hydrogen fuel cell       vehicles will be responsible for 10% of the new car market, achieving an 8       million tonne reduction in UK CO2 emissions between 2010-2020.
The prohibitive cost of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells has       hindered the growth of this industry.
Ilika has worked with Japanese       chemicals and materials company Asahi Kasei to develop unique palladium       alloy (Pd/Co/W) electrocatalysts [5.1] which are ~70% cheaper than       `standard' platinum catalysts, making the market penetration of fuel cell       vehicles more viable.
Ilika has been awarded 3 Carbon Trust Grants to take       this work forward (total: ~&#163;438k), plus &#163;150k equity investment in 2012 [5.1,         5.6].
The future of hydrogen as an energy source is very dependent on the       ability to store it safely.
Current solutions consume large amounts of       energy and raise safety concerns.
Ilika worked with Shell to develop a       solid metal hydride [5.1, 5.3, 5.4], which is currently being       scaled-up and commercialised with Sigma Aldrich, a US-based specialist       chemicals company.
Digital memory: Phase change memory (PCM) is an emerging       technology expected to replace flash in solid-state memory for computers,       smart phones, etc., due to its higher performance and capacity to       extend battery life.
In 2008 Ilika began collaborating with NXP       Semiconductors [5.1, 5.3] to optimise new PCM materials through       its high throughput screening technology.
These are now being used by NXP       in embedded memory applications [5.6].
Biomaterials: Research into polymers, carried out by Bradley at       Southampton, with researchers at the Universities of Edinburgh and       Sheffield, produced biomedical applications.
This led to the founding of Altrika         Ltd in 2009 [5.7], a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ilika,       marketing cell-based skin regeneration therapies to treat burns and       hard-to-heal wounds.
In 2011, its Myskin&#174; and Cryoskin&#174;       products were being sold to seven NHS trusts, leading to accelerated       recovery, reduced scarring, reduced time in hospital and increased quality       of life for ~50 patients with particularly severe burns.
In December 2012,       Altrika was sold to Adiposet Ltd. [5.7], providing them with       quality systems and licenses-to-operate from the Human Tissue Authority       and Medicines and Health products Regulatory Agency, for expanding its       cell bio-processing and bio-banking projects.
This strategic decision       enabled Ilika to focus on its core cleantech programmes, now 90% of its       business.
Economic Impact: The direct economic impact on the UK economy is       through the formation of a PLC which now employs 35 staff (doubling since       2007), including 25 skilled scientists.
Its annual turnover has increased       from &#163;0.97m (2007) to &#163;2.01m (2012), growing ~25% pa since 2008.
Ilika,       listed in The Guardian Clean Tech 100, attracts inward investment into the       UK, with 83% of its revenue from international companies.
It was floated       on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange in 2010       [5.8] at a market capitalisation of &#163;18.7m and raised ~&#163;5.2m, with       a further &#163;5m in May 2012 [5.1, 5.3, 5.9].
Ilika received the New       Energy Awards University Spin-out of the Year in 2012 [5.10].
Its       business is supported by sales offices in Japan, USA and Germany.
Fostering the Impact: Essential to the realisation of the impact       was the involvement of the University of Southampton's Centre for       Enterprise &amp; Innovation (CEI), which assisted with the protection and       exploitation of the IP.
Company incubation was supported via       SETsquared (Southampton, Surrey, Bath, Bristol &amp; Exeter Universities).
Southampton Chemistry fostered Ilika's success by reducing Hayden's       workload to enable him to commit 50% of his time as CSO (2005-present).
According to Graeme Purdy (CEO, Ilika), "Brian's role is extremely         valuable to Ilika, both in a business development capacity and in         providing scientific and technical leadership and credibility with         customers" [5.4].
Ilika occupied research and office space       in Chemistry before relocating to the University of Southampton Science       Park in 2007.
Graeme adds, "Southampton Chemistry was critical in         nurturing Ilika's growth through structured access to space and a close         cooperation in the early days of the company".
Ilika continues to       hold a facilities agreement with the University, enabling them to access       specialist equipment on a commercial basis.
Strong collaborations between Southampton Chemistry and Ilika have also       continued through industrial CASE studentships, MChem placements, academic       consultancies and joint patents.
Southampton Chemistry also trained many       of the scientists employed by Ilika.
