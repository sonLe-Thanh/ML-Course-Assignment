     Fisher's research has contributed to the impact through comparative       analyses of the effects of regulations and the desirability of pursuing       statutory or self-regulation.
Corroborating sources are detailed in       Section 5 (S5.1-S5.23)     UK     Shaping Policy Recommendations            Finding 1 (F1) was submitted directly to the Committee on         Standards in Public Life by Fisher in his capacity as an advisor (S5.8,         S5.11).
This research persuaded the Committee that public opinion         should not be seen as an obstacle to recommending an extension of state         funding and, thereby, was of significance in shaping the Committee's         2011 report on party finance, most especially in its acceptance and         advancement of this conclusion (Ref1 &#8212; subsequently published in         2013).
The Committee notes that this `was a particularly difficult         recommendation to make but Professor Fisher's work provided hard         evidence to justify making the recommendation' (S5.18).
The         final report (S5.11) cited some 11 additional outputs by Fisher.
Fisher's position as advisor to the committee also allowed him to draw         on data and findings from ESRC and Electoral Commission funded studies         of constituency campaigning to inform discussions about the relative         impact of finance and voluntary work on constituency level campaigning (F5,         Ref5, S5.11, S5.17).
Finding 3 (F3) contributed to the dropping of `triggering' from         the Political Parties and Elections Bill following Fisher's appearance         at the Public Bill Committee (S5.3, S5.10).
Fisher's work         on electoral agents (S5.1) showed how there had been significant         confusion over the regulation of candidate expenses.
Given the high         proportion of voluntary agents and their relative inexperience, the         proposal risked imposing an unreasonable burden on party activists as         well as being almost impossible to regulate effectively (Ref5).
Fisher's research provided important information for the Electoral         Commission on the understanding of electoral procedures and the         perceived quality of information provided to candidates through ESRC and         Electoral Commission-funded studies of election agents in 2010 (S5.4).
An end of award rapporteur described this as `an excellent example of         cutting edge social science which speaks successfully to the policy         world as well as to the academy' (S5.19).
The Chief Executive         notes that this work informed the Commission's statutory work on the         2010 election and that Fisher's wider research was used to `help sense         check our policy assumptions, analysis and positions....In short,         Professor Fisher's research has played an important role in the         development of party and election finance policy' (F2-F5,         Ref1, Ref2, Ref3, Ref4, Ref5, S5.1,         S5.2, S5.4, S5.20).
Findings 3 and 4 (F3, F4) influenced the Public         Administration Select Committee's report on the regulation of lobbying         (for whom Fisher was the Special Advisor), both through work conducted         on behalf of the committee on the comparative regulation of lobbying,         but particularly through previous work on party finance regulation (Ref           3, Ref 4).
The parallels with political finance reform are         very apparent &#8212; both are areas of voluntary political activity with         discussions about lobbying reform mirroring those in party finance,         prior to the 2000 Act.
The committee reports that Fisher's research         informed their view on lobbying through the `clear evidence of the         perverse impacts that over-regulation could produce in a comparative         context' (S5.21).
Subsequently, Fisher contributed to practice         change by acting as a member of the Working Party to establish the UK         Public Affairs Council, set up following the report by the Select         Committee (2009) (S5.12).
Stimulating Debate, Improving Public Understanding and Challenging         Conventional Wisdom     Fisher's key findings (F1-F5) and wider research have       impacted on several stakeholders by stimulating debate, improving public       understanding and challenging conventional wisdom.
Fisher presented to senior management from the Electoral Commission on         the implications for the Commission of a change of government (2009),         based on the content and scenario planning methodology in Ref 6.
Fisher appeared before the Scottish Affairs Select Committee (S5.5)         to deliver evidence in respect of the campaign finance issues associated         with the referendum on separation for Scotland (2012).
This drew on both         Fisher's detailed understanding of the relevant legislation (Ref2,         Ref3, Ref4) and on the relative impact of election         spending and voluntary activity (Ref5).
Fisher appeared before the Speaker's Conference on Parliamentary         Representation (2009) (S5.9) to deliver evidence on the case for         using state funding of political parties to encourage representative         diversity (Ref2, Ref4)       Fisher appeared before the Political and Constitutional Reform Select         Committee to deliver evidence on regulation of lobbying (2012, S5.6)         drawing on Ref2, Ref3, Ref4, and the oversight         of the Parliamentary Constituencies and Voting System Bill (2010) (S5.7)       Fisher made two invited presentations in Parliament on party finance         based on his research findings in Ref3 and Ref4 and those         subsequently published in Ref2 &#8212; to the Associate Parliamentary         Group on Constitution, Parliament and Citizenship and to the Parliament         and Constitution Centre Seminar (2008).
During the review period, Fisher appeared on Sky News on         sixteen occasions, the BBC Westminster Hour eight times, BBC         television four times, ITV, Channel 4 and GMTV nine times, and various         BBC radio stations on seven occasions.
His cited remarks are regularly         syndicated via Reuters or Bloomberg.
Fisher's research has been used to improve understanding on party         finance in the legal profession.
He published detailed annotations of         the Political Parties and Elections Act 2009 drawing on Ref2, Ref3,         Ref4 in Current Law Statutes Annotated, used widely by         practicing lawyers (S5.16).
Training            Whilst retained as a policy advisor for the Electoral Commission,         Fisher delivered a training session for newly recruited staff on         political parties and campaigning.
Georgia, Poland and the Czech Republic:     Shaping Policy Recommendations            Fisher's research findings (F1-F5) (Ref1, Ref2,         Ref3, Ref4, Ref5) shaped policy recommendations         in the Council of Europe reviews of party finance in Poland and the         Czech Republic (Scientific Expert 2008-11).
The Council of Europe         confirms that that Fisher's analyses and contributions were `essential         for the preparation of the corresponding Evaluation Reports' which were         adopted in December 2008 (Poland S5.13) and April 2011 (Czech         Republic S5.14).
In the eight recommendations made in the Polish         report, the Council of Europe concluded in its compliance report that by         December 2010, six had been partly implemented in the framework of the         preparation of a new draft Electoral Code (S5.22).
Fisher's research findings (F1-F5) (Ref1, Ref2,         Ref3, Ref4, Ref5) shaped policy recommendations         in the Council of Europe review of party finance in Georgia, requested         by the Georgian Ministry of Justice.
Fisher reviewed existing regulation         and practice, met several times with key stakeholders, including the         Ministry of Justice, the advisor to the Prime Minister, the State Audit         Office, the political parties and civil society groups and made         recommendations for policy change (S5.15).
The Council of Europe         concluded that the report and discussions `raised the knowledge of         stakeholders of the possible drawbacks and benefits of certain         regulatory approaches, leading to better-informed draft amendments to         the existing legislation'.
It further commented that that `Professor         Fisher's recommendations were clearly informed by his academic research         and his ability to draw on and analyse experiences of other countries         contributed to the weight given to his report and the acceptance of his         recommendations' (S5.23).
