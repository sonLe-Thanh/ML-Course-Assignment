     Impacts on Ozone Depletion: Through emission controls of       certain halocarbons, the Montreal Protocol on `Substances that Deplete         the Ozone Layer' has been hugely successful in avoiding ozone       depletion and has thus protected the global population from increased UV       radiation and ozone-related climate change.
The Montreal Protocol is an       international agreement which was initially adopted in 1987, but is an       on-going process by which the Parties are informed of the latest science       through international WMO Assessments (hereafter referred to as       Assessments) provided by a Scientific Assessment Panel of experts every 4       years, and, based on these, the Parties have agreed Amendments to the       Protocol [7].
It is through inclusion of our results in this on-going       process of Assessments and Amendments that out research has had most       impact.
This impact of our research has occurred in two forms.
(i) Research in       the earlier part of the REF research-period has fed through the       Assessments into internationally agreed Amendments to the Protocol and       subsequent national policies, which have in turn led to observable       declines in emissions and atmospheric concentrations of ozone depleting       substances during the REF impact- period.
(ii) Our more recent research is       impacting policy through the latest 2010 Assessment.
Evidence (citations       and authorship) of our contribution to the Montreal Protocol process is       found in the Assessments [7, 8] and by the testimonial provided by the Co-Chair         of the Scientific Assessment Panel [9].
In addition to impacting policy on ozone depleting substances through the       established international process, we have also reported our research       results directly to the UK Government.
The Head of the Global         Atmosphere Division in the UK Department of the Environment has       provided a testimonial to confirm this [10].
Below are 2 examples where the impact of our research has been         observable in the environment during 2008-13:     Example 1a - Halons:       UEA research contributed to the science which led to strengthening of the       Montreal Protocol, resulting in an observable decline in bromine from       halons during 2008-13, as corroborated by the Co-Chair of the         Scientific Assessment Panel: "Despite halon emission controls in         developed countries, UEA research (Fraser et al, 1999) showed continuing         increase in global emissions of the most abundant halon and alerted         Parties to the growth in atmospheric concentrations of a previously         undetected halon (1202).
Consequently the Protocol resolved to identify         the sources of halon-1202 and introduced controls on the other halons         for developing countries.
The impact has been that global emissions of         all halons have fallen dramatically, with concentrations of all but one         halon declining during the 2008-13 period (Newland et al, 2013)."
[9].
Example 1b - Methyl Bromide:       UEA research contributed to the science which led to methyl bromide       becoming a controlled substance under the Montreal Protocol in 1997 and to       subsequent Amendments and hence to lower atmospheric concentrations in       2008-13 [7, 11, 12].
This is corroborated by the Head of the Global         Atmosphere Division in the UK Department of the Environment: "UEA         research during 1993-2003 helped to better constrain estimates of the         anthropogenic contribution to atmospheric methyl bromide, which enabled         the Parties to the Montreal Protocol to make informed decisions about         its control.
As a result of the controls introduced, atmospheric methyl         bromide concentrations have decreased substantially."
[10].
Below is an example where our research has informed policy-making         during 2008-13:     Example 2: 2010 Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion:       The UEA research on halocarbons continues to have an on-going impact on       international policy through the latest 2010 Assessment as corroborated by       the Co-Chair of the Scientific Assessment Panel:     "I presented the scientific findings of the 2010 Assessment at the 23rd         Meeting of Parties to the Montreal Protocol in 2011.
UEA research         contributed to these findings with the Assessment citing 11 papers where         UEA scientists were authors, including Fraser et al (1999), Oram et al         (1998) and Laube et al (2008).
Halocarbon concentration data from UEA         were also included in the Assessment."
[9].
Impacts on Global Warming: Most long-lived halocarbon gases       are also strong greenhouse gases, thus their control has also prevented a       large contribution to climate forcing, including during the 2008-13 period       [7].
The same UEA research that has underpinned the Montreal Protocol has       therefore contributed to the climate forcing benefits of the Protocol.
However, the gain from reductions in the emissions of the CFCs and halons       is threatened by the transition to other non-ozone-depleting halocarbons       as replacement compounds, many of which are strong greenhouse gases (e.g.
HFCs).
These replacement halocarbons are therefore included in the       WMO Ozone Assessments along with other fluorinated compounds that are       potent greenhouse gases (i.e.
PFCs) because of their climate       impact even though they are not ozone- depleting substances.
UEA papers on       HFC-23, HFC-227ea, CF4 and C2F6       have been cited in the 2010 Assessment that was reported to the 2011       Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol.
Furthermore, the HFCs and PFCs are included in the Kyoto       Protocol, which is an international agreement under the United Nations       Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which commits its Parties       by setting emission reduction targets.
The Parties make decisions based on       scientific information reported to them by the Intergovernmental Panel on       Climate Change (IPCC).
UEA research on the HFCs has been cited in several       IPCC reports, for example in 2007.
The Co-Chair of Working Group 1 of the 2007 IPCC who has       also been a regular member of the Scientific Assessment Panel for the         Montreal Protocol has provided a testimonial [13] to confirm our       contribution to the development of international policy on greenhouse       gases:     "Over the last 20 years, scientists at UEA have made many valuable         contributions to the understanding of the abundances of halocarbons in         the atmosphere.
Their research has been included in, and they have been         co-authors of, many of the scientific assessments for the Montreal         Protocol and the reports of the IPCC.
UEA has therefore contributed to         the success the Montreal Protocol has had in reducing greenhouse gas         emissions.
The UEA work on the trends in concentrations of the HCFCs       and HFCs was also included in the 2007 IPCC         report that better informed the UNFCCC of the climate-relevance of the         key halocarbons during 2008-13.
UEA has also identified and made first         measurements of certain important halocarbons.
These newly observed         gases have thereafter become part of the growing number of gases         reviewed in subsequent assessments of both the IPCC and the Montreal         Protocol.
E.g.
SF5CF3,         which has one of the highest radiative forcing efficiencies per molecule         of any gas in the atmosphere.
UEA has also made important contributions         to the understanding of changing levels of HFC-23, an exceptionally         strong greenhouse gas and a by-product of the manufacture of HCFC-22,         and HFC-227ea."
