     Contributions to policy debates     Oakes' Language, Citizenship and Identity [1] is widely       considered as an important reference point       for language-policy debates in Quebec.
A French translation was funded       jointly by the AHRC       (Research Dissemination Scheme, AH/F500165/1, &#163;10,318, 2007-8) and the       Secr&#233;tariat &#224; la       politique linguistique (CAD$2150; funding application made on Oakes'       behalf by the Quebec       Government Office in London).
It is promoted on the websites of both the       Conseil sup&#233;rieur de la       langue fran&#231;aise and the Secr&#233;tariat &#224; la politique linguistique, where it       is described as of interest       to `all those who are passionate about questions of language and identity'       (http://goo.gl/m7duxV).
Both versions of the book are held by the libraries of relevant Quebec       government ministries and       language-planning agencies.
To further inform macro-level language-policy       debates, copies were       sent to language-planning agencies elsewhere in Canada and France.
`Le       fran&#231;ais comme       " langue publique commune &#187;' [3] is cited in a 2008 report on       demolinguistic predictions for       Quebec commissioned by the Office qu&#233;b&#233;cois de la langue fran&#231;aise (see       section 5, [6]).
Pfalzgraf's work has informed debate within the German Parliament.
The       day before the       Bundestag's petition committee discussed a petition seeking to       define German as the national       language in the constitution, he was interviewed by Anatol Stefanowitsch,       the representative       opposing the petition.
The interview was published in the academic blog SprachLog         &#8212; Spektrum der         Wissenschaften SciLogs (5 November 2011), average 25,000 weekly hits       (http://goo.gl/Pq5crH).
The petition committee's discussion can be viewed at http://goo.gl/qhsZAY.
Pfalzgraf's research also led the GfdS (Gesellschaft f&#252;r deutsche         Sprache, Association for the       German Language), Germany's most important government-sponsored language       society, to invite       him to chair its UK branch.
The GfdS advises individuals, companies,       authorities and institutions on       contemporary German spelling, grammar and style.
Its editorial panel of       the parliament       (Redaktionsstab der Gesellschaft f&#252;r deutsche Sprache beim Deutschen         Bundestag) gives       linguistic advice to both the Federal Council (Bundesrat) and the       Federal parliament (Bundestag).
Its most important task is to revise the language of draft legislation,       by-laws and orders whose       legal terminology must be formulated clearly and concisely.
As chair,       Pfalzgraf promotes the       German language by organizing public events such as lectures.
Informing public attitudes to language     More generally, Pfalzgraf's findings have contributed to greater public       understanding of linguistic       change and its implications for cultural identity.
German media, and       sometimes also foreign media,       regularly report on German linguistic purism, in particular the       anti-anglicism movement on which       Pfalzgraf's research concentrates.
Various UK and German newspapers and       journals have       therefore contacted Pfalzgraf to provide expert views on the perceived       `decay of German'.
Publications are of different kinds, and cumulatively reach a wide       audience.
In some cases,       readers' responses to online versions of the articles indicate their       direct engagement with the       issues.

Oakes' "Le fran&#231;ais comme " langue publique commune &#187; au Qu&#233;bec" was       selected along with       three other articles from Globe: Revue internationale d'&#233;tudes         qu&#233;b&#233;coises to be translated to       make the language situation in Quebec better known to a lay       English-speaking audience in a book       series on Quebec Studies: French as the Common Language in Qu&#233;bec:         History, Debates and         Positions (New Perspectives in Qu&#233;bec Studies 2) (with Ian       Lockerbie, Ines Molinaro and Karim       Larose).
Montr&#233;al: &#201;ditions Nota bene, 2005.
Contributions to education     Oakes was awarded a grant (CAN$2500) by the Association internationale       des &#233;tudes       qu&#233;b&#233;coises enabling 50 copies of Language, Citizenship and Identity       to be bought and distributed       to Quebec and Canadian Studies centres worldwide; the books were purchased       in late 2007, and       distribution began in 2008.
Both the English and French versions are used       in university teaching in       various fields in Canada and beyond - e.g.
Sherbrooke and Laval       (Linguistics), Simon Fraser       University (French), Montreal and Ottawa (Politics, Anthropology,       Sociology), and Washington       (Slavic studies) - thereby helping to shape understanding of language and       identity in Canada       amongst teaching staff and students.
Pfalzgraf's publications are also used in undergraduate and postgraduate       teaching internationally,       shaping teachers' and students' understanding of linguistic purism (not       solely in Germany).
Neopurismus has been a core text for a Slavonic Studies course at       Greifswald       (http://goo.gl/wO2OV3), thereby       influencing the design and delivery of a syllabus.
His work also       appears on reading lists at the universities of Cambridge (German), Leeds       (German), Munich       (Linguistics), and Mashhad University, Iran (Linguistics).
