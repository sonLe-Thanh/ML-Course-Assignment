     There were three main levels of impact following on from the research.
These involved:     1) Production of guides: a) for multi-agency practitioners and       policy makers (Hicks and Stein, 2010); and b) for young people (NSPCC,       2010).
Both were developed collaboratively by researchers and participants       from the qualitative stages of the research, with practitioners and young       people assisting in the structure, form and content of the guides.
As is       usual with outputs from government funded research, both guides were peer       reviewed by academics, practitioners and civil servants in the DCSF       Project Advisory Group.
The guide for young people won the Plain English Campaign 2010 `Plain       English' annual award.
The research findings and guides have been       disseminated widely, with presentations by Stein (http://php.york.ac.uk/inst/spru/profiles/msC.php)       and by Hicks, to policy, practice and academic audiences.
Recent examples include the invited keynote presentations and two       workshops given by Hicks, commissioned by East Dunbarton Child Protection       Committee, at the `GETTING IT RIGHT for Children and Young People [GIRFEC]       in East Dunbartonshire' multi-agency training event held for practitioners       in Glasgow, November 2012.
GIRFEC is a new national initiative that       promotes multi-agency working and accountability, and underpins all       Scottish Government policies for children and young people.
2) National policy influence: the multi-agency guide, Neglect         Matters, was published by DCSF (4,000 copies) and distributed to all       local authorities, with downloadable links provided on the Every Child         Matters website.
The publication was launched at a Centre for       Excellence and Outcomes in Children and Young People's Services (C4EO)       event, alongside the launch of the 2010 edition of the extensive       government guidance, Working Together to Safeguard Children: a guide         to inter-agency working to safeguard and promote the welfare of children,       in which the adolescent neglect project was cited.
In June 2010, the Secretary of State for Education commissioned a review       of child protection, which heralds a radical shift from previous reforms (The         Munro Review of Child Protection: Final Report &#8212; A child-centred system,       Department for Education (2011)).
Proposals enable professionals to make       the best judgements about the help to give children, young people and       families.
Neglect Matters: A multi-agency guide for professionals         working together on behalf of teenagers is referenced in the Munro       review as evidence to support the importance of young people's       participation and inclusion in child protection work.
3) Local practice and policy influence: building on this research,       funding from the University of Lincoln, Faculty of Social Science Research       Fund, supported Hicks and her (then) colleague, Flynn, in utilisation work       with a whole tier of Children's Service managers in one LA from December       2010 to July 2012.
Hicks and Flynn worked in partnership with eight       multi-agency senior managers to consider the relevance of the research       findings to their own settings, with the action research goal of       implementing changes in local awareness, practice and policy.
The LA       District Management Team were keen to work with our innovative approach to       service development, and agreed to the release of staff time with a view       to establishing potential for change in participants' own practice and in       local policy.
Initially, five workshops were held with eight senior       managers from the range of children's services.
The sessions were based on       a utilisation model developed by a regional hub of the national research       dissemination/utilisation federation, Making Research Count,       involving:            fitting the research findings to participants' own areas of practice         and policy, establishing the implications for individual agencies and         for the LA in making changes to practice;       identifying the potential for the development of practice and policy         within participants' own jurisdiction, establishing goals for change;       devising plans to enable change, implementing, monitoring and         reviewing progress.
To create changes in practice and policy managers were enabled to       develop short guides to adolescent neglect for staff working in different       agencies, e.g.
substance abuse and counselling.
Safeguarding Screening       Tools approved by the LSCB were revised to include adolescent neglect and       are currently in use throughout the LA.
Follow-up interviews with       individual managers established the nature of changes in practice and       policies, examples of which include: cultural shifts ensuing from the       recognition of `adolescent neglect' as a term for use; the inclusion of       neglect in assessments of older children and their families; and       monitoring data on adolescent neglect being collected by the LA       performance team.
