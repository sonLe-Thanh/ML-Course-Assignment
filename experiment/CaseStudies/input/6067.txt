     Atkinson's research outputs have informed her own professional practice       in her university teaching and research roles, and impact on practice in       D&amp;T education in secondary schools and initial teacher training       courses nationally (Source 2; 4; 7) and internationally (Source 1; 3; 7;       9).
The beneficiaries include trainee teachers at Sunderland and in other       universities, schoolteachers, fellow ITT tutors, members of DATA (Source       6), the Design Technology Examination team at the International       Baccalaureate Organisation (Source 5), and the wider international D&amp;T       community (Source 1; 3).
Her major contribution and impact on D&amp;T education has been       recognised nationally and internationally;            She was awarded an MBE in 2011 for Services to Higher Education,       The Design and Technology Association awarded her for Outstanding         Contribution to Design and Technology Education in 2010       Epsilon Pi Tau, the International Honour Society for Professions in         Technology, based in America, awarded her a Certificate for         Distinguished Services on the Board of Editors of the Journal of         Technology Studies 2002-2011       She is frequently invited to be the keynote speaker at national and         international conferences.
Specifically, the impact of her work can be seen in:     Changed practice for specific groups.
Atkinson's research on the factors influencing designing style and       effective practice in teaching design have influenced her teaching on ITT       and other HE programmes, and have thus had an impact on her students'       design practice.
Many of these subsequently entered the teaching       profession, where their approach to teaching D&amp;T has been influenced       by their ITT experiences, with consequent impact on pupils (Source 6).
Influence on professional standards, guidelines or training.
Atkinson's research on the factors influencing designing style and       effective practice in teaching design has been influential in the training       of D&amp;T teachers nationally and internationally.
Atkinson (2000) was reprinted in a standard textbook for ITT D&amp;T         students (2002 `Creativity versus the need for high levels of         performance' in: G. A. Owen-Jackson, (Ed.)
Teaching Design and           Technology in Secondary Schools, London: Routledge Taylor Francis.
161-176), used extensively on PGCE programmes (Source 2; 7), and for         research assignments at Masters Level (Source 7).
Atkinson's work was extensively cited in an influential literature         review on the impact of D&amp;T in schools commissioned by the         Department of Education and Skills (Harris and Wilson, 2003) and in What           is wrong with D&amp;T?
(Miller, 2012) (Source 6).
DATA reports that Atkinson's research has made a considerable         contribution to developments in pedagogical and assessment practice in         secondary D&amp;T (Source 6).
DATA also report that her work on the training and continuing         professional development of D&amp;T teachers (Atkinson 2006, 2008, 2009,         2011, 2012, 2013) has been influential in the D&amp;T community.
The         issues she raised have been subsequently addressed in OFSTED         publications (OFSTED 2008, 2011) (Source 6).
Her research has had an impact at an international level in several         countries including Israel (Source 3) Botswana, Cyprus (Source 7)         Brunei, Australia (Source 1), New Zealand and Slovakia (Source 9).
Development of resources to enhance professional practice     In addition to Owen-Jackson (2002), cited above, Atkinson       was invited to write a chapter on Encouraging Imagination in Design         Education: A vision for the future (Source 8) and has co-authored,       with Professor Paul Black, a chapter on assessment in D&amp;T in Design         and Technology: for the next Generation, edited by David Barlex       (2007) which has impacted upon D&amp;T ITT students across the UK.
Use of research findings in the conduct of professional work or         practice     Atkinson's work has impact across the full breadth of the D&amp;T       community (UK, Germany, Holland, Botswana, Israel, Sweden, Australia, New       Zealand) through the presentation of her research findings at national and       international conferences, including WOCATE (World Council of Associations       of Technology Education) Conference (2000); the International Pupils'       Attitudes to Technology Conferences (2001; 2003; 2007; 2008; 2011; 2012;       2013), European Learning Styles Information Network Conferences (2003;       2004; 2005); DATA International Research Conferences (2004; 2005; 2009),       and conferences in Botswana (2000) Slovakia (2002; 2009), Cyprus (2009)       Australia (2012) and New Zealand (2013).
Atkinson is an external advisor       for International Baccalaureate D&amp;T examinations and a member of their       curriculum review team specifically because of her research into best       practice in D&amp;T (Source 5).
She also has impact internationally as an       external advisor and resource contact for PhD students researching design       activity at Old Dominion University Norfolk Virginia USA, and as an       External Evaluator for The Hong Kong Institute of Education of Research       Grant applications.
Influence on planning or management of services     Atkinson has presented papers to management teams and other ITT providers       on the planning, subject content and implementation of ITT D&amp;T       programmes with particular reference to design activity based upon her       research findings in the UK to HMI (Source 6), and internationally in       Botswana, Slovakia (Source 9), Cyprus (Source 7) and Australia (Source 1).
Use of research findings by professional bodies to define best         practice, formulate policy, or to lobby government or other stakeholders     Atkinson's work has been used by DATA officials in lobbying the TDA about       the training of D&amp;T teachers, in discussion with HMI concerning length       of study time to gain subject knowledge in D&amp;T, and in shaping DATA       policies and resources.
It has recently included her work in a review of       the latest research in D&amp;T, and in its response to the National       Curriculum Review Consultation (Source 6).
The significant impact on       public policy and in changing the government's National Curriculum       proposals for D&amp;T is also corroborated by Baynes (Source 8).
Practitioner debate has been informed or stimulated by research         findings     As described above, Atkinson's work has stimulated debate in many       countries amongst student teachers, practicing teachers, teacher       educators, and DATA officers through workshops and conference       presentations and through its inclusion in widely used publications.
Research has challenged conventional wisdom, stimulating debate among         stakeholders     Atkinson gave the Keynote John Eggleston Memorial Lecture at DATA Annual       Conference 2009, in which she challenged some aspects of the training of       D&amp;T teachers, based upon her research into design activity.
This was       subsequently published (Atkinson 2009), and was used in discussions       between DATA and HMI regarding the future training of D&amp;T teachers       (Source 6).
She also conveyed her provocative message to an international       audience in Australia as the keynote presenter at the 7th biennial       ITCE (2012) (Source 1)
