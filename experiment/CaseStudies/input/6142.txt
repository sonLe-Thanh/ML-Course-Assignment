     Teaching and learning of computer architecture has been enhanced using       highly interactive simulations with carefully constructed visualisations       and animations.
The teaching and learning of computer organisation and architecture is an       essential part of the education of computer engineers and computer       scientists.
Most degree level courses in these areas offer modules in       computer architecture and operating systems as identified and recommended       in a joint report on Computer Science Curricula (Other Source 1) by ACM       and the IEEE Computer Society.
However, these areas have traditionally       been relatively difficult to teach and complex to grasp by the students       through passive teaching methods, experimenting using commercial products       and developing software requiring moderate to high programming expertise.
As a result tutors turned to using simulation and visualisation methods of       demonstrating the architectural mechanisms and algorithms to their       students.
Much algorithm simulation software has been developed over the past few       decades and these have achieved some success in demonstrating the inner       workings of isolated computational algorithms.
Nevertheless there has not       been a consistent method of assessing the requirements for simulating and       visualising complex systems that can both engage and provide deep learning       experiences for the students of computer architecture.
It is precisely       this aspect that this research addresses: methods of simulating, with the       help of appropriate visualisations and animations, the workings of a       modern computer system and demonstrating the interplay between its       different components in ways that provide a rich, consistent and engaging       learning environment from basic to more advanced levels.
The research work has resulted in a unique set of tightly integrated       simulations in a single software package with related teaching materials       and eight conference publications mainly reporting on the work done to       improve and evaluate the pedagogical value of the simulations with funding       support from the Higher Education Academy.
A dedicated website (Other       Source 2) was established in 2009 in order to help widely disseminate this       work and make the software freely available.
Additionally, a reference to       this site was deposited (2011) in the learning materials repository Jorum       (Other Source 3) which is a JISC-funded collaborative venture to collect       and share learning and teaching materials and is based at the University       of Manchester.
This helps to direct users to the project website, as do       the deposits in the following repositories:            WWW Computer Architecture Page (Other Source 4), maintained by a         group from Computer Sciences Department at University of         Wisconsin-Madison (USA) &#8212; deposited in 2010.

It is clear that this publicly and freely accessible presence on the       Internet afforded maximum reach to educational institutions, mainly       universities and colleges of higher education, and individuals worldwide.
There is clear evidence that the simulation software has been and       continues to be in use by tutors in several higher education institutions       in various parts of the world.
In a recent survey conducted by Mustafa       on the reach and impact of the simulation software on their teaching and       their students, tutors from five universities clearly identified the       impact on their students between 2011 and 2013.
The table below is a       summary of the results of this survey demonstrating the estimated annual       reach of the impact in these five universities (total annual number of       students 775):                                Country           Institution           Course(s)           Academic Level(s)            No of Students (Annual cohorts,             est.)

Please see Section 5 for details of corroborators.
There       is also clear evidence that these impacts are on-going as the same tutors       stated that they intended to continue using the software in their teaching       and requested additional support.
Additionally, there is strong indication (via correspondences and       references to the software's web site from external VLEs) that other       educators in a growing number of countries such as Chile, USA, Brazil,       Canada, UK, Serbia, Australia and Sri Lanka have also been using the       software in their teaching.
Furthermore, according to the software's web       site statistics there has been an average of 1200 hits per month from over       100 different countries and an average of 50 downloads per month over the       past 12 months, rising sharply to 350 in the months leading to August       2013.
According to published site statistics on the Jorum Site (Other       Source 6) the software has been viewed an average of 20 times per month       over the past 6 months since the start of collection of their new       statistics (March 2013).
