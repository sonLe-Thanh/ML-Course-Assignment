     The main pathway to impact of the research was the commissioning (by the       Parliamentary       Ombudsman and Local Government Ombudsman in the UK, and by the Gibraltar       Ombudsman) of       Kirkham to undertake three separate evaluations of Ombudsman schemes,       resulting in three       reports:     (1) The Parliamentary Ombudsman: Withstanding the Test of Time,       HC 421 (2006-07).
Published       as a Parliamentary Paper, this report identified the Parliamentary       Ombudsman's flexible legislative       scheme as key to the office's success, but outlined a series of key       aspects of its work as in need of       reform.
(2) External Evaluation of the Local Government Ombudsman (2013)       (with Richard Thomas, Chair       of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council (AJTC) and Jim Martin       (Scottish Public       Services Ombudsman).
The report was produced in response to a       recommendation of the       Parliamentary Select Committee on Communities and Local Government (CLG),       following user       dissatisfaction with the organisation, The Work of the Local         Government Ombudsman (2012-13)       HC 431, (para 69).
Kirkham was the lead researcher and author on the       evaluation team (with       Richard Thomas (Chair)).
(3) The Gibraltar Public Services Ombudsman: A Model for the Future       (2013).
The report explored       the current jurisdiction of the Gibraltar Ombudsman and the limitations on       its capacity to operate to       its full potential.
It made a number of recommendations, focusing in       particular on corporate       governance and on the need to enhance the interconnection between this       office and Parliament.
The combined impact of Kirkham's research includes:     (i) Changing approaches within Ombudsman schemes and informing best         practice             Ombudsman schemes have changed their strategy and policies as a         result of Kirkham's         work.
The UK Parliamentary Ombudsman has followed Kirkham's lead in         seeking         enhanced engagement with Parliament, a point accepted by the         Parliamentary Public         Administration Select Committee (PASC) when it examined Kirkham's report         [S1] (Q.39-         41).
The Gibraltar Ombudsman's stated intention is to use Kirkham's         evaluation as the         basis for reform of the office, concluding that "without doubt, this         report will mark a `before         and after' for the Ombudsman in Gibraltar" [S2].
The Local Government         Ombudsman         (LGO) has accepted almost all the recommendations of Kirkham et al's         evaluation as         confirmed in the minutes of its governing body, LGO Commission [S3],         including proposals         on independence and the restructuring of its corporate governance and         quality control         regime.
The Parliamentary Ombudsman has placed Kirkham's consultation         response at the heart of         her efforts to obtain a legislative amendment to remove the MP filter         (which denies citizens         the right to bring a complaint directly to her) from the current scheme         [S4] (p 23).
Practitioner debate on best practice within the Ombudsman community         has been regularly         informed by Kirkham's research, with his work often directly cited by         Ombudsmen [S5].
A         direct contribution to debate has been achieved through regular         invitations to speak at the         leading forums for senior practitioners, including the British and Irish         Ombudsman         Association (renamed the Ombudsman Association) in 2009, the Caribbean         Ombudsman         Association in 2008, and the International Ombudsman Institute (IOI) in         2012.
The Chair of         the IOI recently described Kirkham's presentation to its global         quadrennial gathering as a         `stimulating opening to the Conference' [S6].
Kirkham's argument that the Ombudsman should be considered as part of         the integrity         branch of the constitution [R2] [R3] has been taken up by several         Ombudsmen in their         writing, speeches and Parliamentary submissions [S5].
Kirkham's recent         promotion of an         own-initiative power of investigation for the Ombudsman has also been         largely accepted by         the British Ombudsman community [S5].
(ii) Influencing Governments' decision-making             Kirkham's Gibraltar evaluation has been presented to the Gibraltar         Chief Minister and         separately to senior figures in the Gibraltar Government, with a view to         introducing         legislative reform [S2].
Kirkham's proposals are to: (1) amend the         Ombudsman statute; (2)         expand the office's jurisdiction; (3) reform the Ombudsman's legal         powers; and (4) clarify         key details of the relationship between the Ombudsman and the Government         in Gibraltar.
Kirkham's LGO evaluation was submitted to both the Department for         Communities and         Local Government (DCLG) and the CLG Parliamentary Select Committee for         their         consideration and response [S3].
Following the evaluation, the DCLG is         conducting its own         internal review, and the CLG is undertaking a Parliamentary inquiry in         Autumn 2013.
The         evaluation includes the recommendation that the Government should grant         greater         autonomy to the LGO, and introduce amendments to legislation to         facilitate enhanced         independence and accountability.
(iii) Forming opinions within Parliament             Kirkham's work with Buck and Thompson specifically recommended merger         and reform of         Ombudsman schemes in Northern Ireland [R2].
The need for legislative         reform of the         Northern Ireland Ombudsman has been accepted by the Committee of the         Northern Ireland         Assembly, citing their work [S7], with the Assembly taking the decision         to introduce         legislation.
Kirkham was a member of a team of academics who submitted evidence to         the         Parliamentary Justice Committee arguing that the Administrative Justice         and Tribunals         Council (AJTC) should not be abolished, as per Government proposals.
This work repeated         the claims in favour of the AJTC made elsewhere in Kirkham's research         [R2] [R6].
Citing         the team's submission regularly, the Justice Committee produced a report         (2012-13 (HC         965)) in favour of preservation of the AJTC, which led the Chair of the         AJTC to thank         personally members of the academic team.
"Your combined submission was         one of the         most powerful the Committee received and clearly made an impact upon         them" [S8].
(iv) Shaping the debate at the policy-making level             Kirkham's research has shaped the policy and recommendations of the         Law Commission in         its review of remedies in Public Law, as published in a series of Law         Commission reports         [S9].
Influenced by Kirkham's work and his responses to its consultation         process, the Law         Commission was persuaded to include Ombudsman reform at the heart of its         study of         administrative law remedies.
With the bulk of the Law Commission's work         on remedies         failing to attract support, later reports of the Law Commission were         redirected specifically         on the Ombudsman, again partially in response to the arguments made in         Kirkham's         research and thereafter submitted to the Commission.
Many of Kirkham's recommendations were adopted by the Commission.
Specifically these         include (1) the removal of the statutory bar which prevents the         Ombudsman accepting         complaints that could otherwise go to court, and (2) the transfer of         complaints from the         Ombudsman to the courts and vice versa.
The influence of the research on         the Law         Commission's thinking on Ombudsman reform is evidenced by citations in         their papers         between 2008 and 2011 [S9].
In its final report, the Law Commission accepted the conclusions of         Kirkham's research with         Buck and Thompson [R2] [R6] in recommending that a wholesale review of         the overall AJ         system, and in particular of the public service Ombudsmen network, was         necessary in         order to address the ad hoc nature of its evolution and current         incoherence [S9].
Kirkham         was invited in June 2012 to lecture at a special conference of the AJTC         on this issue [S10].
The conference was attended by over 50 people from public sector         organisations,         government, lawyers and voluntary associations affected by         administrative justice.
The idea         of a review of the public service Ombudsmen network is currently being         pursued by the         Parliamentary Ombudsman [S5].
