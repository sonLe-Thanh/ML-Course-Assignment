     Romeo &amp; Juliet in Performance.
Drawing on Cordner's       research into on the creative challenges, demands and opportunities the       early repertoire offers modern actors, this collaboration with Film       Education on an interactive DVD resource for GCSE English seeks to       actively engage students with Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet by       providing examples of how scenes from the play can be interpreted, staged       and performed.
Ensuring that the play remains fresh and relevant to new       generations, the learning aims also include how to examine texts as a       blueprint for performance, and how multiple interpretations of       characterisation, voice and relationships can be developed.
Cordner staged       and directed colleague Tom Cantrell in scenes of the play, which were       filmed by other departmental colleagues, with additional commentary and       insight was provided via an interview with Cantrell.
The project has       facilitated both a new engagement with Shakespeare and the potential to       explore the relationship between Theatre and Film in a teaching resource       produced for secondary schools.
Romeo &amp; Juliet in Performance       was piloted by Film Education at their annual teaching conference in 2012       and since then 4400 DVDs have been distributed to schools via direct mail       or through the National Association of English Teachers.
The DVDs are       supplied with a mechanism allowing Film Education to track when a school       first registers the DVD online.
As research suggests that only a third of       teachers use the DVD on a web-connected PC, the 571 users registered by 31st       May 2013 may actually reflect a total of over 1700 users, a figure that       may be increased further if we account for schools registering a single       disc for use by multiple teachers.
On average each registered user used       the disc for three one hour lessons.
The resource was nominated for a       BAFTA in the `Children's, Learning &#8212; Secondary', category.
Jacobean City Comedy.
This project has led to the editing,       adaptation, staging and production by Cordner of two Jacobean       masterpieces, A Mad World My Masters in June 2011 and The         Dutch Courtesan in June 2013.
These productions have been supported       by major funding from the Shepherd Trust.
The cast and crew of both, as       well as the website team for the second, were drawn from the staff and       students of the Department of Theatre, Film and Television.
The live       performances have a significant local as well as a national reach.
Approximately 500 tickets were sold for A Mad World and 340 for The         Dutch Courtesan.
There is an additional educational engagement and       outreach dimension for the latter production &#8212; a public pre-show talk with       Guardian theatre critic Michael Billington demonstrated the play's place       in modern theatre practices and discussed the place of the Jacobean       repertory on the modern stage, while freelance director and TFTV comedy       outreach officer Tom Wright conducted three practical workshops on       Jacobean trickster comedy for schools and the general public.
The production is accompanied by a specially designed website,       www.dutchcourtesan.co.uk, which will benefit both school and university       students as well as a wider, non-university public (including theatre       practitioners and companies interested in translating plays from this       repertoire into performance).The website:            tracks the production stage-by-stage from early research to the         performances, offering insight into the rehearsal and research         processes, and demonstrating ways in which students can unlock the         performance potential of demanding, early modern scripts.
hosts and promotes new debate between an international team of         scholars about the play and the worlds out of which it was generated.
tracks past explorations of the early modern repertory at York.
It         makes available further materials about the Mad World         production, including the film made of it.
engages with theatre professionals, including discussion of the         challenges of performance with Olivier award-winning actor Oliver Ford         Davies.
engages with schools and teachers, and will host a filmed workshop         with Perry Mills, deputy head at King Edwards School,         Stratford-upon-Avon, and director of an internationally-acclaimed         company of boys from the school working on this repertory.
The website went live on 15/03/13 and by 22/08/13 had received 1867       unique visitors and over 15,000 page views.
The film of A Mad World       alone has attracted 100 views.
Visits from the UK account for 83% of       traffic, while around 10% is derived from Canada and the US.
Significant       traffic has also been seen from Germany, Australia, the Netherlands,       France, South Korea, Spain, India and Austria.
The site has already been       used as a teaching resource by lecturers at the University of Kent and       Stanford University and provides a model of early modern theatre research       and web-based publishing for the newly-commissioned Global Shakespeare       series for Blackwell.
Cordner conducted workshops with the cast of the       Royal Shakespeare Company's production of A Mad World My Masters,       and wrote an article for the programme.
