     In sum, this research [a] quantified the benefit of cervical screening at       different ages; [b] quantified the benefit of screening at different       intervals; [c] quantified the harms of screening at different ages.
The       impacts listed below have been divided into impact on policy and guidance;       impact on practice; reduction in harms; economic impacts; and impact on       research internationally.
4a: Change in policy/guidance     UK: The cervical screening programme in England changed in 2003 to       adopt the ages and intervals recommended by Sasieni's team.
Policy was       reviewed in 2009 and remained the same.
In 2012, the National Screening       Committee (representing all four nations of the UK) recommended that       cervical screening should start at age 25 [11].
This was as a direct       result of Sasieni's research.
Reference [1] was published in July 2003.
It       was discussed by the Advisory Committee on Cervical Screening and, in       October 2003, the Minister for Public Health announced changes to the       cervical screening programme in England, including the changes to the       age-range and screening intervals that the Queen Mary researchers       recommended [12].
Sasieni spoke at the Minister's press conference to       explain the research.
Sasieni and Cuzick presented their epidemiological       findings (references 1,2,5,6) and modelling of impact of HPV vaccination       on cervical screening and cervical cancer in young women (reference 9) to       an extraordinary meeting of the Advisory Committee on Cervical Screening       in 2009.
In line with their research, the Committee unanimously       recommended against a proposal to change the age at first screen from 25       back to 20 [13].
USA: In 2012, a national guideline produced jointly by the       American Cancer Society, American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical       Pathology, and American Society for Clinical Pathology recommended       changing the screening interval from yearly to 3-yearly in women aged       21-29 and not screening women under 21 regardless of age of onset of       sexual activity [14, 15].
The USSPTF made similar recommendations [16].
This represents a marked change in policy as a result of Sasieni et al's       research.
In 2002, the recommendation in USA was that cervical screening       should occur from age 18 or soon after the onset of sexual activity.
Adoption of the recommendations in the USA has taken longer, perhaps       because of a long tradition of annual screening.
Whilst US guidance is       still not exactly in line with the research evidence, it was influenced by       the findings of Sasieni's team and represented a shift in a more       evidence-based direction.
4b: Change in public health practice     The percentage of women screened in different age groups in 2002-03 in       England was 22.4% at age 20-24, 25.6% at age 25-29, and 18.8% at age       55-59, representing a mix of three- and five-yearly screening from age       20-64 [17].
In 2010-11 (and 2011-12) those percentages were 2.1% (1.7%)       (age 20-24), 27.8% (28.3%) (age 25-29), and 15.3% (15.1%) (age 55-59) [18,       19].
Thus this research has not only resulted in a new policy but that       policy has been implemented and has had a clear impact on cervical       screening in England.
4c: Reduction in harms     There were some 53,000 abnormal (ie borderline changes or worse)       screening tests in women aged 20-24 in England in 2002-03 [17].
It is       reasonable to infer that most of these women would have been anxious.
In       2010-11 there were fewer than 8,000 such tests [18], a reduction of around       45,000.
All women with moderate dyskaryosis or worse (N=9702 aged 20-24 in       2002-03) were referred to colposcopy and approximately 22% of women with       borderline changes (N=23,020) and 43% of those with mild dyskaryoisis       (N=20,950) were referred (after a repeat abnormal test) [17].
Thus it is       estimated that some 20,000 fewer women aged 20-24 will have been referred       to colposcopy in 2010-11 compared to 2002-03.
At all ages in 2002-03,       16.8% of women referred with persistent low-grade cytology and 73.4% of       women referred with moderate dyskaryosis or worse had high-grade disease       on histology (CIN2 or worse) [17].
Certainly all these women would have       been offered treatment.
Consequently, as a result of this research an       estimated 8,500 women aged 20-24 will have avoided having unnecessary       treatment each year.
The team has quantified the harms and benefits of       starting screening at 20 rather than at age 25 and a table laying out the       numbers affected; this is available on the National Screening Committee       website [20].
A recent US editorial `Primum non nocere' acknowledged the       potential harms of cervical screening in inappropriate groups and/or at       over-frequent intervals [21].
4d: Cost savings to the NHS     The cost saving from not screening some 350,000 women each year is       approximately &#163;17.5 million [22].
The impact in the USA has been less       dramatic, but because the population is larger and was previously       encouraged to have annual screening from age 18, the economic impact has       been even greater.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention [23]       reports that an additional 23-24% of 18 and 19 year old women (i.e.
some 1       million women) have never had a Pap smear and an additional 16% of 20-24       year old women (about 1.75 million women) have not had a smear in the last       year.
Thus the change in policy had resulted in about 2.75 million fewer       Pap smears in women aged 18-24 in the year 2010.
It is difficult to       estimate the cost of cervical screening in the USA, but it is likely that       the annual saving is over $200 million.
4e: Informing further research internationally     Soon after the 2003 publication [1], Sasieni was contacted by colleagues       in Italy and invited to work with them; the following year a paper was       published broadly confirming the UK finding on Italian data [24].
A       routine audit of cervical screening has been set up in Sweden [25].
The       Wolfson team is coordinating an international collaborative audit of       cervical screening programmes and analysis of routine screening data.
The       design of the cervical screening audit is now being adapted and employed       to evaluate routine breast colorectal screening [26].
