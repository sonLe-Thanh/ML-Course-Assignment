     Communication and visualisation of risk: Professor       Spiegelhalter has worked with numerous       collaborators in establishing good practice in risk communication, in       particular the promotion of       visualisations such as icon arrays.
These include:     Spiegelhalter and Pearson's animation research [1] was used to help Breakthrough         Breast Cancer,       the largest UK breast cancer charity, Senior Information Officer [6], said       "Thank you so much for         the advice of yourself and Mike Pearson for the development of         Breakthrough Breast Cancer's         online guide to breast screening.
The icon array animations were a new         venture for us and your         advice and guidance was extremely helpful and has improved the end         product.
They are a pivotal         part of the tool and feedback so far from laypersons and colleagues         indicates that the animations         help people to understand the complex issue of the risk of over         diagnosis with breast screening         very well".
In 2012 Professor Spiegelhalter was asked to lead the statistical       analysis for the Expert Advisory       Group on Breast Implants that was charged with setting government policy       following the Poly       Implant Prothese (PIP) breast implants scandal [7].
This complex analysis       required careful       communication of the deeper uncertainties due to limited evidence, and led       to the government       decision not to undertake removal of the implants unless clinically       justified.
The elicitation exercise on the effect of plain packaging of cigarettes       is a `highly accessed' paper       on Biomed Central (over 3000 in the first 3 months) [8].
The Department of       Health is using this       study [9] as a major part of the impact assessment for deciding a policy       on plain packaging.
The       importance of this research is reflected in the tobacco industry       sponsoring full-page advertisements       in national newspapers criticising the study.
Professor Spiegelhalter has explained the techniques for communication       and visualization set out       in his research in numerous schools and public talks to around 40,000       people since 2008 including       around 16,000 school students.
A teacher in a comprehensive school       [10]reported "As a result of         David Spiegelhalter's visit, several of my year 13 students have openly         said they are very much         more interested in pursuing a career in Statistics as they could see how         useful and interesting it         could be."
Media presentation of risk and statistics: Based on       his research on the presentation of risk       stories in the news, good practice in media reporting has been promoted by       Professor       Spiegelhalter through, for example,     Working closely with the Science Media Centre from 2008, resulting in       numerous quotes provided       in leading news outlets concerning risk stories.
This led to Professor       Spiegelhalter being awarded       the 2011 Science Communication Award for Established Researchers from the       Society of Biology.
In addition, he was a member of the group that produced guidance for       science reporting that had       been requested by the Leveson Inquiry [11].
The Chief Executive of the       Science Media Centre       [14], said: "From mobile phones and cancer to vaccination and heart         disease, he has answered         countless calls from journalists to help them understand complex pieces         of scientific research.
Without his involvement, these public health stories would be prone to         inaccuracy.
David's         patience and willingness to engage, as well as a flair for pithy         soundbites and clever analogies,         means the public are well informed about health and science through the         popular media."
Engagement with newspapers leading to the adoption of improved practices,       for example meetings       with sub-editors at The Times and groups of reporters from the Guardian,       Daily Mail, Daily       Telegraph and ITN, and lecturing to trainee journalists and press       officers.
The Chief Science       Reporter, The Times [14], said: "David makes the subjects of risk and         statistics not only easy to         understand, but also entertaining and intriguing.
He's helped us at The         Times on all kinds of         stories.
He's also come in to give our sub-editors a talk on the         importance of being rigorous in         reporting statistics, which certainly had an impact on the way they went         about their jobs.".
Numerous public talks on media portrayal of statistics: including to over       500 at the Cambridge       Science Festival "100% of people who filled in an evaluation card said         `How to spot a shabby         statistic' was good or very good (85% very good!)"[13].
Professor Spiegelhalter comments on risk and statistics in the media on       Twitter as @undunc       (&gt;6000 followers, top 0.01% of Twitter users) and in 2012 was among       `top 6 scientists on Twitter'       in Observer magazine.
Professor Spiegelhalter's YouTube video on risk communication has had       over 85,000 views.
In 2012 Professor Spiegelhalter fronted a one-hour BBC4 documentary       `Tails You Win, the       Science of Chance' that featured visualisations based on the research of       Spiegelhalter and Mike       Pearson into icon arrays for `possible futures', and included       contributions from the Bank of England       on handling deeper uncertainties.
The YouTube clip has received over       17,000 [15] views.
Viewing       figures for the first showing were around 750,000 [12], extremely high for       a BBC4 science       programme.
"Understandably, much of human endeavour has amounted to an         effort to quantify,         regulate and eventually overcome chance.
Spiegelhalter is an immensely         engaging guide to this         struggle, meeting seismologists, gamblers, statisticians and others who         study the throw of the dice,         metaphorical or literal" [16]     Professor Spiegelhalter was the subject of an episode in the Radio 4       series `A Life Scientific' in       June 2013, discussing his work on Microlives and reaching an audience of       over 2 million.
