     HPP's impact strategy incorporates academics, organizations and       professionals, and Anonymous Fellowships themselves.
These form networks       of stake-holders who facilitate core research and data-gathering, and       build training and knowledge transfer projects.
These in turn are having       tangible impact in the form of evidence-based policy initiatives and       further collaborative action- research.

Dissemination     HPP Conferences at Chester have been a primary forum for raising       the profile of HPP findings and establishing a broad-based network of       stake-holders.
The first event, "A spiritual illness with a spiritual solution"         (March 2012) was attended by 70 delegates from clinical, academic and         service-user backgrounds.
A two-day event in February 2013 comprised three sessions, reflecting         the diverse and transnational nature of agencies involved:       "Faith-based solutions to addiction" (colloquium);       "Recovery from Addiction: Transatlantic inter-perspectives"         (public lecture);       "Practitioners' Seminar".
Papers at Academic Conferences provide opportunities to       communicate and test out HPP's core research and its potential impact on       support for addiction and recovery.

Public Engagement, Training and Continuing Professional           Development (October 2012-July 2013)     Presentations and workshops represent direct forms of engagement       with policy-makers and service providers/users, helping to consolidate       HPP's networking across the public and voluntary sectors, including       faith-based organizations.
Such events have included:            London Buddhist Vihara       Training day for staff from Hafan Wen Detox Centre, CAIS, &amp; AVOW       AA UK Board Annual Seminar, presentations on HPP and TSF       Quaker Action on Alcohol and Drugs Annual Workshop, presentation on         HPP       Recovery Academy Symposium, workshop on `Championing Recovery'       Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust Spirituality and         Mental Health Symposium       Rhoserchan Treatment Centre, Aberystwyth       Castle Craig Treatment Hospital, Scotland       Parkview Treatment Centre, Liverpool       Public Health England       Consultation Event on Welsh Government's Recovery Strategy hosted by         AA for Professionals and AMs at the Senedd in Cardiff          Public Engagement and Social Media extend the reach of HPP's       influence across researchers', service-users' and practitioners' forums:            HPP has more than 1,200 followers on Twitter.
The 350 strong database receiving regular updates range from         policy-makers, TSF board members, research funders, addictions         professionals, social and healthcare workers, to addicts in recovery.
More than 100 addicts/alcoholics in 12-Step recovery globally have         expressed an interest in participating in the HPP study.
Dossett appeared on BBC Radio 4 "Beyond Belief" 18/03/2013 on a panel         speaking about spirituality and addiction recovery.

Research Partnerships are an indication of HPP's       contribution to practice in the form of policy initiatives and will       generate further evidence-based evaluation in collaboration with a range       of stake-holders:             Wrexham Recovery from Addiction Pilot Project (WRAPP): a         partnership project with Wrexham County Council and its service         provider, AVOW, to trial Twelve-Step Facilitation with twenty clients         with substance misuse issues.
This intervention could be extended across         the UK and play a significant role in the delivery of the Government's         new recovery policy.
AHRC Collaborative Doctoral Award: joint application with         Castle Craig Hospital which proposes PhD studentships starting in 2014.
Projects will explore spiritual dimensions of recovery in the UK's best         known treatment hospitals, and will produce industry &#8212; relevant         findings.
Life in Recovery: discussions are underway with Monash         University (Melbourne) to roll out David Best's Life in Recovery         project, http://www.facesandvoicesofrecovery.org/publications/life_in_recovery_survey.php,         with HPP participants.

Indicative Impact            Addictions professionals across North Wales are now more likely to         suggest TS participation.
This significant culture change, resulting         from a better informed professional community, is evidenced by local AA         groups reporting more members from treatment services, and the HPP         winning a bid (WRAPP) to enable TSF training.
Preparations are in hand for an AA `Conference Question' on engaging         more closely with the treatment profession.
It is significant that a         presentation from the HPP resulted in the initiation of this process,         leading potentially to substantial culture change within AA itself         towards greater engagement with the recovery agenda.
