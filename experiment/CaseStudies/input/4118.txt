     The central product of this research is the TRACK software package, which       is freely available for download (http://www.nerc-essc.ac.uk/~kih/TRACK/Track.html).
TRACK's impact has global reach because storm risks to people and property       occur in many areas of the world, demonstrated by the uptake of the TRACK       software, which has been downloaded by more than 40 institutes worldwide,       including operational weather forecast centres, academic researchers, and       "application users" (particularly in the insurance and weather forecasting       sectors).
Because it is freely available, we do not know the full extent       of TRACK's usage and some applications we know of are in highly       competitive commercial sectors and remain confidential.
Specific examples       of its use (in partnership with the Unit) are highlighted in more detail       below, but on-going support requests19 indicate more widespread       use.
The significance of the applications of TRACK is very high and it has       contributed to novel quantitative analysis in the insurance sector as well       as insights for policy- making and operational model development.
TRACK's       impact is subtle in some cases because TRACK is primarily an enabling tool       (providing users with new ways to access and interpret storm data) rather       than a specific scientific conclusion.
TRACK has nevertheless made novel       quantitative storm analyses possible in a wide variety of weather and       climate datasets, including in- house datasets owned by the end-users       themselves.
The specific examples of TRACK usage discussed here fall into 3       categories: (1) use of TRACK to improve storm forecasts for the offshore       industry; (2) use of TRACK to construct catalogues of storm events for use       by the insurance industry in understanding risk and how it is changing;       and (3) the use of TRACK to guide the improvement and use of climate       simulation models.
BMT ARGOSS is a subsidiary       of the BMT Group and is a leading maritime consultancy and weather       forecast company, providing offshore forecasts to customers including oil       and gas companies, transport companies, jetty operators, Liquid Natural       Gas sites and dredgers.
It has a strong collaboration with the Unit, where       it funds a Professorship.
Through this BMT learnt early of the Unit's work       on storm forecasting and our conclusion (based on TRACK) that storms       typically move more rapidly than estimated in weather forecast models.18       As a result, since 2009 their in- house meteorologists have used TRACK to       produce improved weather-forecast products for maritime emergency response       and vessel routing.
24 For example, they now make improved       estimates of storm arrival times at offshore oil rigs, thereby increasing       the reliability of safety margins and decreasing the time that operations       need to be shut-down due to extreme weather.
A senior consultant and       project manager states:22 "Customers require storm warnings         alongside the regular weather forecasts.
These dedicated forecasts         cannot be produced reliably based on a single model, requiring more         specialized tools.
The TRACK software suite provides us with this         capability.
Currently the TRACK software is run operationally at BMT         ARGOSS, 4 times per day.
TRACK is becoming an essential part of our         modelling infrastructure.
It allows us to focus on the development of         customer-specific products, and the development of a sustainable service".
A Maritime Meteorologist with BMT23 notes that TRACK is "particularly         useful for our customers, such as dredging vessels or towing, that need         to shelter for tropical cyclones and particularly for the high wind         speed and wave height associated with it.
We use the tracking software         to identify storms at an early stage and advise our customers about wind         speed and wave height.
We use the ensembles to assess the most likely         track of the cyclone and whether or not the wind speed and wave height         are expected to reach certain thresholds" and that "We generate         cyclone bulletins based on the ensembles.
Particularly the expected         ground track and estimated wind speed are of great importance to our         customers such as vessels, rigs or ports".
TRACK is also influencing       the future development of BMT's services: e.g., it is being used to       generate statistics to improve typhoon warnings.
Froude (NERC Knowledge       Exchange fellow) and Hodges provided extensive support to BMT-ARGOSS over       the last 5 years in applying TRACK with weather-forecast data.19     Storms are extremely important to the global insurance and reinsurance       sectors.20 In 2012, for example, storms produced global       insured losses of $54bn and accounted for 75% of total insured       losses.21 Hence storms are a key risk for insurance exposure.
Insurance companies need to quantify the risk posed by storms in order to       assess exposure and set premiums, and this requires an understanding of       the frequency and characteristics of storm events.
Willis is one of the "big       three" global insurance brokers dealing with weather and climate       catastrophe risk.
Working in partnership with Willis since       2006 through the Willis Reinsurance Network, the Unit has used TRACK to       derive a catalogue of tropical cyclones.
Willis has used this in the       development of its Tropical Cyclone Laboratory (TC Lab), a decision-making       tool for brokers that combines observational and model data to identify       robust evidence of evolving weather and climate risk, and acknowledge the       invaluable input from the Unit.25 The relationship between the       Unit and Willis includes a Knowledge Transfer Partnership fellow (Dr J.       Strachan), who was directly embedded with Willis' Natural Catastrophe       Modelling and Product Development teams.
Her work led to a broader       understanding of the effects of climate variability and change on extreme       events within Willis and, in particular, the need for robust long-term       catalogues of tropical storm events to better assess present and future       insurance risk.
TRACK has also been instrumental in the production of the Extreme Wind       Storm (XWS) catalogue in collaboration with the Met.
Office, Exeter       University and Willis.26 This catalogue of historical       extratropical wind storms, including footprints of their damaging winds,       has recently been made freely available but has been designed for use in       the insurance industry in particular.
The impact of the catalogue itself       will be considerable but has yet to happen; however, the collaboration to       develop it demonstrates how the application of TRACK is changing planning       in the insurance industry.
For example, in a study made possible only by       the TRACK software, staff of Willis and Exeter University have studied the       implications of clustering of windstorms for the insurance industry and       discuss the scale of the associated losses.27 A Willis briefing       document notes "These results will be of interest to insurers         and reinsurers focussed on more accurate, actuarially-sound risk         management of European windstorms, particularly those with         spatially-extended portfolios and exposure in NW Europe".
28     Risk Management Solutions (RMS)       is one of 3 major international catastrophe modelling companies providing       services to insurance and reinsurance companies.
RMS use TRACK to analyse       storms simulated by their in-house climate modelling and historical       datasets.
The storm tracks are used with their proprietary catastrophe       model in their wind-storm risk assessment model which is widely used in       the insurance sector within the UK and internationally.34 The       Unit is also currently working with the global insurance company, Hiscox,       to improve understanding of their exposure to Atlantic hurricane risks.
They have supported MSc and PhD projects in the Unit on the applications       of TRACK .29      The UK Met Office runs one of the world's leading climate models,       which has developed over time from the late 1980s to the current       generation HadGEM2 family of models.
The models have featured in all       assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), are       used to support policy advice provided by the Met Office to the UK       government, and provided the basis for the climate scenarios (UKCIP98,       UKCIP02 and UKCP09) used in the vast majority of assessments of the       impacts of climate change in the UK.
Many research projects and activities       have supported the development over time of the Met Office climate model,       and TRACK has played a part in this development.30 The Met       Office use the TRACK software and analysis package to assess the ability       of models to reproduce storm characteristics, such as their track,       frequency and intensity31,32, and to show that increasing the       spatial resolution of the climate model led to considerably improved       representation of storms.
HadGEM2 runs at double the spatial resolution       and the use of TRACK provided further support for improving resolution.32       The Met Office also use TRACK with their model simulations of future       climate to assess potential changes in storm characteristics in targeted       regional studies.33 A testimonial letter30 from the       Met Office's Manager of global high resolution modelling list the many       uses that they make of TRACK and concludes "Overall, TRACK is a very         important component of our model assessment and development suite"     Background information     19.
