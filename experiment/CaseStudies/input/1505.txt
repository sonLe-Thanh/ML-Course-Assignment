     Hutchinson has actively engaged in a range of activities directed towards       public interest in and       understanding of science, to ensure active translation of his research       across an array of topics and       techniques.
The public is widely receptive to the extinct and/or highly       appealing animals such as       dinosaurs and elephants that this research features, as well as the       cutting-edge technologies such       as 3D computer modelling, biomechanics, motion capture and medical imaging       involved.
The work       has inspired or informed international television documentaries and two       major museum exhibits       since 2008, delivering wide reach across Europe and North America.
The "Inside Nature's Giants" documentary series, first screened on       Channel 4 in 2009, had 1.2-2       million viewers per episode in the UK, and won the 2010 BAFTA award in the       Specialist Factual       category [a].
The National Geographic channel also bought the series,       increasing the potential       reach to 160 million homes in 143 countries.
Hutchinson was a consultant       for the programme,       editing scripts and providing 60 hours of paid scientific/technical       expertise as well as appearing       onscreen in 2 episodes and giving acknowledged input on the website       content.
His invitation to act       as a consultant on this production was a direct result of the scientific       publications on elephant       locomotion and his personal interactions with zoos and elephant keepers       during the research.
Three further series have followed, with episodes broadcast on PBS in the       USA in 2012.
Since       2011, a book, DVDs and iPad App have been sold based on the programmes.
The RVC research was featured in the "Dino Gangs" documentary on       the Discovery Channel,       which aired worldwide, with the work on theropod growth and speed also       referenced in the       accompanying book [b].
Other programmes covering the team's work include "Evolutions"       (National Geographic, 2008), "Raw Anatomy" (National Geographic       Channel, 2009) and `How to         build a Dinosaur" (BBC4, 2011) [c].
Hutchinson's expertise and publications in the field of dinosaur       locomotion have led to       contributions to the design of interactive exhibits produced for extensive       museum tours.
He was       the Chief Palaeontology Advisor, providing the main quality control on       scientific evidence, for the       `Be The Dinosaur' travelling museum exhibit, which includes an       immersive multi-player video       experience, and which has toured 25 museums in the USA and Canada since       2008.
Testimonials       on the website of the exhibit's creators include museum curators reporting       increased attendance       ("We had a 9% increase in attendance over the previous summer while         many other Museums in         our State experienced a drop in attendance over the same timeframe."
Executive Director, Mid-America       Science Museum), together with visitor enthusiasm ("...this exhibit         was a huge hit with         both kids and adults, resulting in a noticeable increase in attendance."
Vice-President of Exhibits       and Operations, The Children's Museum of the Upstate).
Testimonials also       commented on quality       content ("... engaging interactive technology, a wealth of scientific         information collected by experts         in the field of Paleontology, and an unforgettable learning experience."
Marketing and Exhibits       Manager, ETSU/Gen) and positive educational value ("The educational         content was superb and         the best part was that young and old alike learned about science in a         hands-on way."
Director of       Education, "Queen of Discovery", GWIZ &#8212;; The Science Museum) [d].
The RVC research on giant animals was explained and featured prominently       as part of a second       travelling museum exhibit, "Dinosaurs: Ancient Fossils, New Discoveries",       which has attracted       approximately 1.5 million visitors spread across 10 museums on two       continents since 2008 [e].
The writer/producer from the American Museum of Natural History, who       produced the `Walking         with T. rex' video within the exhibition, commented: "The         exhibition demonstrates to visitors that         scientists are still debating and arguing about evidence ... Theropod         Biomechanics, utilizing         Professor Hutchinson's research findings, is an integral section of the         exhibition... YouTube video         of the `walking' mechanical T. rex from the exhibition has been posted         by a member of the public,         receiving 8,700 views [9,500 by 7/13], with written commentary and         comments indicating real         engagement with the science."
[f]     Hutchinson is regularly directly involved at RVC in engagement with the       public and, especially,       school-age audiences: e.g.
He presented his research to 30 Year-10       students (mostly black and       minority ethnic and all from lower socio-economic groups) at the RVC in       July 2011.
In feedback       given by them after their visit, 100% said they aimed to attend university       and that this Summer       School session had strengthened this attitude [g].
In 2012, Hutchinson's nomination to deliver the Charles Darwin Award       lecture at the British       Science Festival in Aberdeen was successful [h].
The lecture theatre was       fully booked (250       attendees) for the highly interactive presentation (incorporating the Be         The Dinosaur simulation),       with many visitors staying on to ask questions and examine specimens, plus       subsequent       discussion via Twitter.
All feedback responses rated the event `good' or       `excellent, with a good       level of understanding regarding overall research results [i].
The research has received extensive media coverage [j] and Hutchinson is       also highly active via       social media &#8212; blog and twitter &#8212; to promote discussion of his research       [k].
Views of the `What's in         John's Freezers' blog average 100-200 per day, and peaked at 10,564       in April 2012, after posting       stills from the Inside Nature's Giants footage of elephant       dissection [l].
The `Chicken of the Future' website and blog discusses the current       research project addressing       health problems of broilers [m].
The project has in-kind support from       Cobb-Vantress, the world's       leading broiler breeding business, and follows pilot studies supported by       the company, in a CASE       studentship on how the biomechanics of fast growing birds leads to leg       health problems.
The Director of Global Animal Welfare at Cobb-Vantress Inc. commented: ".
When we were         introduced to Professor John Hutchinson's research on Tyrannosaurus         growth and movement, we         made an unexpected connection to our commercial concerns in         bird-rearing.
The limbs of the         dinosaur and chicken have remarkable resemblance and although they         differ vastly in scale, their         growth from hatching to mature size may be subject to similar         stresses... we hope this will         ultimately contribute to solutions for opportunities in continuous         improvement in the health and         well-being of broilers and broiler breeders in the global poultry         industry, while also providing         enhanced economic benefits for producers."
[n]     Since 2005, Hutchinson has been working with a number of zoos and safari       parks in order to       improve management of elephants in captivity.
The Curator of Colchester       Zoo commented:       "RVC's research into the locomotion of large animals has underpinned         our studies...
Intractable         problems of foot health have been one of the most common causes of death         and euthanasia for         elephants in captivity.
Over 70 elephants are kept ... in the UK and         Ireland, and Defra has         commissioned research into the welfare, housing and husbandry of the UK         population.
If zoos and         safari parks do not improve their conditions for elephants, they risk         losing them altogether... Our         collaboration has led to ways of monitoring gait for abnormalities that         may indicate discomfort from         infection, disease or damage at the earliest stage and so assist in         addressing these problems         promptly...
These methods of gait analysis and foot inspection are now         becoming standardised         and are being disseminated as best practice across the zoological         community internationally."
