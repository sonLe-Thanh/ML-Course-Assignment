     Policing and broader criminal justice responses to crime have       traditionally focussed on catching offenders post offence, and       administering punishments to deter future offending.
Against the grain of       this bias towards reactive approaches, the mission of SCS has been to       develop models of evidence-based crime prevention policies and practices.
Through direct engagement of end users, SCS has had significant impacts in       helping to redress this bias.
These have been felt both on broader crime       prevention policies and routine policing practices, and on specific crime       problems.
Informing and influencing policy and practice in the UK and           overseas     Crime prevention policies in the UK have been strongly influenced by SCP       and POP, and SCS research has played an important role in this.
The       research findings showing the effectiveness of these approaches have been       conveyed to policymakers through knowledge exchange activities, testimony       to select committees, and membership of key advisory bodies.
In 2010, for       example, Laycock drew on SCS research when she appeared before the House       of Commons Select Committee on Home Affairs to argue for the greater use       of situational crime prevention.
In its subsequent report to Parliament       later that year the Committee responded directly to Laycock's testimony       welcoming "the renewed emphasis given to designing-out crime in the         Cutting Crime strategy and the establishment of the Home Secretary's         Design and Technology Alliance" [1, p. 55].
Since 2011, Wortley has contributed to the Minister's Forum for       Innovation in Crime Prevention, which helps shape government policy on       crime prevention.
A letter from the Home Office states: "The work of         the Department and its advocacy for, and expertise in, situational crime         prevention strategies are well known by officials responsible for Crime         policy within the Home Office and to the experts within my own area,         Home Office Science, whose task it is to ensure that we provide the best         evidence on which to base policy developments".
As an example it is       noted that "at a recent Forum `away-day' he [Wortley] led a session on         preventing theft from the person, which is one of the only crime types         to have increased recently, and in particular focussed on the need to         convert good ideas for prevention into concrete policies and practices"       [2].
SCS staff also have worked directly with police forces and crime         prevention agencies internationally, through continuing professional       development courses, workshops, seminars, consultancy, and the provision       of advice to provide concrete examples of how SCP and POP may be       implemented in practice.
For example, in 2003 the New Zealand Police       approached researchers at the SCS for assistance with their implementation       of evidence-based crime prevention policies.
Since 2008, SCS staff have       visited New Zealand on three occasions: in 2010 Laycock contributed to a       research symposium at the NZ Police College; in 2012 Chainey spent 3 weeks       delivering training courses to NZ police across the country; and in 2013,       Laycock spent a month delivering specialist workshops to police analysts       and leaders (totalling over 20 seminars and 400 participants).
The New       Zealand Police explicitly credits SCS with a significant role in shaping       their crime strategies and helping to reduce crime: "The Jill Dando         institute (JDI) has made a significant contribution to the development         of crime science and intelligence led policing in New Zealand.
We are         grateful to JDI staff and associates who have increased our knowledge         base, contributed to the development of our key products and         fundamentally helped evolve the mindset within the New Zealand Police         over the last 10 years...Over the past 4 years we have achieved sizeable         reductions in crime against a backdrop of very high (and improving)         levels of public trust and confidence in Police" [4].
The adoption       of crime science strategies has received extensive coverage in New       Zealand's media, wherein the role of the SCS is explicitly acknowledged,       arguably contributing to the reported increased levels of public       confidence in police [4].
Facilitating reductions in specific crimes     The impacts of our work on bike theft [c, d] have been       particularly significant given the emphasis placed by health authorities       and governments on promoting greater use of bicycles to improve health and       reduce congestion.
The British Crime Survey (2010/11) indicates that some       500,000 bicycles are stolen every year.
The SCS/CSM collaborative research       has had significant impacts on helping to reduce that number.
Following       the demonstration of improved locking practices associated with CaMden       bike stands, manufacture of the new stands was undertaken by Broxap Ltd       who have reported that 1,202 were rolled out nationally between 2008-13       [6].
In recognition of this project, Johnson and colleagues were invited       to write a Problem Oriented Policing guide (POP Guide 52) for the US       Department of Justice POP Center on Bicycle Theft [5].
This has proven an       important source of information for national and international crime       prevention professionals operating in this area, having been downloaded       more than 11,000 times per year since its publication in 2008 (according       to popcenter.org).
Bike theft became a focus for Transport for London       (TfL) and the London Metropolitan Police, and with the assistance of SCS       they undertook a prevention project.
A letter from TfL [7] states: `The         academic work undertaken by the JDI became the starting point for our         cycle theft project, particularly the POP Guide 52: Bicycle Theft ....
Using a partnership approach we achieved a 5.4% decrease in cycle theft         in London during 2010/11 (1253 fewer offences).
The         approach has been recognised internationally and was awarded the 2011         Herman Goldstein (award) for Excellence in Problem Oriented Policing'.
Largely due to increased media coverage, internal child sex         trafficking has, in recent years, been widely recognised in the UK       as a pressing public issue.
SCS research has challenged the perception,       dominating public debate, that internal sex trafficking is a racially       motivated crime [e, f].
Extensive media coverage of the research by, among       others, Newsnight, Huffington Post, Guardian, Independent [8], has       extended the reach of the research and informed public understanding of       the issues.
Through these and other contributions to the development of a       lively national debate, the SCS research has also influenced the       formulation of national policies on tackling this issue, including the       Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) Thematic       Assessment, `Out of Mind, Out of Sight' (2011); Metropolitan Police       Authority Report on Child Sexual Exploitation (2011); and the UK National       Action Plan on Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation (2001) [9].
SCS enjoys a       fruitful relationship with SOCA (now NCA), supported both by research       student internships with the Agency and by Brayley's status (since 2013)       as a fulltime investigator.
The practical value of the research is       acknowledged by the Agency: "Of particular value in recent years has         been the work done by the Department around the topic of Internal Child         Sex Trafficking (ICST)...
In 2010, SOCA actively supported two research         projects carried out by Professor Gloria Laycock with two masters         students, Ella Cockbain and Helen Brayley.
One project examined the         social networks of offenders and victims and the other deconstructed the         offence into a `crime script'.
The research has been influential in         helping to shape SOCA's response to ICST" [6].
Drawing on the body of SCP research carried out within the SCS, and       working within the partnership models outlined by Tilley [a, b], staff       have shared their expert advice with police forces, crime       prevention practitioners, and criminal justice policy makers, both       domestically and abroad.
