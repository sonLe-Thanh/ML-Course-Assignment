     McKee's research has directly impacted on the awareness and practice of       senior non-academic       stakeholders across the UK and Ireland.
A Knowledge Transfer Partnership       with NHS Grampian       led to substantial savings for the Health Board there [2d; 5.7].
Research-in-action workshops:       These served a dual purpose: feeding back findings to research       participants; and informing NHS       actions and raising awareness of the research issue.
This knowledge       exchange increased the       `pull' of the research and multiplied its reach.
For example, research       from the Safe Places [2a]       project was presented at the Research in Action Workshop for Research         Participants:         Understanding the Dynamics of Organisational Culture Change in       Birmingham in 2009.
Participants included senior managers from 7 of the 8 Acute Trusts,       including CEOs and three       nominated senior quality and safety managers from each.
Participants       responded well, with all       reporting the workshop useful in building bridges between researchers and       NHS staff: 84% said it       had been `excellent or very good' for that purpose.
[5.1]     Another complementary example was a session presented at Delivering         Better Health Services,       the Health Services Research Network (HSRN) and NIHR SDO joint annual       conference in       Manchester in 2010, with over 100 health managers, practitioners and       researchers.
Reflecting on       both events in her role as a non-academic in the project, Christine Miles       (then Director at the       Department of Health, Wales and previously a Hospital CEO, now Director of       Operations, Airedale       FT NHS Trust) said: `This and the SDO conference were great         opportunities to enable interfacing         between (the) academic world and NHS' She adds `When reading the         report, I realised how much         research can provide us with potential solutions to better care; and in         the light of the Francis report         it is so topical; and only the other day I was revisiting the findings         of our research.'
[5.1; 5.6].
A similar research-in-action workshop increased the impact of the Irish/Scottish         Project [2b].
From Policy to Practice: an international comparison of approaches to         systemic quality and safety,       took place at Dublin City University Business School in 2012, with 25       attendees, including       clinicians and managers from participating hospitals, senior Board       representatives, government       officials from both countries, senior managers from QIS and a       representative of the Scotland       Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN).
Commenting on the impact,       Professor Noel Whelan,       Chairman of the Board of Directors, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, Dublin       said: `The research         insights generated have led to new ways of interpreting and dealing with         quality improvement         initiatives.
St. Vincent's University hospital is a direct beneficiary         of this work and acknowledges its         relevance and importance' [5.8] Dr. David Steel, former CEO of QIS,       stated:  `...the project has         produced findings that not only add significantly to the evidence base         on quality and safety         improvement but have also been welcomed by practitioners as useful and         relevant (and timely         following the Francis report on failings at Mid-Staffordshire)'       [5.2; 5.7].
Knowledge transfer partnerships (KTPs):       A local feedback event for the KTP with NHS Grampian (2d, 2010) targeted       20 stakeholders,       including consultants, GPs, nursing and managerial staff.
A high-level       meeting was also held to       discuss the project with Dr. Kevin Woods, the then Director General of NHS       Scotland, and the local       health board CEO.
This knowledge partnership was a finalist in the 2012       Knowledge Partnership       Scotland awards, with both commercial and organisational impact, making       total savings of       &#163;237,000 for the Health Board.
Other impacts related to development of       clinical leadership skills:       bringing `a positive outlook for accepting and managing future change'.
Jillian Evans, Head of       Health Intelligence at NHS Grampian commented, `Since the KTP, the         industrial supervisor, a         Consultant in Endoscopy, has enhanced his leadership role in the wider         organisation and is now         leading NHS Grampian's Transforming Outpatients Programme'.
[5.3;       5.9]     Direct policy advice and expert commentary to government:     In 2007, McKee was involved in an independent evaluation of the role and     impact of the NHS     Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS), a new public body.
Implemented from 2008     onwards, the     resulting report &#8212; as confirmed by Dr. David Steel, former QIS Chief     Executive &#8212; `led to a significant       refocusing of the organisation's efforts toward active support of       improvement activities in the       service, of which the pioneering Scottish Patient Safety Programme (SPSP)       was a... very high       profile example'.
He adds: `Professor's McKee's expertise in the       evaluation of complex       organisations...was invaluable in ensuring the...credibility of the       analysis that was undertaken,       which was a major factor in the Board's assessment of the validity of the       recommendations that       emerged from it'.
[5.4; 5.7] In 2010-2013 McKee was co-PI on a NIHR     Department of Health     Policy Research Programme (2a: reference No 0770017) directly addressing     patient safety     cultures and the importance of clear, challenging goals for high-quality     care, with organisations     putting the patient at the centre of all they do, getting smart     intelligence, focusing on improving     organisational systems, and nurturing caring cultures by ensuring that staff     feel valued, respected,     engaged and supported [2a; 5.5].
