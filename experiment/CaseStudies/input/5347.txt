     Impacts include: commercial, practitioners, health and welfare     Main beneficiaries include: patients, practitioners, Industry     Following European CE and US FDA approvals of Habib&#8482; 4X, an exclusive       licence was negotiated with Rita Medical Systems, USA, now known as       AngioDynamics Inc, USA to market the device worldwide.
The total number of       units sold (2005-Q2 2013) is 23,723 accruing $48 million in revenues for       AngioDynamics.
Since the US launch of the Habib 4X it has captured 85% of       the US hepatic RF resection market and has captured 30% of the total US       hepatic resection market.
Similarly, a smaller device, the Habib&#8482; 2X,       introduced in 2007, has captured 20% of the partial kidney resection       market in the USA.
More recently, the Habib&#8482; 4X Laparoscopic device,       developed by the Imperial team and marketed by AngioDynamics, is being       sold to urology surgeons performing keyhole kidney surgery.
The Habib 4X overcomes the well-established difficulties of significant       blood loss encountered when removing tumours from organs with a propensity       to bleed profusely.
Initially, the device was developed to improve       outcomes in liver surgery, but the device has been successfully deployed       in other vascular tissues such as kidney, spleen, pancreas, uterus and       lung.
An independent published randomised clinical trial comparing       radiofrequency assisted parenchymal transection with the traditional       clamp-crushing technique showed a reduction in blood loss and lower       morbidity using the radiofrequency assisted resection [1]).
Other       publications have also shown similar reduction in blood loss.
Two recent       independently UK published data leads us to believe that the use of the       Habib 4X improves outcomes: (i) UK Cancer Information Service 2011       recorded Imperial as having the best one and two year relative survival of       liver patients of the London Cancer Networks (Figure 1); (ii) Dr Foster       Intelligence Data showed that Imperial has the lowest in-hospital 30 day       mortality risk for patients undergoing liver resection in England and       Wales which is probably due to the use of the RF assisted technique       (Figure 2).
These results led the premier liver surgery unit in the UK to       now use exclusively the Habib 4X for liver resection surgeries.

Since 2008, the following devices have been developed, CE approved (FDA       510[k] approval has also been obtained for the Habib&#8482; EndoHPB [2009]) and       generated revenue [2, 3]:            Habib&#8482; EndoHPB (for palliation of biliary and pancreatic tumours in         the common bile duct and liver): CE mark approval in 2009; income to         date &#163;998,807       Habib&#8482; Percutaneous HPB (a percutaneous RF catheter for rapid ablation         of solid tumours): CE mark approval in 2009; income to date &#163;177,747       Habib&#8482; VesOpen (for vascular remodelling and opening of vessel that         have become stenosed or occluded): CE mark approval 2009; income to date         &#163;5,5587       Habib&#8482; RF Duo (to cauterise and coagulate tissue in the liver and         pancreas): CE mark approval 2013; income to date &#163;114,918          In light of the success of EMcision, PROFIT magazine ranked the company       as 14th on it `Hot 50' definitive ranking of Canada's Top New       Growth Companies for 2013 (two-year revenue growth, 1067%) [4].
The HabibTM EndoHPB has also recently been reviewed at the       NICE Interventional Procedures Committee [5].
NICE will report following       publication of randomised clinical trial outcomes.
