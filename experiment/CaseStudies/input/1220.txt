     The research has had impacts on a wide range of audiences: from UK       Parliament, local authorities, non-governmental organisations, wildlife       and gardening organisations, charities, gardeners and members of the       public.
The research findings have been used in many contexts from       advisory publications and reports, to planning applications and campaigns.
It is notable that in many of the situations where it is used in evidence,       the BUGS project is the only primary scientific research cited, reflecting       its unique role as the first and only large-scale study of its kind to       date.
The BUGS project provided evidence for: (i) the magnitude and importance       of gardens as a habitat in urban areas [R3, R6]; (ii) the high       biodiversity in gardens, which were historically considered as `ecological       deserts', [R1, R4-R5] and (iii) the features that make a       garden good for wildlife [R2].
This evidence has been cited as       evidence for policy positions in a range of contexts, as illustrated       below.
Policy, Planning &amp; Practice     One of the BUGS project leaders, Kevin Gaston, was a lead author in the       chapter of the UK National Millennium Ecosystem Assessment       Technical Report on Urban systems, and BUGS publications are used in       evidence in the section on gardens.
BUGS research was used in evidence to Parliament: The Royal Horticultural       Society, in a written memorandum to the Parliamentary Select Committee on       Environmental Audit (2008), used results from BUGS papers to support the       evidence it was submitting [S1].
Two of the six papers they cite in       their evidence (the only two scientific papers) are from the BUGS project       [R3, R4].
The Local Biodiversity Action Plans developed by Local Authorities, in       partnership with relevant organisations, which identify local priorities       for biodiversity conservation and work to deliver agreed actions for       priority habitats and species, often cite the BUGS project as evidence of       the importance of gardens and their management for biodiversity (e.g.,       Kensington &amp; Chelsea (2010), Norfolk Biodiversity Partnership -       Allotments, (2012); London Biodiversity Partnership - Private Gardens       (2008); Tees Valley Biodiversity Partnership - Gardens and Allotments       (2012); Edinburgh Biodiversity in Parks and Green Spaces (undated)) [S2].
This demonstrates direct practical application to local conservation       planning.
The project has also been used as supporting evidence in       planning and ecological impact/mitigation documents (e.g.
biodiversity       management plans [S3] and local planning applications [S4]).
The BUGS project has also had direct influences on the thinking that       underpins the design and implementation of urban landscape planting.
The       high-profile planting of the 2012 Olympic Park in London - featured widely       in the media - drew on BUGS science:     We've based our design and species choices on scientific research.
Evidence for the value of urban gardens and native/exotic vegetation         mixes to native invertebrates has come from projects like Biodiversity         in Urban Gardens (BUGS), which investigated the variety of living things         that city gardens support, and the complex relationships between them.
[S5]     This use of the BUGS project work is recorded as a noteworthy impact of       NERC science in NERC's 2012 Impact Report [S5].
Reaching a public audience     The BUGS research is relevant to multiple audiences, with one of those       being the public, and gardeners specifically.
Consequently, impact is       likely to be through sometimes small, but widespread, changes in the       garden management practices of individuals.
Accessible publication of the       results is key to this impact.
The results provided the scientific basis       of a very successful popular science book (18,500 copies sold) written by       Dr Ken Thompson, one of the project leaders (now retired):     Thompson K (2006) No Nettles Required: the truth about wildlife         gardening.

This cheerful hand grenade of a         book debunks the myth that wildlife gardening needs large gardens,         native species and beds of stinging nettles ...
Fantastic science         writing for a lay audience... (New Scientist 2006).
The BUGS project website (www.bugs.group.shef.ac.uk)       has been active since the first phase of the project, and consistently       receives 400-700 visits per month, with links coming from       websites as diverse as the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), BBC,       Wildlife Trusts, wildlife discussion forums and gardening blogs.
Approximately           half the visits are from outside the UK, showing its strong international           reach.
Reference to the project, and the website as a source of information on       the science behind wildlife gardening, occur in a number of popular       wildlife gardening books: e.g.
Collins Wildlife Gardener, Stephan       Buczacki (2007), RSPB Gardening for Wildlife Adrian Thomas (2010).
To quote from the introduction to the latter:     ... in 1982 the RSPB produced a book called Gardening for Wildlife.
So         why another one now?
Well the science has been moving forwards,         including pioneering work by the Biodiversity in Urban Gardens (BUGS)         project in Sheffield.
There are more ideas now than ever to get your         teeth into...     All these provide evidence of the effective dissemination of the         results to those likely to make actual practical changes to their garden         management practice in the UK and overseas.
Impacts of this sort are         small individually, but collectively very important.
Advice and advocacy     The results from the BUGS project played a significant role in the       development of advice on, and promotion of, the value of gardens for       biodiversity on the websites, and activities of the statutory bodies       involved in the project, and a range of other organisations (such as the       RHS and Wildlife Trusts, e.g.
[S6]).
Subsequent initiatives to develop and influence gardening practice       acknowledge the key role that the project played, e.g., the Royal       Horticultural Society's Plants for Bugs project:     The Sheffield BUGS project was instrumental (an essential precursor)         both in inspiring and in the practice of the RHS Plants for Bugs (P4B)         project - have a look at the project page for P4B - BUGS papers cited         several times.
The BUGS project - in combination with Jennifer Owens'         30- year study - have clearly shown the value that gardens have for         wildlife.
[S7]     The second of the British Wildlife articles was co-written by the       project investigators and the representatives of the key agencies       involved, and the ideas from BUGS summarised in that article fed directly       into the development of the Wildlife Garden Manifesto [S8,S10],       produced by the Wildlife Gardening Forum, coordinated by Natural England       (discussed further below).
In addition to the statutory agencies, individual campaigns, for example       concerned with preventing the loss of gardens to development, also make       use of evidence from the project [S9].
Overall impact     As the examples above demonstrate, BUGS has had, and continues to have,       significant impacts on advice, policy and practice.
These are perhaps best       summarised in some quotations from an appraisal of BUGS from the Head of       the Wildlife Gardening Forum (WLGF) [S10]:     ... there is increasing recognition that gardens are the most         biodiverse part of urban Green Infrastructure.
Most of the credit for         this lies with the exemplary detailed work of the two BUGS campaigns,         which has provided the statistically sound evidence base that we are now         using to convince decision makers such as planners and local and         national government.
Evidence from BUGS moulded the WLGF's Manifesto, which was adopted by         Natural England and DEFRA, and launched in July 2007 by Sir Martin         Doughty, Chair of Natural England, supported by Joan Ruddock, Minister         for Biodiversity.
Subsequently the WLGF has submitted BUGS-generated         evidence to a number of Government consultations, including the White         Paper "The Natural Choice: securing the value of nature" [2011] which         extensively referenced the importance of garden habitats, and led to the         Government providing public funding for the "Big Wildlife Garden" scheme         now managed by the Royal Horticultural Society and The Wildlife Trusts.
Following submissions by the WLGF and its members, we were delighted         that the 2012 publication of the NPPF [National Planning Policy       Framework] did reinstate considerable recognition and protection for         the garden environment.
This would never have been possible without the         sound evidence base that the BUGS projects created.
In summary, the work of the Biodiversity in Urban Gardens studies has         revolutionised the ecological understanding of what we now recognise as         a key urban habitat, and this is reflected not only in action by         conservation agencies, but by national and local government, and         increasingly by studies in other countries.
There can be few studies         which can have practically single-handedly created a new ecological         discipline, but this is certainly true of BUGS.
