              In response to research team's recommendation to increase the         transparency of gender disaggregated data, Scottish Enterprise and         Highlands and Islands Enterprise (who were responsible for MAs at the         time) began to publish gender disaggregated data on MAs on their         websites.
The responsibility for MAs was transferred to Skills         Development Scotland (SDS) in 2008 and they now publish all data broken         down by gender on their website.
Another of the key recommendations made by the research         team was the establishment of a national strategy for tackling         occupational segregation in training and work.
Although the idea of a         national strategy was rejected by the (then) Scottish Executive, they         instead set up the Scottish Government Cross-Directorate Occupational         Segregation Working Group in 2006 (see Macpherson 2008) as a focus for         addressing occupational segregation in the labour market.
As a result of         the establishment of this group tackling occupational segregation has         became a key feature of Scottish government policy.
Scottish Ministers         identified occupational segregation as one of two priority areas for the         advancement of equality of opportunity between men and women, the other         being violence against women.
In 2012, the first ever Women's Employment Summit (WES) was held by the         Scottish Governmentin partnership with the Scottish Trades Unions         Congress (STUC).
Professor McKay gave a keynote         speech to the summit and was subsequently invited onto a Ministerial         Governance Group to take forward the recommendations of the WES which         agreed to revisit the original national strategy recommendation made by         the research team.
Through involvement in the WES and at the request of         the First Minister, the research team are collaborating with the         Scottish Government to bring forward a pilot project to address the         gender barriers to the uptake of MAs in the renewable energy sector.
This is regarded as a key sector for future growth in the Scottish         economy and the Scottish government is keen to ensure that there is a         suitability qualified workforce to take advantage of the opportunities         growth in this sector will present.
Since the publication of the research in 2005, the         research team have become recognised as experts in the area of         occupational segregation and the MA programme.
Emily Thomson was invited         to speak on occupational segregation and the Scottish MA programme at         the Apprenticeship and Training Summit in March 2011.
In February 2012,         the research was cited in the Scottish Parliament in an evidence session         to the Equal Opportunities Commission.
In March 2013 Professor McKay         delivered a keynote speech on addressing occupational segregation at the         Apprenticeship and Training Summit which was opened by the Minister for         Youth Employment Angela Constance MSP.
The research has impacted on the priorities of Skills Development         Scotland (SDS), who are responsible for the delivery of MAs.
This is         evidenced by their decision to offer a studentship sponsored with the         ESRC through the Scottish Doctoral Training Programme to investigate         gender and occupational segregation in MAs.
The research team has also         recently been successful in a bid to the ESRC under the Knowledge         Exchange Opportunity scheme on accounting for gender in the MA programme         in Scotland.
A key factor in securing the grant was the impact of         previous research by the team.
The bid was undertaken in partnership         with Close the Gap an organisation which works across Scotland with         employers and employees, to encourage and enable action to address the         gender pay gap.
There is clear evidence that this research has impacted on policy change         in respect to the setting up of the Occupational Segregation Working         Group, increased transparency of publicly available data broken down by         gender and in recognition of the research team as experts in the area.
The impact has been significant in term of its reach, because of the         published research outputs and there has been engagement at the highest         level of government and the wider policy making community in Scotland.
This engagement has ensured that the issue of occupational segregation         and the potential of the MA programme to tackle it has remained a live         issue.
The impact has been sustained over a number of years and the         research team has continued to influence the design and implementation         of the MA programme in Scotland based on original and ongoing research.
