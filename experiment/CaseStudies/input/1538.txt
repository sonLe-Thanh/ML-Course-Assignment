     Since 1997 SIRC has carried out the majority of UK Sport's research into       major events and has added value to the process via meta-evaluations, peer       reviewed journal articles, conference presentations, chapters in books,       and extensive media coverage.
The main impacts of this underpinning       research derive from the setting up of the eventimpacts website in 2010.
The overall impact of the research is that since 2010 it is common       practice for evaluation contracts to specify that the outputs must be       eventimpacts.com compliant.
Furthermore, the eventimpacts.com website now       acts as a growing public repository for research that uses the methods       advocated (http://www.eventimpacts.com/project/new-research/).
`Contractors carrying out research on our behalf are asked to use the         EventIMPACTS methodology which in turn gives us consistency of approach         and comparability of data across events.
We refer all event organisers         to the EventIMPACTS website, regardless of whether we fund them or not         and have also promoted the work internationally where it has been really         well received.'
Senior officer, EventScotland (source iii below)     Techniques used in, and findings from, SIRC's research have been       instrumental in facilitating the setting of property rights for major       events such that public sector bodies can conduct estimated Cost Benefit       Analysis exercises in advance of their investment to establish the extent       to which their investment represents value for money.
These estimates can       now be confirmed or refuted post event using actual data and the       evaluation framework detailed in eventimpacts.com.
The impact of this       economic impact forecasting model has enabled public sector bodies to       secure better value for money for their investments.
For example Sheffield       City Council used the outputs of SIRC's economic impact analyses to       determine the level of its investment in retaining the World Snooker       Championship in Sheffield until 2017:     `The SIRC research at the World Snooker Championship revealed just how         valuable the event was to the city with an annual injection of around         &#163;2.5m in visitor spending and place marketing value of over &#163;3m accruing         from 100+ hours of coverage on the BBC.
Faced with global competition to         prise the event away from Sheffield, we were able to use the SIRC         research to put together a package of funding and other benefits that         persuaded the promoters of the event to keep it in Sheffield.'
Senior officer, Sheffield City Council (source iv below)     Part of the impact of SIRC's research is that the eventimpacts.com       framework has been used in research by SIRC to benefit the knowledge and       planning of major events by the following: national governing bodies of       sport (e.g.
British Cycling 2010, 2 events in 2011, 2 events in 2012;       British Rowing 2005, 2008, 2011); local authorities (e.g.
Sheffield City       Council, World Snooker Championship 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011; Isle of Wight       Council, Isle of Wight Music Festival, 2008); national tourism agencies       (e.g.
Failte Ireland and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, 2010, 2011,       2012); and commercial events (Tour de France 2007 and planning for 2014;       London Marathon 2001 and 2010; and The Open Golf Championship 2010, 2011,       2012 and 2013.
Invariably the rationale for this research has been to       evaluate the effectiveness of the use of public funding.
The SIRC research       enables stakeholders to employ a theoretically sound approach that       provides a credible `at least' estimate that can be supported with an       audit trail of evidence.
`The economic impact measurement technique designed by the Sport Industry       Research Centre and outlined in Measuring Success: The economics &#8212; a guide       was first used in Northern Ireland at the World Boxing Championships in       2001.
This was one of the first major sports events to be held in Northern       Ireland after the Good Friday Agreement and there was strong interest in       both the economic and media profile impacts that the event would have on       Belfast.
The SIRC report proved to be very influential in setting a       benchmark for the type of information we needed to find out about the       impact of events.
Following the boxing event, the Northern Ireland Events       Company was established and for the first three years of its existence it       commissioned SIRC to evaluate the impact of events into which public money       was invested.
This was important research as prior to the Good Friday       Agreement there has been no tradition of attracting major sports events to       Northern Ireland.'
Senior officer, Sport Northern Ireland (source ii     below)     Research has also been made accessible to event organisers who normally       would be unable to access the expertise and resources to conduct event       evaluations.
The eventimpacts.com website provides users with the choice       to select basic, intermediate or advanced level analysis, depending on       their needs.
In addition the site has a built in economic impact       calculator which estimates the likely economic impact of an event subject       to users populating the calculator with key parameters about the scale of       any event.
This forecasting tool provides event organisers with robust       data about the wider value of their events, whilst simultaneously       providing funders with a test of reasonableness as to what an appropriate       scale of investment might be (sources ii, iii, iv).
National Governing       Bodies of Sport applying for funding from UK Sport's World Class Events'       Programme are encouraged to use this resource to support their cases.
`I think it would be fair to say that we are seeing increasing numbers         of potential event bidders or funding applicants using the economic         impact calculator to inform the economic forecasting aspects of their         submissions.
In addition, it has been very encouraging to see organisers         of some of our bigger events &#8212; e.g.
Ryder Cup and Rugby League World Cup &#8212; leaning 		heavily on eventIMPACTS in developing multi-stranded         evaluation studies of those events.'
Senior manager, UK Sport       (source i below)     Whilst most event impact research has been in sport, the principles are       transferable to other cultural events.
Indeed eventimpacts.com included       SIRC's research on the Edinburgh International Film Festival and the Pipe       Band World Championships 2009 held in Glasgow.
In 2010 SIRC was       commissioned by Arts Council England to validate an economic and social       return on investment model for the cultural sector.
This model is also       available online (http://www.eitoolkit.org.uk/).
The impact of this tool is that basic economic impact calculations have       been democratised so that even small scale event organisers can have       access to evaluation techniques of this type.
Since 2010 and underpinned by SIRC research, eventimpacts.com has been a       contributory factor in the following:            an increase in the number of events hosted in the UK; for example in         the period 2000 to 2007 UK Sport helped to support 9 major events per         year whereas in the period 2008 to 2013 this figure nearly doubled to an         average of 17 events per year.
: `The SIRC research and the Measuring           Success series have been instrumental in pursuing a policy of           attracting more major events to Northern Ireland as well as helping to           support the case for enhanced funding.'
Senior officer, Sport         Northern Ireland (source ii below)       an increase in public funding for events and continued recognition of         their value in a period of public expenditure cuts; for example in the         period 2000 to 2007 UK Sport invested an average of &#163;1.7m per year on         major sports events whereas in the period 2008 to 2013 this figure         nearly doubled to &#163;3.2m per year: `By enabling UK Sport to set clear           objectives for the Gold Event Series (GES) &#8212; its major events           programme for the period 2013-2019 &#8212; the research evidence collected           by UK Sport using eventIMPACTS approaches in 2010 and 2011 has been           instrumental in securing National Lottery investment of over &#163;27           million to help support the bidding and staging of targeted events           through this period.'
(source I below); `Recent research by           SIRC in Sheffield has shown the importance of sports events to the           local economy and has helped to protect this area of our work from the           worst of the austerity measures to reduce public spending.'
Senior         officer, Sheffield City Council (source iv below)       an increase in the number of agencies with a remit for bidding for and         staging events including national governing bodies, Regional Development         Agencies, local authorities and bespoke event special purpose vehicles         such as EventScotland: `Having robust data on the economic and           social impacts of major sports and cultural events has enhanced our           ability to make the case for staging events in Scotland.'
Senior         officer, EventScotland (source iii below)       a much greater understanding of the impact and value of major events         as demonstrated by the case studies and new research in         www.eventimpacts.com: `EventIMPACTS has also helped UK Sport to           develop a closer working relationship with Sport England in terms of           maximising the sports participation legacy of major events, with the           latter organisation now set to play a more prominent role than           previously in encouraging sports development opportunities linked to           events and signposting people who attend events to sporting           opportunities in their local community.
