     A number of impact outcomes have been identified by the client as arising       as a direct result of the research.
Following the report, the Public       Health Directorate at the North East Lincolnshire Council implemented       changes in the areas of staffing, strategy, and training and resources:     i) Staffing            A specific `Obesity Lead' was appointed to drive,         implement and evaluate the co- ordination of local services.
The employment of six staff (two of these were posts         that were due to finish but were retained on the basis of the research         findings).
These posts co-ordinate the programme for the reduction in         obesity through physical activity, healthier eating and emotional         well-being across the lifecycle.
Their purpose was to `embed skills or         tools into local areas, run by local volunteers or community people'         (research report, page 16).
Partnership development: there was a reconfiguration of         the partnership arrangements used to tackle obesity, which also led to         the employment of a further staff member dedicated to the co-ordination         of partnership roles and to work specifically on childhood obesity         prevention.
ii) Strategy             Local obesity strategies were developed, specific to         local requirements.
A `Healthy Weight' care pathway was established for 0         to 18 year olds in North-East Lincolnshire.
A new communications strategy for the obesity programme         was created, including the use of electronic media, to improve         communications at all levels of the programme.
Healthy eating opportunities: a new Healthy Choices         Award Scheme was introduced to enable and encourage food retailers to         offer healthier choices.
The introduction and implementation of a monitoring tool         took place to enhance ongoing evaluation of the strategy.
iii) Training and resources             Training: between 2009 and 2011 a skills package was         introduced for health professionals that comprised of four new         certificated courses and a series of guides that were produced for         health trainers.
Resource allocations to the obesity project were         enhanced, including the production of leaflets for both health workers         and clients, as well as the retention of resources that would otherwise         have been lost, for example, by establishing a library of advisory         documents.
In respect of health-worker behaviour change, workers         were trained in the wider understanding of the social and environmental         contexts of obesity, as well as lifecycle influences, to improve         efficacy of the obesity programme.
The Care Trust also considers that the research has had a beneficial       impact on obesity levels in North-East Lincolnshire, and research is       currently underway to investigate this further.
How the research led to impact     The research was commissioned specifically due to the considerable       challenge of tackling the obesity `epidemic' in the North-East       Lincolnshire area, and the research technical report was provided directly       to key decision-makers in the Care Trust in 2009.
It was also distributed       to a wide range of stakeholder groups accessing and using the Obesity       Prevention Strategy.
Wider dissemination and impact, beyond the North-East       Lincolnshire region, has been achieved through academic journal articles       and conference presentations, and this is also ongoing.
Nature, extent and dates of the impact     The changes noted above were implemented from 2010.
The project has also       stimulated local and regional debate relating to strategy monitoring,       collaborative service alliances, and marketing communication strategies,       which in turn led to further funding from North-East Lincolnshire Care       Trust allocated to the HART group to conduct additional research.
These       subsequent projects have included investigating the changes made as a       consequence of the research (currently ongoing), as well as further grants       to research other related strategies, such as the Food for Fitness Team       and Health Promotion Portfolio in North-East Lincolnshire.
In relation to       local and regional impact, the research has generated a strong working       relationship between the research team and the key regional agencies,       resulting in the team's input into strategic thinking in relation not only       to obesity programmes, but also to health promotion more generally in the       region.
The scope of the research is potentially international (with regard to       its relevance to obesity reduction strategies) as well as national, and       the School intends to develop this aspect in future work.
Findings have so       far been presented both in international journals and via an international       conference presentation.
