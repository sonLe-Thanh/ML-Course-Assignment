     The principal beneficiaries of this research are members of the Nd&#233;       community.
The impact has been largely cultural.
As a result of       Fear-Segal's research, the Nd&#233; learned the fate of their two lost children       and could put to rest a sense of loss and injustice that had gone       unresolved for generations.
This had been a constant reminder of the       suffering of the Apache people, who kept the memory of the children alive       for over a hundred years by annually re-telling the story at community       gatherings each August.
In the documentary, The Lost Ones,       Chairman Romero explains how, as a result of Fear-Segal's work, members of       his community can now move beyond those feelings of loss to claim a new       strength: "Fear-Segal...found our little ones.
The Nd&#233; will forever make       mention of her name in our traditional oral history, for finding the Lost       Ones.
The lives of the Nd&#233; become much richer with the knowledge that the       Lost Ones have come home in our hearts and minds.
Now the Lost Ones are       found, the Nd&#233; can again be strong as a people, they say" [Source 1].
Margo Tamez, an Nd&#233; historian and poet, suggests Fear-Segal has also       brought increased understanding of Nd&#233;-US relations to her community:       "Fear-Segal's contributions to the Nd&#233; revitalization and empowerment are       important and noteworthy because they are having a positive impact on the       Nd&#233; community's appreciation for the complexity of our ...history with the       settler nation" [Source 2].
The Nd&#233; have acknowledged the significance of       Fear-Segal's work for their community by posting her book on their web       site: http://www.lipanapachebandoftexas.com/ancestry_005.htm     Crucially, at the same time that Fear-Segal was communicating the issue       of the lost children, the Nd&#233; elders were beginning to petition state and       federal governments for formal recognition of their tribe's status.
To do       this, they had to demonstrate continuity of geographic location and       cultural traditions.
News of the re-discovery of the two Nd&#233; children       (2002), publication of White Man's Club (2007), and the       spirit-releasing ceremony enacted at the children's graves (2009),       provided public evidence of these continuities [Source 3].
In March 2009,       the Nd&#233; were granted State Recognition by Texas.
In August 2012 they       presented their petition for Federal Recognition.
Fear-Segal's work thus       contributed to this broader context of cultural reawakening within the Nd&#233;       community, to the recreation of their cultural capital, and to political       recognition by the state of Texas and, it is anticipated, by the Federal       government.
Their Vice Chairman explained: "Fear- Segal's work provided       some of the vital evidence needed for the Nd&#233; to seek and gain official       recognition" [Source 4].
More broadly, as a paradigm for collaborative       research leading to significant impacts, Nd&#233; scholar Tamez asserts that       Fear-Segal's "work in all its dimensions has established a vital model in       how to conduct research with and alongside indigenous peoples" [Source 2].
In 2010, in response to interest generated by Fear-Segal's work on the       Nd&#233; among other Carlisle descendant communities, Barbara Landis (Indian       School biographer at Cumberland County Historical Society, PA) set up a       Facebook group to facilitate Carlisle descendants' search for ancestors,       sharing of stories, circulation of photographs, and assessment of the       school's legacy.
At July 2013 this group has 547 members: https://www.facebook.com/#!/groups/168544626516258/     Fear-Segal's work has been instrumental in bringing stories, once only       narrated within the Nd&#233; community by oral tradition, to a national and       international audience.
Firstly, press coverage of the Nd&#233; blessing       ceremonies contributed to public understanding of Apache history and       culture, as well as the enduring legacy of the government's programme of       Native American assimilation [Source 3].
Secondly, The Lost Ones       documentary, exploring issues of loss, cultural damage and indigenous       boarding schools, is described by the Nd&#233; Vice Chairman Gonzalez as "an       extraordinary piece of work" [Source 4].
Screenings, in Canada, New       Zealand, Argentina, Czech Republic, UK, US, [Source 5] consistently       provoke "powerful discussions about this history [of boarding schools],       the current conditions of many indigenous peoples living both on and off       reservations, and human rights" [Source 7].. At a California screening,       vociferous audience demand for an event on the site at Carlisle led       Fear-Segal and Susan Rose (the film's director) to organise a public       symposium: Carlisle PA: site of indigenous histories, memories, and         reclamations (October 5-6, 2012) [Source 8].
This brought over 290       delegates to Carlisle, including Pulitzer Prize winner N. Scott Momaday       (Kiowa) and over 150 other Native Americans from 36 tribes.
Events were       covered in the press [Source 9].
An immediate impact of this symposium was the indefinite suspension of a       US Army order to demolish the Indian School Farmhouse, after an intense       roundtable meeting between symposium delegates and Army officials [Source       6].
The farmhouse, which today stands on the campus of the US Army War       College in Carlisle, is the only surviving building where Indian students       lived and worked, and in recognition of the role Fear-Segal's work played       in the preservation of this building, Rose asks, "How many of us can say       our work has led to the U.S. Army deciding to stop a planned demolition?!"
[Source 7].
A further key impact of this symposium was a successful grant application       to fund the digitisation of the Carlisle Indian School records, to create       a comprehensive searchable database of Carlisle Indian Industrial School       resources.
