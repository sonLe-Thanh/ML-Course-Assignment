     Context       Before the SPRINT methodology, local authorities would run change projects       using consultants,       specialised IT methods.
The problems with these methods were that they       were expensive, they       focused on technology development rather than organizational change, and       they reduced the role       of regular staff in the change process.
Pathways to Impact       In 2000 the Director for ICT at Salford City Council approached Kawalek       and Wastell to design a       methodology for change and innovation based on their research insights       that would foster       engagement in change projects.
This led to the creation of SPRINT.
The       methodology was tested       and quickly adopted by Salford City Council and utilised in projects in       Housing, Revenues,       Customer Services and other areas.
These led to awards including       Comprehensive Performance       Assessment (CPA) Scores of 4* (the highest) and Local Government       Association "Best of the Best"       local government services award (for Customer Services Revenues and       Benefits).
The Strategic       Director of Customer and Support Services at Salford City Council comments       [A]: "There was         nothing in the marketplace that met the needs of the council.
It was         necessary to develop a method         that allowed a high degree of participation amongst council staff so         that IT projects could be         managed by business users and IT staff alike.
Hence, SPRINT was         developed and allowed         process models to be built and other kinds of creative engagement to         take place.
The IT function in         Salford City Council valued it because of its user-friendliness but also         because it allowed them to         develop formal IT requirements.
This was seen as a unique offering."
In 2004 the SPRINT approach was adopted as the standard for the whole       local government sector       by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.
In an effort to ensure that       the programme was       universally applied, the SPRINT user group was formed at that time,       consisting to date of over 100       UK councils and other public sector bodies.
Reach and Significance       Having invested &#163;230,000 to date in the development of the SPRINT       programme (including the       training of 240 staff in change and transformation programmes) Salford       City Council was able to       achieve the &#163;20 million pounds savings required of it from 2005/6 to 2011,       following the Gershon       report.
SPRINT was the key change initiative deployed to this end and       focused on staff       engagement in the change process, and was considered vital to maintaining       service quality.
A       Senior Business Consultant [B] confirms "Salford City Council's         requirement to save in excess of         &#163;20m during 2011 was delivered as part of "Think Efficiency" a SPRINT         programme designed as a         response to the Gershon report".
The savings are achieved by process       change identified by the       user community, plus automation achieved through the translation of       process diagrams into system       functionality.
After the major success of SPRINT in the delivery of the council's       transformation programme,       SPRINT continues to be used today.
The Strategic Director of Customer and       Support Services,       confirms [A] that it remains a key methodology in the council and is       deployed in current change       projects in education and housing areas: "There have been a number of         high-profile deployments         of the SPRINT method in areas including Social Services, Housing and         Education.
These projects         continue to this date and a realistic estimate of the value of savings         achieved across the portfolio is         &#163;0.5M"     Later, starting in 2009, Salford City Council commissioned developments       of the SPRINT method in       the form of Figure of Eight methodology and Transform Trios.
These were       developed by Clifford of       Manchester Business School and Kawalek, and will be published in       Clifford's PhD thesis (expected       2013).
They retained the philosophical position established by the earlier       work.
Distinctive new       contributions are (1) a dynamic new model expressing the role of senior       and middle managers in       change programmes and (2) innovation cell methodology based on active       trios.
Two hundred and       forty staff in Salford have been trained in these aspects.
The Strategic       Director at Salford City       Council [A] has written to report that these developments have saved the       council a further       &#163;500,000: "There have been a number of other high-profile deployments         of the SPRINT method in         areas including Social Services, Housing and Education.
These projects         continue to this date and         a realistic estimate of the value of savings achieved across the         portfolio is &#163;0.5m.
Overall, the         value of SPRINT to Salford Council has been gained in terms of         operational savings, increased         know-how and capacity, government awards and reputation.
On the latter,         it was good for the         council to spend a number of years facilitating the national SPRINT         user-group."
The SPRINT methodology has been used to deliver key projects in other       councils.
An example of       this is at Oldham MBC where from 2010 onwards, SPRINT has been utilised in       a Value for Money       (VfM) programme alongside other related change programmes.
The former       Director of Customer       and Business Change at Oldham MBC writes [C]: "SPRINT was used to         enable delivery of the         Value for Money (VFM) Programme and in related change programmes.....         SPRINT is a cleverly         designed method, able to bridge between user experiences and IT         architectures.
At its core it is a         key tool for engagement of staff, managers and customers in transforming         services."
The VfM       strategy at Oldham MBC developed with SPRINT at its core achieved budget       savings of &#163;40M.
In       separate programmes SPRINT was also used to develop business and       transformational change in       key areas of the council such as; Highways, Children's Services, Building       Services, HR and       Finance.
An iteration of SPRINT utilising improved metrics but retaining the core       principles of the       methodology called Innov8 was developed at Leeds City Council.
The method       became the       council's adopted approach to business change and was utilised in a       variety of projects.
It was       used across a range of service reorganisations delivering financial       savings and improved       performance [D].
The SPRINT user group gained membership of 100 agencies [E], the majority       of which were other       local councils.
In addition over 1500 Council staff across the country       have been accredited as       SPRINT Practitioners.
