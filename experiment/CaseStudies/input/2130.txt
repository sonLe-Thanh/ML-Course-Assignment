     Continued impact on appraisal and evaluation in central government       The Newcastle approach continues to form the basis for cost benefit       analysis in the public sector.
This is demonstrated by its inclusion in HM       Treasury's `Green Book' (IMP1).
The Green Book provides guidance       on how to assess the economic consequences of decisions.
It thus provides       the template for policy-making across the full range of government and       public service concerns.
Revisions were made in 2011 and the WTP model       remains a key part of this document.
It states: "A benefit of some         proposals is the prevention of fatalities or injuries.
The appropriate         starting point for valuing these benefits is to measure the individual's         WTP for a reduction in risk of death" (IMP1p61).
Government departments' use of the values of risks to life and health in     their appraisals can be found in a 2008 report to the Inter-departmental     Group on Value of Life and Health.
This includes a number of references to     the use of Newcastle research in policy-making: DEFRA's use of Chilton et       al's research (5) in their assessments; Home Office use of the     Carthy et al.
research (2) to derive values for certain     serious crimes; and the Food Standards Agency's use of the work of Jones-Lee     et al.
on the pure value of living (IMP2p8).
In addition, the     Department of Communities and Local Government's (DCLG) review of building     regulations in 2010 calculated the quality adjusted life year using the     Newcastle model.
It specified that money needs to be provided to ensure the     maintenance of standards in building conversion, as the risk cost ranges     from &#163;45,000-&#163;63,000 (IMP3p6).
Continued impact on transport policy       Transport policy is the area in which governments most explicitly and most       acutely face issues of safety and risk.
Newcastle research continues to       have impact in this area.
The Department for Transport's (DfT) online       resource states that the Transport Analysis Guidance (TAG) "should be         seen as a requirement for all projects/studies that require government         approval.
For projects/studies that do not require government approval,         TAG should serve as a best practice guide".
TAG guidance (IMP4)       refers explicitly to the Chilton et al.
research (1,3).
Newcastle has also been involved in a response to the DfT in relation to       an evaluation of the need to update the calculations of the values of       prevented fatalities and injuries (IMP5).
Following the Chilton et         al.
report (3), the Rail Safety and Standards Board changed       the way it valued the prevention of a fatality in its appraisal of safety       measures (IMP6).
On the basis of the report's recommendations, the       valuation applied to road safety was also applied to rail safety.
This was       supported by further research undertaken by Jones-Lee et al., the       final Taking Safe Decisions programme report being published in 2009 (IMP7).
Extension of impact into new policy domains       The Newcastle team's development of new methods of calculating a WTP-based       measure has allowed the impact of their research to be extended into the       healthcare sector.
In work commissioned by the Scottish Government on the       costs of alcohol misuse, the Newcastle model of calculation is used to       describe the estimation of intangible costs.
The work refers to the QALY       value used by the Home Office in their policies on crime.
This value, says       the report, "is based on a willingness-to-pay estimate to avoid some         specific consequences of a road injury derived from data collected in         1997 (Carthy et al.1999) [(2)]" (IMP8p75-76).
With regard to air pollution, the original research undertaken by Chilton       et al.
for DEFRA (5) has directly informed the UK-wide       strategy's targets for reductions in the concentrations of nine major       pollutants to be achieved between 2010 and 2020 (IMP9).
The       strategy states: "A major step change in the analysis ... is that         health outcomes have now been valued, following recommendations by the         IGCB [Interdepartmental Group on Costs and Benefits].
These         recommendations drew upon recent research in the area, particularly the         Defra-led study by Chilton et al (2004) [(5)] which         aimed to identify the willingness to pay to reduce the health impacts         associated with air pollution, using a survey-style contingent valuation         approach"  (IMP9p164).
The research also features in       DEFRA's 2013 best practice guidance regarding the methodology for       estimating how changes in air pollutants affect health and environmental       outcomes (IMP10).
It states: "Values for a range of health         endpoints have been agreed, following recommendations by the IGCB...The         IGCB recommendations draw upon research in the area of air quality         health impact valuation, particularly the study by Chilton et al (2004)       [(5)].
This study had been commissioned by Defra to provide         empirical evidence on the willingness to pay to reduce the health         impacts associated with air pollution...Following the publication of the         Chilton et al (2004) study [(5)], Defra held a workshop         for expert economists and epidemiologists to discuss the results of this         study" (IMP10p16).
