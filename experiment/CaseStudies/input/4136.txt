     The project has shown how local communities can work together with       professional archaeologists,       universities, the public sector and national bodies to produce and promote       new understandings of       the past.
It demonstrates that such public collaboration can have       far-reaching impacts, on the local       population and beyond.
Recognition of the value of the project is       reflected in the &#163;933,872       awarded to SELT as a consequence (HLF &#163;650,600; The Art Fund &#163;100,000;       Leicestershire       County Council (LCC) &#163;90,200; Museum &amp; Galleries Improvements Fund       &#163;35,000; Museums       Libraries Archives Council/V&amp;A Purchase Grant Fund &#163;35,000;       Renaissance East Midlands       &#163;15,000; The Headley Trust &#163;5,000; Friends of Leicester and Leicestershire       Museums &#163;1,000,       Leicestershire Museums Archaeological Fieldwork Group/HFWG &#163;2,072).
This       funded purchase       and conservation of the finds, development of displays at Harborough and       Hallaton Museums,       creation of two touring exhibitions and web resources, and the organising       of workshops for schools       and community groups plus open public events (E2).
REACH:     The research has had local and regional impact through:            enhancing public understanding of the cultural value of Heritage and         the Historic Environment,         through:                motivation and training of HFWG from `interest group' to           near-professional skill levels,           running their own annual survey and fieldwork programme, and offering           expertise e.g.
in           geophysics to other groups (E3).
HFWG's example and support has encouraged foundation or revitalising           of other local           fieldwork groups now active in the region (e.g.
Kibworth, the Welland           Valley and Melton           Mowbray) (E3).
economic benefits accruing to the local community through visitors to         Hallaton Museum &#8212;         2,649 between 3/5/2009-30/9/2011 (E4)        economic benefits to the regional community through visits to         Harborough Museum - 56,749         (to Sept 2012, the date of the last available LCC census)       underpinning successful campaigns in 2011 to preserve threatened         regional museums (E5)           At national scale:            Involvement of the BM and extensive media coverage has served to         enhance the value of UK         Heritage.
The project has helped to shape the way that major UK hoard sites are         treated, with large-scale         investigation of the kind undertaken at Hallaton now becoming standard,         e.g.
for the         Staffordshire hoard.
Following investigations of the largest-ever hoard of late Roman coins         found in the UK at         Frome (Somerset), which suggested this might be a ritual deposit, the BM         approached the         UoA as their preferred partner in a successful bid to the AHRC for         funding to investigate why         and where third-century AD Roman coin hoards were buried in Britain         (AHRC Grant Ref:         AH/K000438/1, &#163;645,600 awarded 06/02/2013)       HFWG members contributed evidence to the English Heritage survey on         illicit metal-detecting         (2009) currently informing national conservation policies (E6).
Alongside other projects in the current cycle our work at Hallaton         contributed to the award of a         Queen's Anniversary Prize, that explicitly recognised the public impact         generated (E7).
SIGNIFICANCE:     A key contribution has been publicising the benefits of engaging local       communities in the kind of       internationally important project that is normally the preserve of       professional and academic bodies.
It has revitalised the pride and interest of the local and regional       community in their heritage and its       preservation and protection, resulting in a project exhibition in Hallaton       Museum in 2009, funded by       the HLF (who highlighted the impressive nature of community involvement).
Designed by the local       community itself, the display won 'Best Exhibition' and also 'Best Museum'       at the Heritage Awards       for Leicestershire and Rutland (2009) (E7).
The museum attracts       visitors to the village from some       distance who often stay to sample local amenities and look round the area,       bringing vital economic       benefits into the locality.
The BM combined forces with LCC to ensure that the internationally       important finds would stay in       the region rather than be taken to London.
A major HLF grant (noted above)       was secured to       upgrade the Harborough Museum making the project its central exhibition.
In the first six months       after the opening of the updated Museum in 2009 visitor numbers rose by       100% with 10,000       people visiting the exhibition (E8).
Frequent events based around       the project are held at the site,       run by UoA staff and HFWG.
The presence of the treasure exhibition and the       increased visitor       figures have been instrumental in saving the Museum from threatened       closure through a campaign       and petition (January 2011 - 2,354 signatures) supported by TV historian       Michael Wood (E5).
Other local groups have also become involved, the `Market Harborough Movie       Makers' won a 4*       (Silver) award at the 2010 British International Amateur Film Festival       with their documentary `The       Hallaton Treasure' , now a permanent part of the Harborough Museum       displays (E9).
During the refurbishment of Harborough Museum as an integrated library,       adult learning facility and       permanent home for the Hallaton treasure (23/3-3/11/13), the material was       temporarily displayed       at LCC's flagship Snibston Discovery Museum (13,918 visitors 23/3-31/7).
Here it was central to a       major exhibition, `Treasure!
Shedding Light on Leicestershire's Past',       showcasing the project to       new audiences: Snibston has over 100K visitors annually, from       Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire,       Derbyshire, Leicestershire and beyond.
Hallaton also featured in LCC's       contribution to the national       Festival of British Archaeology (13 - 28 July, 2013).
Although to deter clandestine looting the project was initially kept       quiet, since the press release in       2003 events and displays have been undertaken to involve the wider       community and encourage       other local historical and archaeological groups.
This includes several       displays in the village for the       community with talks by experts; 100+ talks by the UoA; 40+ talks by the       HFWG; `hands on' talks       to local schools; displays for National Archaeology Week; involvement in       conferences including the       annual public Hallaton Treasure conference.
A total of 270,680       people have attended South-East       Leicestershire Treasure (SELT) projects from Sept 2009 up to the end of       the programme in Sept       2012 (Hallaton Museum until April 2011): Museum events (5,175 visitors)       Roadshow       events/conferences (7,262); After School groups (170); Off-site education       (704); `Consumed?'
(touring exhibition for Community Archaeology 67,062); On-site talks/tours       (787); Off-site       talks/tours (1,022); Researchers and enquiries (27); Website views of       slideshow (22,363);       Travelling exhibition (101,064); Goldsmith's Hall (4,553); General       Visitors to Harborough Museum       (56,749); Hallaton Museum (2,649); Training Courses (197).
The project       also contributed to the       tourist economy, reflected in figures for Harborough Museum calculated       using the nationally       recognised Scarborough Tourism Economic Assessment Model (STEAM).
From       &#163;0.26m in 2009       the economic impact of tourist visitors had risen to &#163;0.75m by 2012, with       the combined total for       2011-12 reaching &#163;1.34m (E4).
The project has had a huge impact on the members of the HFWG.
The       training and       encouragement given by the UoA has enabled them to expand knowledge of       their local heritage       and provide them with the skills and expert advice to continue their       research and provide an       example for other interested parties (E3).
They in turn have       nurtured and mentored other local       groups in undertaking similar fieldwork (e.g.
other local communities are       now researching the       archaeology of the middle Welland Valley, Leicestershire and are       participating in a new       collaborative project with the UoA on the archaeological landscapes south       of Melton Mowbray).
The HFWG have also been active outside the region, initiating an       expert-community collaboration       that has led to analysis and exhibition of a silver bowl from the site by       the Goldsmith's Company       London between 9/5/2011-15/7/2011 that attracted 4,553 visitors (E4         &amp; E10).
Looking beyond the core region, the HLF grant has enabled the project to       develop `Consumed?'
a       travelling community exhibition for which UoA staff provided the text.
`Consumed?'
can be       borrowed for no charge by community groups/libraries and in 2010 appeared       at the following       libraries: Loughborough (3/2-5/3); Market Harborough (5/3-7/4); Melton       Mowbray (7/4-5/5); Oadby       (5/5-9/6); Wigston (9/6-7/7); Blaby (7/7-9/8).
By the end of Aug 2012       `Consumed?'
had been       viewed by 67,062 visitors.
Finds from Hallaton formed part of the       BM's `Buried Treasure: Finding       our Past' exhibit (37,000 visitors), which went on a national tour       (4 venues, 180,000 visitors).
Part       of the Harborough Museums display includes a travelling exhibition,       featuring many of the       individuals involved, which embarked upon a 5-year tour beginning in       Leicestershire before going       national.
When the SELT programme ended this had attracted 101,064       visitors at 13 venues       including Ashby (544 children /1,088 adults, Nottingham (2,831/5,661),       Kettering (1,120/2,240) &amp;       Lincoln (3,525/8,613) (E4).
