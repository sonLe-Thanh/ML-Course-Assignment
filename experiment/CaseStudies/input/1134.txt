     Historically, there has been little significant research or service       provision targeted at minority ethnic or other vulnerable groups while       smaller early projects have been forgotten or were never formally written       up to be included in the social policy evidence base.
In the aftermath of       inquiries into health inequalities (notably Acheson and Marmot) and       Equalities legislation, and following significant lobbying, there has been       pressure to address these issues and eye health has now been recognised as       a significant public health issue following new QOF public health       guidelines in 2012.
The national sight loss charity Pocklington Trust commissioned and       published a `Good Practice Guide' (Joule &amp; Levenson 2008), which       states explicitly that: "This good practice guide builds on an action       research project and literature review by the Mary Seacole Centre, De       Montfort University, and on developmental work and research in a range of       national and local organisations.
It is designed to provide information on       issues facing people from black and minority ethnic (BME) communities with       sight loss who would benefit from vision services, as well as suggest       ideas to improve BME access to vision services."
[Joule &amp; Levenson       2008].
This is the only such guidance extant in Europe and is thus widely       used and cited, as described in section 5.
The findings of Johnson et al's research (which highlighted       exclusion/inequality of access for minority groups and worse outcomes)       also fed into a major (&#163;6million+) investment programme by RNIB in       `community engagement projects' to address inequalities in eye health/care       across the UK.
As a part of this programme, The Mary Seacole Research       Centre were commissioned to undertake the evidence review that underpins       this investment, now published by RNIB as RNIB report number CEP/01, 2011       (see section 5 for more information).
As a consequence of his research, Johnson was also asked to contribute to       development of a training resource on `ethnicity and optometry' for the       General Optical Council's CPD agency DOCET in 2011.
The DOCET training       (CPD) resource has had wide distribution.
The General Optical Council has       distributed approximately 11,000 copies of the DOCET `Optometry and       Ethnicity' DVD to optometrists throughout the UK.
Over 300 optometrists       have submitted responses to the multiple choice questions on this       programme to gain CET points.
DOCET note that they expect this to       increase.
The programme is now also available online to UK registered       optometrists, and they are in the process of developing the web site to       incorporate more mechanisms for direct feedback on specific topics.
Finally, Johnson was invited to join the national strategy development       group (Vision2020 UK) to advise on equality and (ethnic) diversity issues       in the preparation of the national policy guidance (www.vision2020uk.org.uk)       &#8212; leading to the national eye health strategy.
Vision 2020 UK also       supports the international initiative of the same name.
Johnson has also       been asked to join the new Low Vision policy subgroup looking at BME and       equality issues to inform national policy in 2013.
The following dissemination activities all contributed to the impact         of this research:            Invited Presentation (MRDJ), UK Department of Health's Eye Care         Strategy Group (May 2010)       Prof Johnson delivered a workshop at the Vision2020 Annual Conference         at QE Conference Centre London 16 June 2011 http://www.vision2020uk.org.uk/UKVisionstrategy/        June 2011 MJ was interviewed by RNIB Radio and TV for the         sight-impaired following presentations at Vision2020 Conference on         ethnicity and sight loss.
