     Professor Broome's work has attracted a good deal of attention among       individuals and organisations already concerned with climate change, as       well as bringing others to a fresh concern with it.
His work has also been       used to shape policy.
(i) Work for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change       Most notably, Professor Broome was invited to serve as Lead Author for       Working Group III of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental       Panel on Climate Change, the leading international body for the assessment       of climate change.
This invitation came in 2010 from Ottmar Edenhofer, the       Chairman of Working Group III, who was familiar with some of Professor       Broome's work on climate change.
(Professor Broome was told informally       that the subsequent invitation to become a member of the IPCC's Synthesis       Report, where he serves as the only philosopher - an invitation that       likewise came from Ottmar Edenhofer - was driven by a conviction that the       scientific issues of climate change are now less pressing than the ethical       issues.)
The report is intended for policy-makers, and it will include the       application of theory taken from Professor Broome's book Weighing         Lives.
Professor Broome's first involvement with this report was to       take part in a preliminary meeting of authors for Working Groups II and       III, where he was on the scientific steering committee and chaired two       sessions: this meeting was designed `to support ongoing AR5 [Fifth       Assessment Report] efforts and promote coordination across AR5 author       teams..., [by summarising] the body of knowledge and [highlighting] key       issues related to this important set of topics [i.e.
topics concerning       climate change].
'[i] An early draft of the report       appeared in the late spring of 2013 and received extensive comments from       government officials.
Professor Broome's research assistant Dr Levy, who       provides commentary on material drafted by Professor Broome for the IPCC,       has himself now been invited to act as an expert reviewer of other IPCC       reports.
(ii) Raising Awareness of the Issues       In 2012, Professor Broome spoke at a public policy conference in Austria,       organised by Joanneum Research, a research institute involved in public       policy research owned by the Austrian state of Styria.
This was attended       both by members of the public and by public policy makers.
Professor       Broome has also given many lectures beyond academia about climate change.
One of these was to the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences in 2008 (and was       attended by the King and Crown Princess).
In 2009, he gave a talk on       Ethics and Public Policy, by video link, to a large conference in       Wellington that consisted mostly of public policy makers, but also       included a large number of civil servants.
He also gave a talk to the       University of Toronto, after which finance columnist Ellen Roseman wrote       in The Star, a Canadian newspaper, `My head was exploding after       Professor Broome's lecture.
And I realized why I was attracted to       philosophy - because of the fundamental questions it tries to address and       the reasoned debate it encourages.
'[ii] He gave a Tanner       Lecture on the topic, open to members of the public, at the University of       Michigan in 2012.
Later in 2012 Professor Broome gave talks at the UK       Treasury and the World Bank.
For the former he used feedback forms, and       Fayyaz Muneer, organiser of the talk, commented, `I now know to       distinguish between good solutions and just solutions...
I will also think       more carefully about what we owe to future generations...
I'll be arguing       with people differently now.
'[1] Other comments, all       from employees of the Treasury, included the following: `The talk offered       a new method of dealing with climate change... [This] will influence my       future work and economic thinking.'
`To my surprise the conclusion it drew       is simple, justifiable in principle, and provides a very interesting new       perspective on the political economy of tackling climate change... [It's]       affected my thinking on issues relevant to my job...' `It changed my       perception of plausible and desirable responses to climate change.'
Several other respondents referred to the new perspective that Professor       Broome had provided.
Towards the end of 2012, he gave a talk in Oslo       organised by the Oxford University Norway Society and attended by the UK       Ambassador to Norway, Jane Owen.
In a subsequent e-mail to him, she wrote,       `Your presentation on climate change and the drivers related to       beneficence and justice was extremely thought-provoking.'
She went on to       applaud what she described as `the positive impact [of your international       work] on experts arguing to push climate back up the political and       intellectual agenda.
'[2]     (iii) Discussions on Blogs and Elsewhere       Professor Broome's work has been much discussed on blogs.
His Scientific         American article and his work for the Stern Review are both cited in       a report on the website of `Economics for Equity and the Environment       Network' (`E3 Network'), a national network which aims to assist       democratic and participatory decision-making in public policies to protect       people and the environment.
[iii] A post from the       American organisation `Climate Science Watch', a non-profit public       interest education and advocacy project, mentions and commends Professor       Broome's Scientific American article.
[iv] There       are posts on the same article in blogs entitled `Unchartered Territory'[v],       `Real Climate'[vi], `Energy Bulletin'[vii]       (published by the think tank `Post Carbon Institute'), and `The       Uncertainty Principle'[viii].
There are summaries of       Professor Broome's ideas on the websites for both the National Center for       Policy Analysis[ix], a non-profit non-partisan public       policy research organisation, and Leonardo Energy: Global Community for       Sustainable Energy Professionals[x].
Three documents       from the `Global Commons Institute', an independent organisation       campaigning on climate change, cite Professor Broome's work.
[xi]     (iv) The Stern Review     Finally, the Stern review, on which Professor Broome's work has had an       influence (see &#167;2 above), has itself been very influential.
It is cited in       several national government policy statements.
For instance, the UK       Treasury wrote in its 2008 `action plan' on sustainable development that       `the Treasury will continue to propagate the findings of the Stern review       internationally and to use it as a basis for domestic actions to reduce       greenhouse gas emissions'[xii], and in its 2010 report       `Climate Plan', it adopts the review's main aims [xiii].
The Australian government, in its 2011 `Climate Change Plan', advocates       taking action to combat climate change with an extensive quotation from       the Stern review that concludes: `Tackling climate change is the       pro-growth strategy for the longer term, and it can be done in a way that       does not cap the aspirations for growth of rich or poor countries.
The       earlier effective action is taken, the less costly it will be.
'[xiv]       Finally, the Swedish government's 2009 `Overview of Swedish Climate and       Energy Policy'[xv], the German Federal Environment       Agency's 2009 `Concept for a Future Climate Policy'[xvi],       the French government's 2011 `Plan of Adaptation to Climate Change'[xvii],       and a 2009 EU Commission White Paper[xviii] all make       frequent references to the review and cite its estimates of how much       costlier inaction will be than action.
