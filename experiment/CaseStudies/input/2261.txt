     Professional guidance on infection control procedures, including       instrument decontamination, has evolved over the years in response to       emerging challenges.
HIV prompted major changes that resulted in adoption       of standard precautions, and the more recent emergence of the prion       disease vCJD forced a re-assessment of instrument decontamination       processes across health care.
University of Glasgow research provided evidence of sub-standard       compliance with existing instrument decontamination guidance in a high       proportion of general dental practices in Scotland, and identified       instrument decontamination procedures that required updated guidance to       ensure patient safety from prions and other infectious agents,       particularly blood-borne viruses.
Profs Andrew Smith and Jeremy Bagg       provided these findings in a report to the Scottish Executive Health       Department (SEHD) that was published by the Glennie Group in November       2004.a Immediately, instrument decontamination in the 837       general dental practices across Scotland became a priority issue for the       Scottish Executive, and resulted in a large-scale coordinated response       across Health Protection Scotland, NHS Education for Scotland (NES),       Healthcare Facilities Scotland, National Procurement and NHS Boards.
The result was significant government funding to upgrade dental practice       decontamination facilities and to provide additional training for dental       personnel in Scotland.
Full compliance with the `Glennie requirements'       (see below) has been mandatory in Scotland since December 2012, ensuring       that general dental practices have implemented decontamination processes       that are validated and significantly more robust, consistent and       evidence-driven than previously.
This initiative, driven by the research       undertaken at Glasgow Dental School, has led to a reduced risk of       cross-infection for the four million patients receiving dental treatment       every year in Scotland and a greater number elsewhere in the UK.
The key requirements for Glennie compliance, identified by the Glasgow       research, included the need for a local decontamination unit (LDU) that       was physically separated from the clinical treatment area; enhanced       instrument cleaning procedures with a strong recommendation for       installation of automated washer disinfectors; all decontamination       equipment to be installed, validated and maintained by an accredited test       engineer, with the recommended routines of daily and weekly testing       undertaken by fully trained staff; and for the implementation of a       documented decontamination process, a quality management system and       documented staff training.
In 2008, the Scottish Health Planning Note       (SHPN) 13, Part 2 was published, setting out the technical requirements       for establishment of LDUs with which dental practices must legally comply.
Implementing decontamination training     Following their 2004 report, the Glasgow team remained involved in the       development of guidance to help general dental practitioners comply with       the updated decontamination requirements.
Part of this role was delivered       through involvement with the Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness       Programme (SDCEP), a government-backed initiative (managed through NES),       to develop user-friendly, evidence-based guidance for the dental       profession in Scotland.
As part of SDCEP, Bagg participated in the group       of expert practitioners that developed the 'Decontamination into Practice'       guidance documentsb (`Cleaning of dental instruments', 2007;       `Sterilization of dental instruments', 2011).
A new section of the SDCEP       `Practice Support Manual entitled `Health and Safety &#8212; Infection Control)       was launched in December 2012), which provides detailed guidance on the       management procedures necessary for effective infection control in dental       practice.c     The SDCEP documents now form core elements of an on-going training and       support service delivered to Scottish dental practice staff by a NES       decontamination training team, established by the Chief Dental Officer and       the NES Dean for Postgraduate Dental Education in collaboration with Bagg       in 2005.
Building on the effective visitation model used in the Glasgow       research, the team is led by a highly experienced dental practitioner with       specific infection control skills and comprises an infection-control nurse       and a group of highly trained specialist dental nurses.
The teams visit       practices to evaluate their existing decontamination and infection control       processes, working in partnership with the practice staff, and later       revisit the practice to assess the implementation of any changes.
Since       2008, this in-practice training and support has been delivered to 7,893       dental care professionals (including 3,811 dentists)d, at a       total cost to NES of approximately &#163;2.2 million.e     Capital investment in improved decontamination infrastructure in           Scotland     Widespread Glennie compliance has required a significant financial       commitment from both dental practices and the Scottish Executive via the       territorial NHS boards.
In total, the boards have invested &#163;16.8 million       in capital funding towards LDUs and practice improvements (including       physical alterations) targeted to decontamination between 1st January 2008       &#8212; 31st July 2013.f The Scottish Executive provisions to support       this investment included:             February 2008 &#8212; The Scottish Executive and NHS National         Procurements began a national contract (MEK005, 2008 to 2009 and NP143,         2010 to 2013) to provide cost-effective purchase, installation and         maintenance of validated and compliant washer-disinfectors (WDs), which         were recommended within SHPN 13 Part 2 as the most effective means of         instrument cleaning.g,k         March 2008 &#8212; Funding was subsequently made available by the         Scottish Executive as part of an on-going Scottish Executive Primary and         Community Care Premises Modernisation Programme with a total of &#163;75         million allocated between 2008 and 2011 to dental services, training and         decontamination.h         September 2008 &#8212; &#163;5 million provided towards further         improvements specifically aimed at decontamination between 2008 and         2009.i        In October 2012, an additional &#163;2 million in funding was made         available to support purchase of WDs.j           In 2009, a survey indicated that whilst many dental practices had been       able to establish an LDU, 17% of them would struggle to be       Glennie-compliant without moving premises or building extensions.
The       original deadline of December 2009 was subsequently changed to December       2012 for practices that could develop a feasible action plan.k       The Scottish Chief Dental Officer, who described administering the       adoption of dental decontamination reforms as having been one of the more       challenging aspects of her role, commented in the Scottish         Dental Magazine that, "it would be nice to think that         decontamination has helped a few practices and given them the         opportunity to move into better accommodation".l     Broader influence on decontamination UK-wide     The reach of the University of Glasgow research extends beyond Scotland,       where it has directly influenced the guidance documents of other UK health       administrations.
In October 2008, the Chief Dental Officer (England)       issued the `Decontamination Health Technical Memorandum 01-05:       Decontamination in primary care dental practices' (HTM 01-05), which       included information already released in Scotland through the SDCEP and       SHPN 13 Part 2, and acknowledged the 2004 Scottish dental survey report as       highlighting the issue of decontamination standards (`The need for       guidance', p.8, section 1.7).m These guidelines were released       along with a local self-assessment audit tool, the data from which       identified decontamination issues comparable to those reported previously       by the Glasgow group in Scotland.
HTM 01-05 was subsequently adopted in       Northern Ireland in November 2009 and Wales in March 2011.
Unlike Scotland, there was no central funding in England or Wales to make       provisions to meet the HTM 01-05 requirements of decontamination, instead       opting for a more gradual path towards full compliance.
Funding was       provided by Primary Care Trusts, for example, in NHS East Sussex Downs       &amp; Weald and NHS Hastings &amp; Rother grants of &#163;874,000 and &#163;574,000,       respectively, were awarded between 2008-2010 towards the purchase of WDs       and structural changes to practice buildings.n In NHS       Shropshire grants totalling &#163;100,000 were issued to 13 practices in       2010-2011 for the purchase of decontamination equipment.o By       April 2010, all general dental practices in England were expected to have       become compliant with essential requirements (have a validated       decontamination process) and to have registered with the Care and Quality       Commission, who are responsible for ensuring compliance with HTM 01-05.
No       timescale was set for achieving best practice (including a separate room       for LDU and WDs).
