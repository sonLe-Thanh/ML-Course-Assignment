            In order for the above research to achieve maximum impact, key         findings, ideas and recommendations were `road-tested' via a range of         potential beneficiaries and stakeholders, such as the British Youth         Council, the Prince's Trust, the Hansard Society and the UK Youth         Parliament, to formulate how practical and workable policies could be         developed to reflect the thrust of the research.
These stakeholders thus         met with Tonge to discuss the research and prospective policy         outworking.
These groups were also involved in dissemination of the         research into the public domain, mainly via websites and forums (e.g.
the Hansard Society ran a `Heads Up' interactive discussion blog in         2009-10, to which Tonge regularly contributed) and helped promote some         of the findings to influence adoption by the government.
Other processes         of dissemination included promotion and discussion of the research and         outworking at public events, ranging from ESRC Festivals of Social         Science (2008, Sheffield, 2012 Birmingham); via the chairing of local         youth councils, e.g.
Bridgend's in 2009); and via television and radio         programmes (e.g.
`Tell it Like it Is' and `Dragon's Eye' on BBC Wales,         2009, with the research findings also featured on BBC Radio 4's         Westminster Hour in 2013).
Research findings have been presented directly to government         ministers; Tonge was invited to present research and recommendations to         the Prime Minister, the Cabinet Office and to the government's         Democratic Renewal Council of senior ministers.
Research findings on the         value of citizenship education were sent directly to the Education         Minister, Michael Gove, in 2012 and the government reversed its initial         intention to abolish citizenship education from the school curriculum.
Tonge also presented his research to Dail Eireann (the Irish Parliament)         and at the National Assembly for Wales.
Young people responded to the         research in a series of interactive discussions with Tonge in the         Hansard Society's Heads Up Forum.
The research has had the following impacts, benefitting stakeholders and       young people, evidenced in the written testimonials provided from         government ministers which show how recommendations arising from the       research have been put directly into effect.
A dedicated Minister for Youth Citizens and Youth Engagement was       established in October 2010 to bolster youth civil and civic engagement       and to coordinate youth engagement initiatives, which the research       highlighted as hitherto too piecemeal and uncoordinated.
A youth online hub was created by the government in 2010,       allowing young people to access information concerning citizenship       opportunities and funding for youth engagement projects and informational       networks, such as the Ministry of Justice's Youth Network programme.
The Children Schools and Families Bill 2011 placed statutory         responsibilities upon schools to give pupils `voice', in line with       research recommendations.
The research highlighted that young people were knowledge-deficient in       terms of how to interact with local authorities.
Consequently, the       government placed a statutory duty upon local authorities to consider         permanent arrangements for consultations with local populations on       the delivery of services, reflective of all ages, to include       permanent advisory and scrutiny panels.
The research made a very clear case for the retention of citizenship         education and for improvements in the consistency and effectiveness       of its delivery.
It demonstrated the gains evident in terms of civic       engagement, literacy and knowledge of how decisions are made at local and       national levels from citizenship classes.
Significantly, the         Conservatives moved from a position of opposition to citizenship         education prior to taking office in 2010 to one of retention as the       subject was clearly shown to be of considerable value in bolstering       citizen engagement, as shown in the Citizenship         Foundation report February 2013.
The research did not advocate a lowering of the voting age for       Westminster elections and the current government has cited its evidence in       this respect (Hansard         col 523, 24/01/13).
It argued that there was no case in this respect       and that public opinion could not act as a clear guide, as the research       demonstrated that those aged 18+ strongly opposed change whilst those       younger were (marginally) in favour of change.
The research highlighted       the considerable variation in terms of ages of responsibility.
It did       suggest that the age of franchise in devolved nations could be determined       by the governments of those nations, a feature accepted by the SNP (which       commented on the research) in government.
The research suggested that       ensuring that young people are registered to vote is a bigger       priority than examination of the voting age and government/Electoral       Commission advertising campaigns have reflected this.
A pilot programme of civic service, National Citizen Service, has been       introduced, on a voluntary basis.
The research, whilst supportive of the       idea in principle based upon existing national and international       comparative evidence (USA and Germany), highlighted the difficulties of       introducing compulsory schemes (cost issues), privately-run programmes       (motive issues) and also stressed the need for clear definition of the       purpose of such schemes.
Volunteering opportunities have been expanded       under the previous and current governments and the expectation is that       citizen service, if pilots are successful, will be expanded.
Overall, the significance of the research has been to shift governmental       agendas towards a much clearer and far more focused approach towards youth       civil and civic engagement.
Prior to the research, there were fewer       opportunities for volunteering and no national programme, no statutory       engagement with young people at local level, no dedicated minister for       young people, and a focus on voting age, rather than young voter       registration and engagement with the political process.
All of this has       changed, whilst citizenship education has been retained, as the research       advised.
