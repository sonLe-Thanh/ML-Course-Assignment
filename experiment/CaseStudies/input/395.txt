     Following the global economic crisis of 2007, there has been a particular       focus both in the UK and Europe on how macroeconomic policies can be used       to stimulate economic recovery.
A separate, though closely related and       interdependent issue faced by the international community is that of the       euro-crisis.
In this context, JHIAM's research provides not only an       evidence-base for policy makers and the business and financial         community, but a knowledge-base for society, which is       ultimately bound by decisions made by the government.
Impact on public policy     The macroeconomic policy issues that align with JHIAM's research and have       been the focus of debate since 2008 include: the budget deficit; the       crisis in the euro-zone and the UK decision to stay out; monetary policy,       including taxation and the inflation target; and growth and employment and       the implications for these of EU membership.
In all these areas of       macroeconomic policy JHIAM researchers have contributed to policy debate,       both directly, by giving evidence and acting in an advisory       capacity to various government committees, and indirectly, through       intermediaries and by providing an evidence-base for politicians to base       their arguments on.
A key example concerns the UK's role in Europe which       has dominated politics since the Coalition government came to power,       forcing policy makers to consider the economic impacts of EU membership.
The direct contribution of JHIAM researchers to policy debates       include Minford's appearance in front of both the House of Lords EU       Sub-Committee A on Economic and Social Affairs as part of the `Euro Area       Crisis: Follow-up Inquiry' (3 July 2012)5.1 and the House of       Commons Foreign Affairs Committee at an inquiry into `The         Future of the EU: UK Government Policy' (11 September 2012), where       he was introduced by the Chair of the committee as "one of the most         prominent economists advocating British withdrawal from the EU"5.2;       Minford went on to make direct reference to findings published in 3.5 and       3.6.
For example, he referred to the "considerable costs [of] being         inside the European Union" as a result of its "protectionist"       nature and specifically to the "3% of GDP" that would be gained by       "moving to free trade"; this led Members to question Minford       further on the process and consequences of the UK exiting the EU5.2.
In the case of the House of Commons inquiry, the route to influence is       visible through the scrutiny of on-going correspondence between Lord       Boswell (Chair of the Committee) and the Financial Secretary (HM       Treasury).
A letter dated 24 July 2012, composed by Lord Boswell, includes       direct reference to Minford's evidence which Boswell uses in support of       questions he poses to the Financial Secretary, for example, relating to       the "Compact for Growth and Jobs" and the importance of public opinion in       the euro-crisis5.3.
Both these questions were subsequently       addressed by Rt Hon Greg Clark MP (the Financial Secretary at the time) in       the government's response, issued on 3 October 20125.3.
JHIAM research also enters the political arena indirectly through       its use by backbench MPs.
According to a senior politician5.4,       Minford's team's "comprehensive economic analysis of UK macroeconomic         issues in an EU setting provides MPs, in particular those within groups         such as `Fresh Start' and `Better Off Out' with valuable material to         support their arguments."
Members of the `Better Off Out' campaign       are keen to highlight research on the cost of EU membership.
An article in       The Commentator in which the group's Director, Rory Broomfield, states "This         burden of regulation ... is said to be 5 percent of UK GDP per year ...
Similar estimations have been made by ....
Professor Patrick Minford       CBE" (`A           referendum is only the start: We must plan for the finish', 15       May 2013), demonstrates the use of Minford's research in supporting their       argument.
JHIAM researchers also interact regularly with intermediaries in       order to achieve indirect impact on policy and practice.
A number of       policy think-tanks benefit from JHIAM's research via publications and       seminars, including the Adam Smith Institute, The Taxpayers Alliance,       Reform, Open Europe and the Centre for Policy Studies.
JHIAM's strongest       relationship is with the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) whose       mission is to communicate ideas about the workings of the market economy.
The IEA claimed to reach an estimated 750 million people in 2012,       influencing government through input to select committees and       consultations, and the wider public through extensive media coverage.
Several members of the JHIAM research team have contributed written       material to the think-tank.
For example, Minford has recently contributed       to two IEA books.
In the first, `Sharper           Axes, Lower Taxes' (2011), a book which had a print run of       2,600 and has been downloaded over 4,590 times, Minford co-authored a       chapter in which he explained the results of his taxation modelling.
This       book received endorsements from several MPs and others, including the       following comment from Lord Lamont: `I particularly enjoyed the chapter         by Patrick Minford and Jiang Wang, which persuasively queries the idea         that "state investment" contributes to higher economic growth'       (published on IEA website)5.5.
In the second, `The           Euro - the Beginning, the Middle ... and the End?'
(2013), he wrote a chapter which drew heavily on JHIAM's research into the       cost of the UK's membership of the EU, and concluded that "the         institutional evolution being triggered by the euro crisis threatens to         make the [substantial net economic costs on the UK] higher still ..."       This report had a print run of 2,300 copies, has been downloaded over       1,724 times and was featured on Sky News, BBC 5 Live, BBC Radio 4, BBC       Radio 2 and in a comment in The Daily Telegraph (`Europe's           leaders would do well to listen to some constructive criticism',       11 April 2013).
An earlier publication by Minford, `Should         Britain join the euro?'
(2002), also continues to be of value with       over 400 downloads taking place from January to June 2013.
[5.6]     Another key element of JHIAM researchers' strategy to achieve wider         influence is through membership of the IEA sponsored Shadow         Monetary Policy Committee (SMPC).
The SMPC was founded in 1997 as a       forum of independent monetary economists to debate monetary policies of       the newly independent Bank of England.
Minford (co-founder) and Matthews       have been members since its inception.
Prof. Akos Valentinyi and Wickens,       both members of JHIAM, also belong to the SMPC alongside well-known City       economists Peter Warburton, David B. Smith, John Greenwood (Invesco) and       Trevor Williams (Lloyds TSB).
The SMPC's monthly output (a freely       available report on the monetary situation drawing on the research of its       members) is widely cited in the media and followed by the Bank of England       Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).
[5.6]     Through pathways such as these, JHIAM's research has influenced and       continues to influence policy decisions.
Recent policy changes       that are consistent with JHIAM's research include the Prime Minister's       veto of any Treaty change at the EU summit in December 2011 and most       recently his speech on EU renegotiation and an in/out referendum on 23       January 2013.
The latter policy change was likely driven at least partly       by pressure from backbenchers, with an article (`Better           off out?
', 17 January 2013) published by the think tank, The       Centre for Policy Studies, in the run up to the announcement stating that       "the great majority of the Conservative party is clear that       [Britain's relationship with the EU] should change ..."; the same       article credits Minford as one of the principal sources of ideas relating       to the consequences of EU withdrawal.
Impact on the business and financial community     Researchers at JHIAM are committed to engaging politicians on issues       critical to the business community in the UK.
For example, in 2011,       Minford played a lead role in a media campaign in respect of a letter,       published in the Financial Times on 7 September, which warned that the 50       pence tax rate was "doing lasting damage to the UK economy" due to       the unfavourable economic environment for business which it created.
The       letter was signed by 20 UK economists, including representatives from       eight universities and two former MPC members.
The publishing of this plea       not only led the Treasury to respond with a public statement in which it       stated that the Chancellor had "asked HMRC to conduct an analysis of         the revenue raised by the rate", but also captured the attention of       the media, with Minford invited to contribute to a debate       on the issue hosted by Radio 5 Live.
The support from academics on this       issue enabled business leaders to launch similar campaigns of their own,       with subsequent letters along similar lines being published in The       Telegraph in November 2011 and February 2012.
This debate culminated in       the top 50 pence tax rate being cut in the 2012 Budget.
Impact on society     The contribution of JHIAM's research to policy makers and the financial       sector is complemented by its cultural value and input to wider public       debate around economic policy5.7-5.10.
Minford is a regular       contributor to BBC Radio 4 current affairs programmes, notably Today, on       which, in the context of his research, he has provided insights into       topics such as inflation targeting (Is           the BoE wrong on inflation?, 18 October 2011), exchange rate       and finance (Are           financial markets rational?
20 March 2010).
Minford was also       invited to contribute to the Radio 4 series Stephanomics       (31 July 2012) in an episode which looked at whether growth should be a       major target of government policy5.7.
