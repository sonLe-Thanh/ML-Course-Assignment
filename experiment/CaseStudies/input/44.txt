     By challenging conventional wisdom on the health legacy of sporting       mega-events, Pappous's findings have stimulated and informed public debate       in the UK and abroad.
His research has also had demonstrable impact on key       policy makers like the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the House       of Commons and the House of Lords, the Nigerian Minister of Sports, and       the Vice Director of the Colombian Department for Sport, Physical Activity       and Leisure (COLDEPORTES).
Stimulating and informing public debate in the UK and abroad     Pappous's research enabled the British Medical Journal to challenge the       conventional wisdom that sporting mega-events automatically lead to health       benefits for the host population via a supposed increase in grassroots       participation in sports and physical activity.
In fact, Pappous's research       was one of the key studies reviewed by the Guardian health correspondent       Denis Campbell in his Feature Article "Will         London's Olympic public health legacy turn to dust?"
published in       the BMJ the 21st of June 2012 and republished as an Editorial       in the July 2013 issue of the British Journal of Sports Medicine (see       sources to corroborate impact).
The primary aim of this article was to       stimulate public debate by assessing the likelihood of success for the       promise made by the British government and London 2012 organizers to       increase young people's participation in sport.
Pappous's research was       reviewed in the article to directly challenge this promise and to suggest       that, if a broader strategy promoting an active lifestyle is not       implemented, then sporting excitement on its own will not sustain       participation (page 2).
To maximise its impact, Pappous has been proactive in working with the       media and presenting its findings to sport managers and policy makers       worldwide (see our approach to impact in REF3a).
He draws from his       research when he appeared in documentary produced by the BMJ entitled "The         health legacy of the Olympic Games".
In this documentary Pappous       informs the public debate on the health legacy of the Olympic Games by       discussing his research on the 2004 Olympic Games, the failure to       effectively use Olympic facilities for grassroots sport activities in       Greece, and the successes of Scandinavian countries in promoting sports       and physical activity despite not hosting the Summer Olympic Games.
In addition to the BMJ article and documentary, Pappous was invited to       inform public debate on the health legacy of the Olympic Games by       discussing his research on the 2004 Olympic Games in a variety of national       and international media including the BBC ("London         2012 legacy may be short-lived, research claims" 1/6/2011), The         Guardian ("London         2012 sports legacy unlikely to be long-term, research suggests"       29/5/2011) and a Special Article by Traci Watson for USA Today ("Good         will, but not good health" 21/6/2012), the newspaper with the       highest circulation in the United States (six         million readers daily).
Pappous's research has had impact in Africa and Latin America.
In fact,     during the REF 2014 period, he attended as an Invited Speaker three meetings     of sport managers and policy makers where he informed and stimulated their     debate by presenting and discussing his findings on the 2004 Olympic Games     in Greece:     1) 18th National Sports         Festival "Eko 2012": Pappous A "The Sport Legacies of the Olympic       Games: Lessons from Athens 2004 and London 2012" 22 November 2012, Lagos,       Nigeria.

The case of Athens 2004" 28-30       March 2011, Monterrey, Mexico.
3)         III Congreso de la Asociaci&#243;n Latinoamericana de Gerencia Deportiva         (ALGEDE):       Pappous A "Health Benefits of Hosting Sport Mega Events" 25-27 April 2013,       Pereira, Colombia.
Dr Sakis Pappous also informed and stimulated debate by presenting and       discussing his research on the 2004 Olympic Games in Greece to a European         audience of sport organisations' elected representatives and managerial         staff at the second edition of MESGO, the Executive Master in       European Sport Governance (17-21 June 2013.
Barcelona, Spain).
MESGO is a       unique programme designed for sports sector professionals wishing to       master the complex dimensions and the diversity of international practices       related to professional sport on an international level.
Informing and influencing policy makers in the UK and abroad     UNITED KINGDOM       Pappous's findings have informed government's understanding of the       long-term legacy of the Olympic Games, generating a debate with a         spokesman of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.
As the BMJ         article reports at page 2:     Pappous's findings are a direct challenge to Coe's Singapore         certainty.
When a Department for Culture, Media, and Sport spokesman         responded to them, he insisted that ministers and London 2012 organisers         remained "completely committed to delivering a lasting sporting legacy         from the 2012 Games."
But, he added with notable realism:           "Increasing participation as a result of hosting the Games is not an           easy task and past host cities have not managed to achieve that, but           we are not shirking from our ambition."
During the immediate build-up to the London 2012 Olympic Games, Dr       Pappous was invited to write an article for The         House Magazine (the weekly publication of the House of Commons and       the House of Lords) for a special pre-Olympic edition on the potential       legacy of London 2012.
The House Magazine wanted to provide Members of         Parliament and Peers with information about the legacy of the Athens       2004 Olympic Games in order to inform their debate on the potential legacy       of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
The article entitled "Lessons         from abroad: Hosting the Olympics does not necessarily lead to increased         grass roots sports participation" was published in the 19th       of July 2012 issue of The House Magazine (see sources to corroborate       impact).
NIGERIA       Dr Pappous was invited to deliver a keynote talk in the context of the       18th National Sports Festival "Eko 2012" in Nigeria on the 22nd       of November 2012.
This one-day event brought together international sports       administrators from different African nations including the Chief       Executive Officer of the 2010 South Africa FIFA World Cup, Danny Jordaan,       the Director of the Department of International Cooperation and       Development, International Olympic Committee (IOC), Ganda Sithole, and the       Minister of Sports/Chairman of National Sports Commission (NSC) of       Nigeria, Bolaji Abdullahi.
The Nigerian Minister of Sports stated that, after listening to Dr       Pappous talk, he is "now thinking to establish additional and specific       programs to improve the legacy of the National Sports Festival event in       Nigeria" (see sources to corroborate impact).
COLOMBIA       In April 2013 Dr Pappous was invited to Colombia to present and discuss       the results of his study in a sport managers meeting attended by the       Vice-Director of COLDEPORTES Juan Carlos Penia Quintero.
COLDEPORTES       (Departamento Administrativo del Deporte, la Recreacion la Actividad       Fisica y el Aprovechamiento del Tiempo Libre) is the Colombian equivalent       of the Department for Culture, Media, and Sport in the UK.
The Vice-Director of COLDEPORTES addressed a letter to Dr Pappous       stating that his talk on the legacy of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games "has       had an important impact and is currently informing and inspiring our       policies on the design of future Sports Events" (see sources to       corroborate impact).
He added that "Dr Pappous research challenged the       assumptions and the high expectations when setting national targets of       sport participation legacies after a big event.
In the discussions that we       had with him after his second invitation to participate in a Forum in       Colombia, we realised that behaviour change requires funding and support       of different grass root physical activity programs such as the one we are       organising weekly in the streets of Bogota called Ciclovia."
He concluded       that "COLDEPORTES is interested at strengthening the links with       international academic institutions and we are exploring ways to formalize       our collaboration with Dr. Pappous by offering a role as an advisor in the       planning of Mega Events such as the Ciclovia".
