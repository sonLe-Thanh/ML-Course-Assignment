     [numbers] = research outputs listed in Section 3 or       corroboration sources listed in Section 5.     a) Business and jobs: Since 2008, Geospatial       Research Ltd (GRL) has created 12 new highly skilled jobs for graduate and       post PhD-level geoscientists.
The company has a total income to date in       excess of &#163;1.3 million and has provided consultancy services based on SGRG       research [1, 2, 5, 7] to the global hydrocarbon sector, including       BP, TOTAL, ExxonMobil, Hess, Neftex, Maersk, Marathon, Petronas, Shell,       Tullow and others.
b) Commercial advantage to end-users:Clair           Joint Venture Group       SGRG research findings and expertise have had impacts for the development       of the Clair Ridge Project by the Clair Joint Venture Group [8-10]       (CJVG; a consortium of BP, Shell, ConocoPhillips and Chevron).
The Clair       field is the largest hydrocarbon resource in the UKCS with an estimated 8       billion barrels of Stock Tank oil initially in place (STOIIP) [11].
The Phase I area came on stream in 2005, whilst the Clair Ridge (Phase II)       is due to begin production in 2016.
The reservoir target is Devonian       sandstones that rest directly on Lewisian-like metamorphic basement.
Both       rock units are highly faulted and fracture description and water flood       performance are considered to be the two main risks in field development.
This risk is exacerbated by a lack of industry experience in working with       metamorphic basement rocks [8-10].
The Durham research that has so far contributed directly towards       addressing these risks stems from the analysis of the fault and fracture       systems developed in the Lewisian Complex of NW Scotland as an onshore       analogue for the fractured basement in the Clair Field [9, 10].
The Durham research results were acquired using the GAVA methodology.
Quantitative data concerning the geometry, density, aperture and nature of       infills were incorporated into the structural model for the Phase II Clair       Ridge by the CJVG [9, 10].
The basement fracture framework is       known to be directly connected to the overlying reservoir impacting       subsequent fluid flow movement across and through the oilfield.
The       structural model is used to derive a detailed reservoir simulation on       which an economic assessment is made, with up to 36 new development wells       for the Ridge planned.
In 2013, BP announced a further two year appraisal       Programme to develop a third Phase involving the drilling of up to 12 more       wells in the Greater Clair area [11].
Each development well costs       upwards of &#163;20M and the decision to sanction the entire development       programme is significant in both financial and economic terms [8-10,         12-14].
Since 2008, the SGRG have additionally led annual field workshops with       CJVG geoscientists (42 individuals to date) to view the complex nature of       the fractured basement in NW Scotland.
This has helped the industry       subsurface teams to better conceptualise the structural framework in the       basement and to design improved alternative fracture models [9, 10].
Fracture networks within the reservoir are known to boost the average       permeability by orders of magnitude and allow economic oil production       rates in otherwise unpromising metamorphic rocks.
The CJVG Basement       Sub-surface Team Leader (ConocoPhillips) [9] has stated that:     "The basement fracture models used in our reservoir simulator to         estimate recovery are substantially based on the Durham onshore data and         are additionally informed by knowledge gained during the field         workshops.
Populating the fractures into a Discrete Fracture Network         (DFN) model requires a complete understanding of the interaction between         all scales of fractures observed from large seismic scale faults to         small sub-seismic scale joints.
The model has been built and run,         showing an economically robust project.
This ultimately led (in 2012) to         the sanctioning of the Clair Ridge for development &#8212; an investment of         around &#163;4.5 billion" [11]     c) Commercial advantage to end-users:Statoil/Jardfeingi,           Faroe-Shetland Basin       The Faeroe-Shetland Basin is one of the most important exploration targets       in the UKCS region [13].
It is geologically challenging as it is       strongly faulted and associated with substantial volumes of Tertiary       volcanics.
The SGRG research into basalt-hosted faulting in the Faroes       (Walker, Holdsworth, Imber) is considered by both Statoil and Jardfeingi       (a Faroes-run consortium of companies) to be the definitive study.
The       Leading Geoscientist in this area (Statoil) [14] writes: "The         findings have been of great benefit in the search for oil beneath the         basalts and, by changing our understanding of the nature and         significance of NW-SE `transfer zones', have definitely influenced our         exploration strategies in the Faroe-Shetland Basin."
It is difficult       here to precisely quantify the value of the Durham contribution, but in a       frontier area of this kind, improved predictions in the subsurface lead to       commercial advantages with values typically running into tens of millions       of pounds or more [13-14].
