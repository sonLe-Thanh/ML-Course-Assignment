     Contribution to re-framing national and international systems for         research assessment:     Furlong and Oancea's work on the quality of applied and practice-based       research was referenced and explicitly drawn upon in the working methods       and criteria statement of the RAE 2008 Education sub-panel.
The Working       Criteria for UOA45 state: "the sub-panel adopts Furlong and Oancea's       definition of applied and practice-based research (definition quoted)" [see         in section 5: C1, para 19].
The Chair of the 2008 RAE sub-panel       describes the use and influence of this work as follows: "After the         panel all read the document, we discussed it and as a result decided to         adopt many of the conceptual distinctions and recommendations to help us         define our research field and our attitude to assessing research from         different traditions, in particular our valuing of practice-based         research.
It was the only publication referenced in our document on         Criteria and Ways of Working, which outlined our intended approach... We         made use of the report in agreeing on assessment judgements in the areas         of environment and esteem as well as in assessing outputs.
Thus the         publication made a significant difference to assessment judgements,         including encouraging the agreement to a different set of values from         that used in 2001 in order to give greater respect to applied research.
These judgements in turn of course affected research funding of         education departments from 2009 onwards, favouring those with a greater         proportion of applied research rather more than previously.
The report         was also circulated by the RAE organisers to members of more than ten         other panels...
It was the only publication used at a meeting of these         members called by the 2008 RAE team to ensure that judgements from         different panels in this area were comparable and used the same         conceptual and value framework."
[C2]     Internationally, the research has contributed to re-framing debates about       research assessment systems (e.g.
in New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong)       and to stronger recognition of the value of applied and practice-based       research in education and other social sciences and humanities.
In New       Zealand, the 2009 review of the national assessment system, the       Performance-Based Research Fund (for the redesign of its 2012 round),       referenced this work as a "basis for more extended debate of research         assessment" [C3, p.6].
The consultation paper endorsed the       argument that a shift in how research assessment is framed is required,       rather than minor technical tweaks: "While some issues may be         alleviated by comparatively minor changes to guidelines and assessment         practices, the major issues demand the kind of robust national debate         called for by Furlong and Oancea...
Such a debate could involve         professional and industrial bodies as well as academics and could well         be initiated by the TEC (Tertiary Education Commission)" [C3,         p.14].
In addition, the research has been referenced in official reports and led       to policy and practice-oriented events and publications in Australia, New       Zealand, Hong Kong, Canada, and Sweden.
For example, the Social Sciences       and Humanities Research Council of Canada repeatedly references Oancea and       Furlong's revised quality framework [R1] as one of the few       contributions to cutting-edge efforts "to developing the theoretical         and philosophical dimensions of research assessment" [C4, p. 28].
In Europe, Oancea applied the impact and quality frameworks as invited       critical friend (2009-11) to the EC FP7 European Educational Research       Quality Indicators project, which included 6 European countries and       several industry partners.
Furlong's research expertise led to his current       appointments as Convenor of the Education panel for the Hong Kong 2014 RAE       and as member of the International Panel of Experts for the Social       Sciences for the 2013 Latvian RAE.
Contribution to stakeholders' understanding of, and strategies for,         quality and impact:     The research [R1] was influential in the ESRC; in a previous ESRC       Chief Executive's words, "following its publication in 2004 Furlong and         Oancea's work played a key role in ESRC's thinking for at least the rest         of the decade...The framework which came directly from Furlong and         Oancea's work had applications beyond education research into cognate         disciplines where we desire that professional practice is informed by         world class research; and longevity in that it will be relevant for many         years to come.
It is, in my view, a truly world class example of         research impact."
[C5]     Early dissemination included the ESRC's production and distribution of       around 2000 gloss-print briefings on the project findings, together with       suggestions for tailored use by evaluation agencies.
Furlong and Oancea       were invited to brief the ESRC Chief Executive personally, resulting in       commissioned follow-up work in 2005.
In evidence to the House of Commons       Science and Technology Committee on the work of the ESRC, the Chief       Executive described the "excellent" 2004 draft Furlong and Oancea report       as the ESRC's way of addressing the problems arising from the fact that       "research related to professional practice has been said not to be       properly reflected in the research assessment exercise which looks at       academia" and recommended that the RAE 2008 panels in education and in       other disciplines draw upon it explicitly in their guidelines to ensure       that applied research and non-standard outputs are judged in their own       terms (Hansard, 24/10/ 2004, Q78).
The framework was referenced in the       2006 ESRC demographic review of the social sciences and featured highly in       a 2005 ESRC seminar series on research quality.
It was recommended for use       in social work and social care by the 2007 ESRC/Social Care Institute for       Excellence review of these fields, published in article form in 2008 [C6],       and also referenced in the 2009 ESRC Strategic Adviser for Social Work and       Social Care report.
Reporting on the ESRC/SCIE review, Shaw and Norton       (2008) state: "We think the framework developed by Furlong and Oancea         (2005) will serve with some modification for other applied social         sciences, including social work" [C6, p.967].
These       interactions led to impact accumulated over time, post-2008.
Also       recently, the Chair of the ESRC Research Evaluation Committee was briefed       personally by Oancea on findings from the 2010-11 study on impact [R5].
According to email communication (2011/12), the "hugely interesting"       report was taken forward to the ESRC evaluation team.
Between 2008 and 2010, the report [R1] was a core document for       the understanding of quality in the multiple-stakeholder Strategic Forum       for Research in Education (SFRE), funded by the ESRC, BERA, DfE, and CfBT       [C7].
Speaking about BERA and SFRE, the BERA President commented in       her address that "BERA needs to be at the forefront of these debates,         extending and developing the work of Furlong and Oancea on assessing         quality in applied and practice-based research" (Munn, 2008).
In       2009, Oancea was further commissioned by the TLRP to do a review on       quality criteria and impact, and became a member of SFRE's Planning Group       [C7].
The work has been used in policy-initiated evaluations of research, such       as the evaluation of the Applied Educational Research Scheme in Scotland       (Scottish Government, 2008).
The 2005 version of Furlong and Oancea was       also included on the selected list of useful publications on evaluating       policy recommended by Policy Hub, the website of the Government Social       Research Unit (2008).
Oancea's broader work on research policy and       practice (since 2004) was central to shaping the direction of policy       campaigns by the British Educational Research Association and       Universities' Council for the Education of Teachers in 2004-05 and in       2012-13.
The 2010 report by Oancea [R6] was the basis for BERA and       UCET's responses to the REF 2014 consultations.
In addition, BERA and UCET       ran five targeted sessions on the findings from 2010 and a subsequent 2012       joint report, two for heads of department and three for directors of       research from over 50 HEIs.
Participants to these events remarked on the       direct practical relevance of the findings to strategic planning for their       departments in the period 2010-2014 [C8].
Use in postgraduate training and researcher development practice:     The quality framework has been used in postgraduate degree specification       and training courses across the UK and beyond.
For example, the programme       specification for the EdD (professional doctorate) offered by Exeter       University includes the Furlong and Oancea framework as one of two       documents used in lieu of "doctoral level benchmarks in Education"       [C9], while the staff CPD Academic Practice programme in       Northumbria University (2009) recommends it as criteria for participants'       own work.
The framework has been used as quality standard in MSc       and EdD theses by teacher researchers (e.g.
Spiro, 2008) and applied in       PhD theses in education and social work (e.g.
Cockerill, 2012, Jarvis,       2011).
Best-selling research methods textbooks in the social sciences       (e.g.
Cohen, Manion and Morrison, 2011; Shaw et al, 2009) and       methods textbooks in education (Scott and Usher, 2011; McNiff and       Whitehead, 2009) also use the Furlong and Oancea framework in their       discussion of research quality.
They draw strongly on it in their       companion materials, including teaching materials made available online.
A       video for students and new researchers across the range of social       sciences, drawing on the research programme, was produced and disseminated       by SAGE: Oancea, A.
(2010) Quality of research: How do I know if my         research findings are any good?
(SAGE).
The video is available from       SAGE Research Methods Online.
The work has been used by practitioners and practitioner researchers in       education and other fields to develop critical reflection on the quality       and use of research.
Examples from education include sharing the work with       the National Teacher Research Panel (2010) and with practitioner       stakeholders through the Strategic Forum for Research in Education       (2008-10).
The Social Care Institute for Excellence used insights from       this work to shape the definition of research given in their 2012 online       resource for the research-based professional development of social care       practitioners [C10].
RAND Europe is using the impact indicators       study in presentations to impact assessment policy and practice       communities (e.g.
the DESCRIBE project, 2013) [C11].
Details of       engagement and dissemination activities enabling these impacts are held on       file.
