     Context     Nuclear magnetic resonance is one of the most important and powerful       analytical tools used by chemists.
It is able to determine, for example,       the composition of a mixture, the structures of complex molecules, and the       mobilities of these molecules.
However, to direct the complex and       precisely-timed sequences of radiofrequency and magnetic field pulses that       are used in an NMR spectrometer to measure these different properties of       substances is a science in itself.
The Impact described in this case       relates to the development and commercial exploitation of one such family       of pulse sequences, known as DOSY, that is able to analyse complex       mixtures in a unique manner that has proved vital to industrial research       and product development.
Pathways to impact     The initial impetus for our developments in DOSY came from an industrial       collaboration with Pfizer Global Research, and led to dedicated processing       software which was initially shared widely but informally with other       users.
The subsequent development of DOSY software for the proprietary       operating system of the major NMR manufacturer Varian (now Agilent) gave       both the opportunity to exploit the intellectual property generated, and       an effective vehicle for disseminating the results to a wide range of       users including many industrial research organisations.
Key contributors       to this Impact were the School policy of maintaining shared       high-resolution NMR facilities, and the assistance of UMIP (University of       Manchester Intellectual Property management agent) in negotiating the       licensing of DOSY software.
In parallel, open-source DOSY processing code       was made available through the DOSY Toolbox, which is now in use in 68       countries and has contributed to a significant shift in practice and       capacity in industrial research.
Since the commercialisation of this technique many of the 100 or so papers     on DOSY published each year are from industry, but inevitably only a small     proportion of industrial use of DOSY is captured by such a metric.
"... the       interest in, and use of, DOSY in the pharmaceutical industry is far       greater than that evidenced by publications in the public domain.
The       majority of applications are at later stages of product development, when       information on mixture composition is most valuable, and here publishing       opportunities are very limited because of confidentiality concerns."
(Vice-President R&amp;D, Mestrelab Research) [A]     In addition to the widespread use of our data processing software, DOSY       experiments developed at Manchester have now been incorporated into the       software of almost all commercial high-resolution NMR equipment.
"The         overwhelming majority of DOSY users are dealing with mixtures of small         organic or inorganic molecules but there are scientists at bio-NMR sites         where DOSY is regularly used to monitor molecular associations."
(Applications Scientist, Agilent) [B]     DOSY NMR has had fundamental impact in a diverse range of important       sectors that include pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, petrochemicals, and       flavours and fragrances.
"Mixture analysis using NMR is a large,         diverse problem that relies on a number of techniques.
DOSY is widely         perceived to be vital technology for this purpose."
(Vice-President       R&amp;D, Mestrelab Research) [A]     Impact     The principal impacts associated with DOSY NMR are:     1 "The performance of an existing business has been improved through         the introduction of new ... products".
Our DOSY experimental methods       and data processing software have allowed new products to be developed,       with major economic impact.
For example, the flavourings and fragrances       manufacturer Givaudan used DOSY to discover a new flavour ingredient,       generating a total sales growth for that product alone of more than 50M       CHF (&#163;35m) over the REF period, which is more than 20 % compared to the       status quo.
(Researcher, Givaudan) [C]     2 "A business or sector has adopted a new or significantly changed         technology".
Our DOSY methods have generated major changes in       capacity and practice in industrial research; the last time industry       changed its use of NMR to such an extent was with the introduction of       multidimensional methods in the 1980s.
For example, Givaudan now analyse       approximately 20 % of all NMR samples using DOSY.
Syngenta, one of the       world's leading agricultural science companies, uses DOSY to assist in       reducing the environmental impact associated with the use of its       plant-protection products by optimising plant protection formulations, and       " ... to measure the rate of diffusion of plant protection compounds in         water which will help us understand their breakdown in the environment         ...
The `One-Shot' sequence [reference 3 above] ... is our         preferred method of acquiring DOSY NMR spectra because it increases         throughput on our NMR spectrometers."
(Researcher, Syngenta) [D].
At       the multinational chemical manufacturer DuPont, DOSY is now used in "30%         of our projects ... mostly fluorochemical studies, but really studying         all kinds of reaction mixtures" (Researcher, DuPont) [E].
3 "The performance of an existing business has been improved through         ... the adoption of new, updated or enhanced technical standards and/or         protocols".Manchester's collaborative research and development of       DOSY NMR software with Varian (now Agilent) has positioned that company as       a leading global supplier of commercial DOSY NMR software.
Software       developed specifically for Varian spectrometers was first licensed to them       in 2001 in a barter deal.
In 2010, Varian licensed through the University       of Manchester's exclusive intellectual property company, UMIP Ltd, updated       software developed at the University of Manchester for incorporation into       their VnmrJ software, giving Varian/Agilent a key competitive advantage.
"Since         incorporation of the advanced tools supplied by your group for DOSY data         collection and analysis into our software suite in 2009 we have licensed         51 copies of your program to academic and 31 copies to industrial         customers in connection with new instrument sales ...
The 82       instruments referred to here cost between US$250k and several $m each and,       therefore, DOSY has given this manufacturer of NMR equipment a competitive       advantage that has contributed to several $10m's of instrument sales since       2009.
It is rare, almost exceptional, that beyond producing breaking         scientific results and first class publications, a research group puts         so much extra effort into making their developments widely accessible         and usable by the whole NMR community."
