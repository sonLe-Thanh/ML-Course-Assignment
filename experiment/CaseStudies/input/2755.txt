     Haemophilia B patients have a defective factor IX gene and cannot make       the protein factor IX, which is essential for normal blood clot formation.
They suffer from frequent, often life-threatening, bleeding episodes that       occur without any apparent injury.
Current treatment involves injection of       factor IX protein concentrates every two to three days for the life-time       of the patient.
This treatment is invasive, extremely expensive (&#163;150,000       per year) and only available to 20% of the world's haemophilia patients       who live in high income countries.
Importantly, this treatment is not       curative and patients continue to bleed despite prophylactic factor IX       treatment which by necessity is administered intermittently, resulting in       significant periods when the plasma level is below 1% of normal.
Gene therapy overcomes these limitations by replacing the damaged factor       IX gene with a normal copy, thus allowing the patient to make factor IX       protein continuously without the need for regular injections.
Our recent       study showed that a single injection of our novel AAV vector into six       patients with severe haemophilia B resulted in an increase in blood FIX       levels from undetectable levels before gene therapy to between 1-6% of       normal in all participants for a period that now extends to over three       years.
Four of the six patients have been able to stop regular injections with       FIX protein and still remain free of spontaneous bleeding episodes.
This       is despite engaging in activities such as playing football and running a       marathon that had previously been associated with bleeding.
The first       patient commented "This type of solution is something permanent and can         make a lot of difference".
The sixth patient said "I have not         needed any of my normal treatment, either preventative or on-demand as a         result of an injury.
Previously, I used to infuse at home three times a         week ....
I play football, run and take part in triathlons &#8212; and         previously I might have had to infuse both before I took part and         possibly after as well.
Not having to do that has been absolutely         brilliant" [a].
This, the first gene therapy success for haemophilia in the world, has       been lauded by experts in the field [b].
The results have been       widely covered by the media, including the BBC and the New York Times       amongst other news outlets across the world [c].
It has also been       covered on patient-facing websites [c].
There has been a significant saving to the NHS just from the first six       patients treated through reduction or elimination of the need for FIX       protein concentrates, amounting to more than &#163;1.5m, a figure which       increases with each month that passes.
This approach has recently been       extended to four more patients who were all treated at the high dose level       and are expressing factor IX at 5-8% level over a follow-up period of 9-18       months.
Indeed, the same approach is now being developed by Nathwani and       Tuddenham for haemophilia A, the most common severe inherited bleeding       disorder affecting approximately 1 in 5,000 males.
Patents for the novel       factor VIII expression cassette has been filed [e] and recently       licensed to BioMarin for [text removed for publication] [f].
This development is prompting increased investment in research, and is       accelerating clinical trials for gene therapy of haemophilia A.
