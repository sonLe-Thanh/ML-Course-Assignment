     Note: All superscript references within this section refer to       corroborating sources listed in Section 5     Most projects studying recent environmental change as recorded in natural       archives such as lake       sediments involve teams of scientists working on a range of environmental       indicators.
Decisions       on environmental issues are generally based on findings from many       different sources, and may       have long-term impacts.
Ongoing work with colleagues studying sediment       records in Siberia is       one of many investigations informing the debate on climate change in the       Arctic.
Below are brief       accounts, supported by letters from lead contacts, of three recent       projects with more limited       objectives and readily identifiable impacts.
Western Airborne Contaminants Assessment Project (WACAP)1       The lead contact for this USEPA funded project, carried out during 2002-7,       was Dr Dixon H.       Landers, Senior Research Environmental Scientist at the U.S. Environmental       Protection Agency.
The main results were reported in 20081 and a summary       (including initial impacts and actions) in       20092.
According to a letter from Dr Landers3, the       project has had wide ranging impacts on       chemical registration decisions, new research, conservation actions and       decisions relating to       regulation of pollution sources.
The knowledge framework has been used to       inform various       regulatory bodies3 concerned with the impact of emissions from       industrial sources and agricultural       uses of pesticides.
The Liverpool role in providing dated profiles made a       major contribution to two       main elements of the project.
First, to compare current contaminant       deposition rates with those       from historic, pre-industrial times.
Second, to explicitly link the       sediment records to increases in       airborne contaminants from "regional" sources.
Dr Landers describes       Appleby and Piliposyan's       contribution as "authoritative" and confirms that their "careful         and thorough work was a key         component in the high level of success that WACAP has enjoyed".
To be precise, according to Dr Landers3, the sediment work by       Appleby and Piliposyan "provided         strong evidence on the extent to which recent increases in Hg         contamination ... were due to         emissions from local or regional sources, as opposed to higher global         background concentrations".
There are presently a number of research efforts funded by the NPS       (National Parks Service) and       other government and non-government organizations building on these       results.
As Dr Landers       states3, "the WACAP data has been used to help select which         parks to target for this research" by       identifying the sites most at risk from local Hg emissions.
Moreover the sediment records resulting from Appleby and Piliposyan's work       for WACAP "have         been most useful in helping NPS understand which Historic Use Pesticides         continue to persist in         park ecosystems often well after they have been banned, and which         Current Use Pesticides are         beginning to increase in park ecosystems over time."
In particular,       data supplied by Appleby and       Piliposyan on the residual incidence of the pesticide Endosulfan in the       natural environment was a       major part of the evidence base which resulted in the UN decision to ban       it.
As Dr Landers states,         "Data on the temporal record of the presence of the widely-used         insecticide Endosulfan obtained         from WACAP sediment records was entered as evidence of the long term         persistence and         widespread occurrence of this substance in hearings that preceded the         [United Nations] decision to         ban it".
In 2011, Endosulfan was added to the UN list of persistent       organic pollutants to be       eliminated worldwide4.
Restoration of mosquito control ditches on Fire Island, New York       This US National Park Service funded project, led by Dr Roman (NPS) and       Professor John King       (University of Rhode Island), was designed to provide evidence concerning       plans to restore       marshes on the Fire Island National Seashore that decades earlier had been       ditched for mosquito       abatement.
In a letter5, Prof King says that the work of       Appleby and Piliposyan "provided important         information for environmental managers at the National Park Service"       and "supported a         management option that will save considerable money".
Specifically,       the NPS needed to make a       decision whether to actively fill in the ditches, "a costly and major         undertaking" according to       Professor King5, or leave them alone to fill in naturally.
Dr       Roman confirmed in an e-mail6 that       Appleby and Piliposyan's research was "instrumental in the NPS decision         to allow human made         ditches at Fire Island National Seashore to fill naturally".
The       Liverpool role was to analyse and       date sediment cores from various locations on Fire Island.
210Pb       records in salt-marsh sediment       cores were used to determine the rate of sea level rise7.
210Pb       records in sediment cores from the       ditches were used to determine current natural sediment accumulation rates8.
The results       (published in 20128) suggested that natural inundation would       best achieve the desired goal.
In       consequence management has subsequently decided on the non-intervention       option; Professor       King states in his letter5 that "the paper which resulted from       this work [Ref.
8 below] is being       applied now".
This has resulted in a considerable financial saving to the       NPS.
Use of antifoulant paints in UK inland waters       The lead contact for this English Nature, DEFRA and NERC funded project,       carried out during       2000-3, was Dr Carl Sayer of University College London (UCL).
The main       purpose was to       determine the cause of the ecological degradation of the Norfolk Broads       shallow lake system, one       of the suspects being the use of toxic tributyltin (TBT) in boat       antifouling paints.
The Liverpool role       was to date sediment cores from the Broads.
The resulting chronology was       used by UCL to       reconstruct the historical record of TBTs in the lake waters.
The results,       widely reported in the       media, demonstrated not only that TBT was a key contributory factor but       also that previously       contaminated sediments acted as a long-term reservoir for pollution in       spite of the world-wide ban       on the use of TBTs that came into force in 2008.
The Senior Ecologist at       the Broads Authority, Dr       Andrea Kelly, confirms in a letter9 that "as a consequence         of this work and subsequent media         coverage the Broads Authority initiated a campaign to promote         environmentally friendly antifoulant         use in the Broads system".
This ongoing campaign informs their       current advice to boat users10, and       as Dr Kelly states9, "this research... has been influential         in informing the authorities policy and         strategic conservation direction in regard to policy on ecoboating and         anti-foulant paint use on the         Broads" and developing literature for the 2013 Green Boat Show on       the Broads10.
