     The impact of the research on insolvency legislation is reflected in its       constructive usage by a wide       range of beneficiaries, particularly insolvency practitioners.
This       research, as embodied ultimately       in the latest edition of the Annotated Guide, is used to       shape the       understanding/policy/advice/argument/decision-making by a range of users.
Taken together the aforementioned research has:       - informed legal and accountancy practice in the sense that Sealy and       Milman is a standard       reference work in firms specialising in insolvency practice.
It is       sometimes called the industry       "bible" (Turnaroundweek 24/5/11, Insolvencynews         7/7/11) or the "blue book" (by reference to       the predominant colour used on its cover since 1985).
Some indication of       its status is to be       found in the aftermath of Minmar         [2011] EWHC 1159 (Ch) where Chancellor Morritt disagreed       with our interpretation of the law.
This lead to great consternation       amongst practitioners and       further litigation, the bulk of which supported our view of the law.
See R3         Technical Bulletin No       96 (July 2011) at 96.2.
Commenting on this controversial decision, one       firm of legal       practitioners (Paris Smith LLP) said in its legal blog of November 21st       2011 that it is no longer       good enough to say that "we         did what Sealy and Milman told us to do".
That back-handed       compliment indicates the work's status in the professional psyche.
The       standing of the text as       a standard commentary is reflected by the fact that judges now comment on       it when it does       not provide a view on a contested point.
- offered guidance to judges in the UK and overseas on disputed points of       law.
In terms of       establishing change, for example, the decision in Linfoot           v Adamson [2012] EWHC Misc 16       (CC) was clearly influenced by the commentary on s. 303 as HHJ Behrens       quoted that       commentary in para [56] of the judgment.
In contrast, in a number of cases       the courts have       disagreed with what has been said in the commentary and, having engaged in       the debate, the       authors have taken the opportunity to clarify what has been said in the       text.
Because of the       weekly Westlaw updating facility for the electronic version of this Guide       (available through       subscription since 2010), we can change the text immediately and thereby       provide new advice       to users based upon the most recent judicial insights.
- aided policymakers considering legal reform.
The Annotated Guide       has been referred to in Hong       Kong in the discussion about reforms to the Companies Act &#8212; see Bills           Committee (22/6/11)       Annexe A footnotes 2 and 5, and Bills         Committee (2/12/11) Annex         B footnote 9.
- provided a vademecum designed for daily use by private sector       practitioners and the Official       Receiver's staff.
Close contact is maintained between the authors of Sealy       and Milman and       the Insolvency Service (a major customer).
Letters on file support the       high demand from end       users and the significant utility of the research.
The new ebook       application further enhances       utility.
- enabled the author to interact with the relevant users via delivery of       expert seminars for Central       Law Training (several since 2008), the Insolvency Lawyers' Association       (Annual Conferences       2010, 2012), Exchange Chambers(15/3/11, 19/10/11, 14/3/12, 18/9/12,       19/9/12 and 20/3/13)       the Northern Circuit Commercial Bar Association (11/7/13) and in-house       clients (College of       Law course for DLA Piper).
- provided economic benefits to the legal publishing sector through its       high customer demand (see       Wildy's bestseller lists) and frequent publication cycle.
(Publishers can       confirm.)
- been of value to a variety of users as a source of legal information       (e.g see Authors' Licensing       and Collecting Society statement, available from the UoA).
- been recognised by Exchange Chambers in 2010 in the form of an       invitation to Milman to become       a Professorial         Associate.
This has enhanced the linkage between his research and       day to day       legal practice.
- facilitated Milman to provide expert headnotes since 1996 for the       Bankruptcy and Personal       Insolvency Law Reports published by Jordans.
These judicially approved       reports are cited       continually in the courts.
Sealy and Milman has been cited by 18 different judges in       at least 27 English law cases reported       since January 2008.

This extensive citation       attests to wide usage.
The reach of the work goes beyond English law - the       text has been cited in       Northern Ireland in Re           Sheridan Millennium Ltd [2011] NICh 23 at [45] per McCloskey       J, in the       Dubai International Financial Centre Court of Appeal in         Re Orion Holdings Overseas Ltd  (CA       004/2011, 7 December 2011) at [6 ] per Justice Sir John Chadwick and in       the High Court of Ireland       in Re           Harley Medical Group (Ireland) Ltd [2013] IEHC 29 at [15] and       [23] per Laffoy J.     Milman had also for several years up to 2012, in association with the       College of Law, run an in-house         programme       for the international law firm DLA Piper, participation in which could       lead to a       qualification with the College.
