     The impact of the above research is seen through several aspects in the       REF period:            Changes in international policy and guidelines       Changes in operations of international organisations       Changes in national strategies 	         Cost-effective wastewater reuse for agriculture is becoming an         increasingly urgent issue for many         countries facing severe water stress.
WHO estimates that globally 20         million ha, or 7% of total         irrigated land, is at least partly reliant on wastewater or other         polluted water.
Studies show that         several countries are heavily reliant on wastewater for irrigation e.g.
the percentage of urban         consumption of fresh vegetables irrigated by wastewater is 60% in         Shanghai, 80% in Hanoi and         90% in Accra [Journal of Water and Health, vol.
8, pp.572-576.
2010].
Such figures are repeated         elsewhere, but local authorities and producers are reluctant to publish         figures due to the possible         public disquiet on the issue.
Food grown with irrigation from wastewater is not only consumed locally         and much of it is exported.
For example, UK and European supermarkets sell food irrigated in this         way and clearly need to         ensure that this is done to acceptable standards.
GLOBALG.A.P.
(http://www.globalgap.org)         represents the major UK and European supermarkets; it sets standards for         the certification of         production processes of agricultural products around the globe, and         serves as a practical manual         for Good Agricultural Practice (G.A.P.)
anywhere in the world.
Recognising the scale of wastewater         re-use in agriculture, GLOBALG.A.P has followed WHO policies on         wastewater use and food from         countries not complying with WHO standards is likely to be rejected.
Figures on the exact amount         of food covered by this are difficult to obtain as retailers and         producers are reluctant to divulge         figures due to public attitudes.
However, given that the UK alone         imports nearly half its food the         trade is significant.
The Leeds researchers were key to the research behind the WHO policy as         confirmed by [A]         "...the team at Leeds played a significant and central role in the         development of the risk-based         approach to setting wastewater reuse standards...", [B] "Basic         scientific research carried out by the         team at Leeds was used in the establishment of the approach and in         setting acceptable levels of         health risk" and [C] "...the University of Leeds has played an important         role in developing new         approaches to assess and manage the risk associated with wastewater         reuse, and in helping to         operationalize the 2006 Guidelines...".
Changing international policy and guidelines       The scientific justification for risk-based standards for wastewater         reuse developed on the basis of this         research at Leeds and others, has enabled the widespread adoption of         safe and affordable wastewater         irrigation in the REF period as confirmed by WHO and the World Bank [A,         B, C].
In 2010 the World         Bank issued a Policy Research Working Paper [C, D] on wastewater re-use         of which Mara was a         co-author and adopted a quantitative risk-based approach to wastewater         re-use which extends the         scope of water re-use to crop irrigation [C, D].
Prior to 2010 less than         1% of the World Bank's         portfolio of wastewater investments included provision for reuse so this         was a significant change in         approach.
The adoption of the QMRA approach and risk-based regulation by         organisations such as WHO and         the World Bank has led to its adoption around the globe, especially in         countries with strongly-         governed water markets (see below) [C, D].
Changes in operations of international organisations       The impact on policy has in turn been operationalized through the World         Bank commissioning         country-level analyses (2010 [C]) to assess the potential and benefits         of wastewater re-use.
For         example, work by Barbara Evans (Leeds) for the World Bank [E] on the         Nile Basin (where close to         10 billion m3 of drainage water is used in agriculture         annually) developed a QMRA-based         methodology to identify the most cost-effective wastewater treatment         options in specific drainage         basins of the Nile delta [C, E].
Use of the methodology in the study         identified lower-cost waste         management options that are as much as six times more cost-effective         (expressed as dollars spent         per Disability-adjusted Life-Year saved in health terms) than the         conventional high-energy         wastewater treatment processes currently favoured [E].
This is described         by the World Bank as         "one of the first practical examples of how to operationalize the 2006         WHO Guidelines and the         2010 World Bank Policy Research Paper" [C]       Changing national strategies for agricultural development and           practice       The main example of impact in the REF period is through the World Bank         policy and operations         cited above.
However, the reach of this impact can be seen from the         following examples of         countries which have adopted elements of the approach developed with         inputs from the team at         Leeds include:                Australia: senate now requires states to include elements of water           recycling in infrastructure           redevelopment programmes;         Jordan: upgraded treatment through a private-sector           build-operate-transfer scheme [F];         Tunisia: now treats most of its urban wastewater, uses 30% of the           treated effluent to irrigate           7,000 ha of fruit trees and fodder crops following strict sanitary           standards, and plans to           expand wastewater irrigation to 20,000-30,000 ha by 2020 [G: Page           167];         50% of Israel's irrigation water is provided from sewage [H] and           this is being expanded [I].
The impact of the above on food production has been on-going during           the REF impact period.
Continuing developments       Mara has continued to work with WHO, to review the approach.
Further use of the QMRA tools         developed at Leeds has led to a call for a further relaxation of some of         the health-risk thresholds         used in the 2006 Guidelines, which would make wastewater reuse more         cost-effective in poor         countries [for example J].
