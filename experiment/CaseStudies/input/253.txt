     "RODOS is now used operationally for emergency preparedness         (planning), for training and for         emergency response in case of a nuclear accident in several European         countries including         Germany, Finland, Spain, Portugal, Austria, the Netherlands, Poland,         Hungary, Slovakia, Ukraine,         Slovenia, and the Czech Republic" [18].
RODOS is in continual use in       these countries, and is also       implemented in research, training and planning centres in many other       countries (30 installations in       22 countries overall [18]), and used at European and international levels       to plan and run exercises,       providing the tools for a coherent, consistent and harmonised response.
India has developed a       version, IRODOS, for evaluation and research.
The UK, while not planning       to use a full system       such as RODOS, uses many of its modules in stand-alone or smaller systems.
During the       Fukushima Crisis of 2011 RODOS was used in several studies for individual       countries and       internationally as part of the assessment of the impacts [16, 19].
The current version of RODOS incorporates many modules which implement       the designs and       methods proposed by Smith and French in the 1990s [7, 8, 9].
These       implementations have been       engineered into the operational version of RODOS by many partners to the       project during the last       decade.
Comparing the 25 papers in the special issue of Radioprotection       [7], which summarises       much of the functionality of current RODOS implementations, with the early       design paper [3] shows       the strong influence that this paper has had in shaping the current       system.
The impact of the work by Smith and French has been to influence public       policy towards response       to nuclear contamination, increasing the security and safety of       populations living near nuclear plant       and, indeed, those further afield.
Their research "shaped the design of       uncertainty handling, data       assimilation and evaluation within the RODOS system" which was important       because "the       treatment of uncertainty in a consistent manner throughout the system was       (however) identified at       an early stage as a key area for development" [16].
The current co-ordinator of the RODOS Development Activities states "I       can confirm that many of       the concepts ideas and advice that you promulgated in the development       teams over the years       have been implemented within the operational versions of RODOS" [17] and       this view is supported       by the Chairman of the International RODOS Users Group "The current       version of RODOS       incorporates many modules which implement the designs and methods proposed       by Smith and       French".
Recently the RODOS system has "performed well in predicting the       impact of the       accidental releases from the Fukushima Daiichi NPP in March 2011 &#8212; both in       Japan and more       widely &#8212; and in effectively informing relevant decision makers" [16, 19].
Specifically, RODOS and related systems draw on the impetus given by       Smith and French in       using:            Belief nets to estimate the probabilities of different source terms         during the threat stage         [10].
Kalman Filtering and related Bayesian forecasting methods in short-,         medium- and long-         range atmospheric dispersion models and in hydrological models [9, 11].
Bayesian spatio-temporal models to provide estimates of ground         contamination into the         long term [7].
MCDA modules to support the evaluation of different countermeasure         strategies including         an exploration of constraint satisfaction to construct feasible         strategies and an explanation         system to interpret the outputs into natural language [7-9, 12-14].
In addition, many of the RODOS modules and design features are shared       with the Danish ARGOS       system, which is used within several Scandinavian countries and elsewhere       in the World.
ARGOS       implements the same methodologies but using a different system       architecture.
The underlying       understanding of nuclear emergency response and recovery, evident in the       designs of Smith and       French [3, 4], have also been incorporated into the motivation of the       NERIS platform (www.eu-neris.net),       which provides a forum for dialogue and methodological development between       all       European organisations and associations taking part in decision making of       protective actions in       nuclear and radiological emergencies and recovery in Europe.
NERIS, in       which Warwick is a UK       partner along with Public Health England (PHE), is concerned, among other       things, to integrate       RODOS into local, national and international emergency management       processes and develop its       use with a broad range of stakeholders.
The use of Kalman filtering in atmospheric dispersion is implemented to       varying degrees at short,       medium and long ranges; some implementations are stand-alone [7, 9, 11].
Constraint satisfaction       approaches to the coarse expert system are not in the current       implementation, but the methods       augmented by case-based reasoning methodology are being evaluated in the       newly funded EU       FP7 PREPARE project (http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/rcn/106584_en.html,       &#8364;6.4m).
The early       issues relating to the tractability of Kalman filtering led to theoretical       developments of dynamic       belief nets and fast algorithms [5, 6].
There is a current recognition of       the need to develop       explanation systems for MCDA and other decision support tools, and the       success of the       explanation tool within the fine expert system of RODOS is being taken a       key example [15].
Smith and French are partners in a research project Management of         Nuclear Risk Issues:         Environmental, Financial and Safety (NREFS), funded by the EPSRC as       part of a UK-India Civil       Nuclear Research Collaboration.
Its objective is to re-evaluate, following       Fukushima, some of the       fundamental thinking about the emergency management of a radiation       accident, particularly in       early phase decisions on evacuation and the establishment of exclusion       zones.
