     Process from Research to Impact: Given that the 1962 Conference       helped to set in motion what       became, in 1983, the Edinburgh International Book Festival (EIBF), Bartie       and Bell had the idea of       working in partnership with the EIBF to organise events to commemorate the       anniversary.
Both felt       strongly that the 50th anniversary of this influential gathering of       writers should be marked publicly       and its significance brought to wider attention.
Nick Barley, EIBF       Director, received their proposals       with enthusiasm and the first of a series of meetings took place in June       2010, during which Bartie       and Bell discussed their research findings with Barley.
Bartie highlighted       how much the debates at       the 1962 Conference provided insights into broader culture and society,       emphasised its importance       to the history of the arts in Scotland, and provided copies of her       published outputs on the research       as well as copies of original archival materials on the original 1962       Conference (including a copy of       the transcript of the 1962 Conference discussions).
Barley was excited by       how the 1962       Conference had so effectively `taken the pulse' of 1960s society and how       crucial the format had       been to its success.
Bartie's publications were drawn on to shape plans       for the 2012 events, and       both Bartie and Bell were invited to act as academic advisers to the EIBF.
An ambitious five-day       series of debates that would `conceptually echo' the original five themes       of the 1962 Conference       was discussed as a central strand of the 2012 EIBF, and Bartie and Bell       were invited to act as       `strand curators', and to assist with shaping and contextualizing these       events.
In July 2011, Barley announced that Bartie's and Bell's research had       inspired an extension of the       original plans, in which the five days at the EIBF in 2012 would be the       beginning of a full year of       events modelled on the 1962 Conference, the Edinburgh World Writers       Conference, staged at the       EIBF's World Alliance partner festivals around the world.
Description of the Impact:     1.
Enhancements to the EIBF and the introduction of a World Writer's         Conference     Bartie's and Bell's research was directly responsible for the decision by       the EIBF to establish the       2012-2013 Edinburgh World Writers' Conference (EWWC), and for shaping the       launch events at       EIBF 2012.
It framed the key themes and questions debated during EWWC,       with Bartie providing       information on the broader debates covered in 1962 alongside their       historical significance, and       provided a point of reference for assessing the role of literature today,       and for reflecting upon its       contemporary relevance (Sources 1, 3, 4, and 5).
Without Bartie's and       Bell's research, EWWC       2012-13 would not have been conceived, and without it the numerous       economic and social       impacts that have accrued would not have occurred.
Bartie's and Bell's       research also underpinned       a major bid submitted by the EIBF to the Scottish Government Expo Fund;       they contributed to the       application, with their work on examining the themes discussed in 1962       proving foundational for       the successful application (&#163;260k secured).
As Nick Barley reflected in       the application, "The       themes of 1962 remain just as relevant fifty years on and so, with the       words sharpened and refined       for the 21st century, the sessions in 2012 will be focused on exactly the       same ideas" (Nick Barley,       Expo Fund Application, August 2011).
This led to a partnership between the EIBF and the British Council, which       matched the funding       from the Expo Fund (&#163;266k funding plus &#163;34k in-kind support), extending       the reach and       significance of the 2012-13 Edinburgh World Writers' Conference (EWWC) to       a total of 15       countries around the world, each of which were to organise a five-day       debate conceptually echoing       the 1962 Conference.
EIBF secured &#163;186,500 from international literary       Festival partners, and the       Edinburgh event was also included in the 2012 London Cultural Olympiad       (Sources 1 and 2).
Bartie and Bell actively worked as academic advisers throughout the       conception, development,       preparations and presentation of EWWC.
As well as advising on the 1962       Conference to shape the       content and format of the 2012-13 events, they provided both EIBF and the       British Council with       detailed summaries of the 1962 Conference themes and debate highlights       drawn from their       research, which were then used for website publicity, promotional       materials, and as the       centrepiece in the official 2012-13 EWWC programme distributed to all       audience members (3000       copies) (Sources 1, 2, 4 and 5).
EWWC 2012-13 was the central strand of       EIBF 2012, and EWWC       events also took place in Toronto, Berlin, Cape Town, Krasnoyarsk, Jaipur,       Beijing, Congo-Brazza,       Brussels, St Malo, Lisbon, Izmir, Trinidad/Tobago and Kuala Lumpur (as       well as Melbourne in       August 2013).

Influence on writers     50 writers from different parts of the world and at different stages in       their careers were invited to       participate in the first EWWC event in Edinburgh in August 2012.
An       additional 262 international       writers representing 61 countries have since taken part in 13 of the       events around the world, with       11 of the Scottish writers and 9 others who took part in Edinburgh also       participating (Sources 1 and       2).
Bartie and Bell also compiled a delegate pack for the 50 invited       writers at the Edinburgh event,       which was used throughout the course of the debates, with numerous       references to what writers       taking part in 1962 had said on the corresponding days of the original       conference (Source 4); this       was also used in the Cape Town delegate packs.
These EWWC events have       increased       communication and debate between writers of many different nations and       cultures (Sources 1 and       6).
Crime writer Denise Mina recently blogged about the importance of EWWC       2012-13 in       establishing a sense of community amongst writers and opening up channels       of communication,       resulting in a number of significant outcomes &#8212; including the production       of a collaborative       statement on writers' rights and challenges in relation to copyright and       e-book distribution (Source       8).
The EWWC has (and continues to) influence how writers think and       discuss their work, precisely       because of the five-day multiple writer format inspired by the 1962       conference (Sources 6 and 9).

Influence on media and public understanding     Nick Barley refers to EWWC in the introduction to the 2012 Annual Review       as `One of the most       talked-about projects of the year' (Source 7).
EWWC has reached audiences       directly at the events       (5071 audience members across 8 editions of EWWC, based on available       figures) and online via       the live-streaming of events, blogging, tweeting and other forms of       communication (33,584 visits to       the website from 166 different countries in the period 1 July 2012 to 24       June 2013; Twitter hashtag       #worldwritersconf had a reach of 439,698 accounts with 886,236 impressions       at the highest point       so far; and EWWC currently has 2123 actively engaged followers) (Source       1).
The historical       materials Bartie and Bell wrote for the EWWC website stimulated media       interest in the original       1962 International Writers' Conference (including articles in The         Guardian and TLS).
Bartie and       Bell were interviewed for The Scotsman, BBC Scotland (web), and       BBC Radio 4 Today       (transmitted 21/08/12); Bartie also appeared live on STV Scotland         Tonight (15/12/2012).
The       EWWC has received 267 media mentions around the world so far (Source 1).

Economic benefits     The EIBF has benefitted from the addition of the Edinburgh World Writer's       Conference, noting in its       2012 Annual Review that it attracted a `record number of visitors' and a       3% increase in ticket sales       on 2011, despite the economic downturn (Source 7).
It secured &#163;712,500 of       additional funding       (and &#163;34,000 in-kind support).
Five new temporary posts were created in       Edinburgh &#8212; a Writers'       Conference Coordinator (20-month freelance contract), Writers' Conference       Editor (12 month       freelance contract), Writers' Conference Assistants (6 day contract for       two people), and a Social       Media Consultant (5 day contract).
A commission was also put out for an       artist to produce a piece       of work in response to EWWC.
In partnership with EIBF, the British Council       has helped to       coordinate the 15 events around the world, employing the PR company Four       Coleman Getty to       undertake publicity for EWWC.
Two new temporary jobs were also created at       the British Council: a       9-month 0.6 FTE freelance project manager and a 9-month 0.4 FTE freelance       web manager       (Source 2).
Furthermore, the photographic images uncovered as part of       Bartie's and Bell's       research were used for online and print promotion and publicity, as well       as during EWWC events.
Bartie and Bell were also invited and appeared on day one of EWWC       alongside surviving 1962       Conference organisers, John Calder and Jim Haynes, at which they launched       their book on the       legacy of 1962 [4].
Overall, the EWWC has been significant in a number of ways.
As a high       profile partnership       between EIBF and the British Council, supported by The Scottish       Government's Edinburgh       Festivals Expo Fund, Creative Scotland, the City of Edinburgh Council, and       Event Scotland, it has       increased awareness of the 1962 International Writers' Conference, with       references to its historical       significance appearing on EWWC 2012-13 related materials.
Furthermore, as       Barley points out, it       has `underlined Scotland's status as a major player in global literary       culture' (Source 1).
The       centrality of EWWC 2012-13 to the partner book festivals around the world       has given Edinburgh       and Scotland worldwide publicity.
