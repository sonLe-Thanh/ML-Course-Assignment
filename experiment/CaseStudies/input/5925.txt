     4.1 Mandatory wage floors in the national labour market &#8212; the National         Minimum Wage       The Low Pay Commission (LPC) is an independent statutory non-departmental       public body set up       under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998.
The LPC remit is "to recommend       levels [to       Government] for the minimum wage rates that help as many low-paid workers       as possible without       any significant adverse impact on employment or the economy.
The advice       ... will be based on the       best available evidence."
The LPC has an annual round of tendering for       research projects with       follow-up research workshops which inform their annual report.
The       research impact has been to       provide a sustained and significant contribution to the LPC's annual       recommendations to       government, and identifiably so within the 2008-2013 REF2014 impact period       (see sources {1}-{5}       and Factual Statement 1).
Findings have informed and influenced the LPC       which by extension has       contributed to the setting of the UK national minimum wage rates affecting       in the order of 800,000-1       million UK jobs per annum or 4.2 per cent of jobs in the UK economy over       the 2008-2013 period.
The series of commissioned research projects since 2000 (and three since       2008), and the direct       presentations of these findings to the LPC (via annual research workshops       in 2008, 2009 and       2011) demonstrates the on-going engagement between Swaffield and the LPC:     "We place great importance on making evidence-based recommendations.
Our evidence base         consists of in-house analysis, commissioned research and independent         research.
....
Professor         Joanna Swaffield has been a valuable contributor to this evidence base         since the establishment of         the Low Pay Commission in 1997."...
"...
Professor Swaffield has made an         important contribution         to the work of the Low Pay Commission and the findings of her research         have influenced the         decisions made by Commissioners in recommending the rates of the         National Minimum Wage."
[Chief Economist and Deputy Secretary Low Pay Commission]     The specific impact claimed in the REF2014 period relates to three key       questions facing the LPC in       their recommendations on the adult and age-related (youth &amp;       development) minimum wage rates:       (1) Whether employment adjustments occur on the `intensive margin'         (working hours)?
The       research findings suggest that, although small in magnitude, there is some       evidence of an       `employment' adjustment in response to the NMW along the `intensive       margin' (i.e.
through working       hours).
This was an interesting result as even though we were unable to       distinguish whether this       was driven by the employee reducing their hours (labour supply) or       employer reducing their labour       demand the finding of an intensive margin adjustment was distinct from       that of the "extensive"       margin.
This result has particular relevance to the LPC remit to "help as       many low-paid workers as       possible" as if working hours decrease (as a result of the NMW) then the       overall earnings effect of       the NMW could be neutral or even negative.
The contribution of the       underpinning research was to       show that there was some effect on the working hours but that this was       small in magnitude:     "... they found some statistically adverse negative effects on hours         over the long-run.
...
However,         the reduction in hours was less than the increase in the minimum wage,         thereby increasing weekly         pay.
These findings were important in convincing Commissioners that the         low paid had not         suffered a reduction in weekly earnings."
"... [this research project on         `working hours'] has had on-going         value to the Commission's evidence base over the period from 2008 to         present (and was         referenced in the 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013 Low Pay Commission reports).
As well as         establishing a methodological basis for future research, it also         provided an important research         finding that subsequent research has investigated and updated for more         recent (recessionary)         periods."
[Chief Economist and Deputy Secretary LPC]     (2) How wage growth for low-wage workers would evolve without annual         or `real' NMW upratings?
The research findings suggest that low-wage employers are being regulated       in their wage       increases by the government's setting of the NMW (thereby highlighting the       importance of the LPC       recommendations for `real' NMW upratings to low-wage workers).
This       informed the four LPC       Reports over 2009-2012: "Professor Swaffield built on her previous         research to look at the impact         of the minimum wage on the wage growth of low-paid employees.
She found         that, when the         minimum wage increases were above average earnings, wage growth was         raised above what it         would have been without a minimum wage.
However, when the minimum wage         increase was         smaller, employers managed to hold down wages and wage growth was less         than it would have         been in the absence of a minimum wage.
She concluded that her results         were consistent with the         minimum wage regulating the annual wage growth afforded to low-paid         workers.
This has been a         useful insight to Commissioners."
[Chief Economist and Deputy Secretary         LPC]     (3) Do minimum wages reduce staying-on rates at school/education?
The research findings       suggest that: (1) young people's education and employment decisions had       not been significantly       affected by the extension (in October 2004 and the large increase in       October 2006) of the       minimum wage rates to youth workers, which is as we would expect if       primary drivers behind the       decision to leave school are not local labour market wages and we       concluded that future changes       (of similar size) in the minimum wage were unlikely to significantly       affect young people's main       choice between education and employment; and (2) the reduction in the age       of entitlement to the       adult NMW rate, from 22 to 21 in October 2010 had not distorted the       education or labour market       choices of this group (compared to 20 year olds).
This informed the LPC       Reports 2010 &amp; 2012:       "This [first] finding, along with other research and evidence, gave         confidence to Commissioners         that they had set the 16-17 Year Old Rate appropriately."
... "[on the         second finding] This evidence         was an important counterweight to the other analysis that had shown more         adverse effects of the         NMW on young people."
[Chief Economist and Deputy Secretary LPC]     4.2 Informing minimum wage and living wage policy debates beyond the         LPC (2008-2013)       The underpinning research has been disseminated widely via the Royal       Economic Society's       Annual Conference 2009 Special Session: "Ten Years of the National Minimum       Wage", the       European Association of Labour Economists (EALE) 2008 and the Work,       Pensions and Labour       Economics Study Group (WPEG) conference 2008 &amp; 2011 (WPEG is sponsored       by the       Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and attended by a number of key       civil servants in the       DWP and related government departments), and the reach of the research       beyond the UK is       evidenced by citations in international non-academic/government reports       (see sources {6}, {7} &amp;       {8}).
Recent presentations such as at the `Fairness at Work in Challenging       Times' Conference       (Manchester Business School, September 2012) which had non-academic       participants and       speakers from unions and local government, and as an invited speaker at       the UNISON Local       Government Service Group Executive Policy Workshop (an audience of about       50 elected and       official UNISON representatives across the 11 regions, November 2012) has       brought the research       on the `intensive margin' and wage growth to a wider audience, and as part       of the Living Wage       debate.
The relevance of the underpinning research to the current Living       Wage debate is       evidenced by citations in the recent Living Wage (and related) policy       literature (see sources {9},       {10} &amp; {11}) and by Swaffield acting as the academic peer reviewer of       the Welsh Assembly       Government's Living Wage commissioned research project (Stage 1 2010 &amp;       Stage 2 2012).
4.3 Voluntary wage floors in local labour markets &#8212; the Living Wage         (LW)       Professor Swaffield's underpinning research supported engagement and       impact at the local level       via CYC and JRF/JRHT.
Swaffield's CYC commissioned report discussing wage       growth/spillovers       within CYC's internal wage distribution, potential intensive margin       adjustments and other       considerations [Swaffield JK (2012) "City of York Council and the Living       Wage: Issues for       consideration in adopting a Living Wage Policy", February, Report to City       of York Council]       supported through the University of York's Strategic Initiative Fund (SIF)       &#163;2,300 September 2011-       July 2012, directly informed CYC's proposal for the implementation of the       Living Wage Supplement       in April 2013.
A wage policy that has affected slightly more than 7% of       the workforce of the largest       employer in York.
This impact and engagement was supported through       meetings at CYC in 2012       with the Chief Executive and her senior team and a Cabinet Briefing on 27th       March 2012:     "...[Swaffield's] work in relation to our preparation and final         decisions, into adopting the Living         Wage, initially as a non contractual supplement, have directly         benefitted over 500 staff within the         workforces of the council and York Schools from April 2013"     [Chief Executive, City of York Council]       Engagement with JRF/JRHT Directors (June 20th 2012 and       subsequent meetings) lead to       Swaffield and University of York colleagues (Professor Tunstall, Dr Rugg       &amp; Professor Bradshaw)       being commissioned to undertake a "Pre Living Wage Survey" of the       household resources, working       time, and time constraints/preferences of a sample of JRF/JRHT staff that       were to be directly       affected by the LW implementation in January 2013 (about 100 or 10% of the       JRF/JRHT       workforce).
The preliminary research report was submitted to JRF/JRHT in       June 2013:     "...The Pre Living Wage Survey has already proved useful to our         organisation in implementing the         Living Wage policy.
...
It also helped to confirm the executive's         understanding of the significance to         the lowest and low paid staff of a major Pay and Benefits Review which         had been the first step in         our journey as an employer to implementing the Living Wage for all our         staff" [Director of Policy         and Research, JRF and Director of Central Services, JRF/JRHT].
