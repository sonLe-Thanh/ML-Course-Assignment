     In 2008, B-3M was incorporated into the statutory Early Years Foundation       Stage (EYFS).
The research thus influenced secondary legislation, and       impacted upon all registered early years providers and practitioners in       England, and the children in their care.
This phase (2008-12) of uptake of       B-3M represents the culmination of a policy trend that the original       research had inaugurated, toward high quality educare for the under fives.
Communicating Matters (CM) has continued to influence CPD.
Local       CM training was recommended in the National         Strategies EY Inclusion Development Programme (2008, p19), and its       policy significance was cited in support of `communication friendly       museums' by a Nesta-funded         consortium (2009).
The CM programme was still being offered in       period by Local Authorities including Lincolnshire       (2008-9); Central         Bedfordshire (2011); Plymouth       (2013-14); Sure         Start St. Helens (2008-9) (indicative list).
Following Abbott's early lead, the research team continued to contribute       to the development of professional standards and a graduate workforce.
Under Barron's leadership MMU was selected by the Children's Workforce       Development Council (CWDC) in 2011 as main provider in the North of       England of Early Years Professional Status accreditation and leads the       Early Years Professional Northern Alliance, a consortium of nine       providers.
EYPS is recognised as having `significantly improved quality' (Nutbrown         Review 2012, 8).
Jones served on the Scientific Advisory Board for       the CWDC/University of Wolverhampton Longitudinal Study on Early Years       Professional (EYP).
B-3M is not explicitly referenced in the latest iteration of EYFS (1 Sep       2012).
Nevertheless, its holistic, child-centred ethos is still evident in       its three `prime areas' of communication and language, physical, and       personal, social and emotional development, described as `particularly       crucial for igniting children's curiosity and enthusiasm for learning, and       for building their capacity to learn, form relationships and thrive' (DfE       2012, 1.4).
The key tenets of B-3M have entered the language and the         architecture of English EY policy to a point where they no longer         require specific citation.
Moreover the B-3M training materials (booklet, cards and poster) are       still being disseminated, testifying to their continuing significance.
The       EYFS-endorsed website, Foundation         Years has made them available for download stating that they       `contain useful information relevant to the reformed (2012) EYFS', and the       materials are also accessible via LA websites including Hampshire,       Leicester,       Oxfordshire,       Dorset and       Somerset;       the Parents         In Touch website, and Nursery           World magazine (11.06.2012).
The ESRC and AHRC research has impacted on professional practice,       stimulated practitioner debate and challenged conventional wisdom about       children and childhood.
The Becoming a Problem (BAP) report       attracted media coverage in September 2009, including: Telegraph,         Sunday Telegraph, Observer, Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday, Independent on         Sunday, Sunrise (Australian TV), The Week With George Galloway       (Jones, radio interview), and blogs (UK, Ethiopa, Japan, Denmark,       Indonesia and India).
It was cited in the Policy.co.uk (`Opinion       Formers'), Social Policy Digest, ResearchGate (Berlin) and Wellbeing       Australia.
The BAP research identified barriers to change from cultural assumptions       about young children, and generated a prototype film as an alternative to       more traditional research-based CPD materials.
ESRC         Follow-On funding was awarded to maximise the impact of the film by       developing a cross-professional         educational package in collaboration with users from constituencies       including LA Children's Services, GTC, educational psychology, journalism,       CAMHS services, social work, psychotherapy, educational psychology, parent       groups, EY trainees and practitioners, school staff and students.
The research has been taken up in ITT, CPD and cross-professional       education in the UK and overseas; eg: 2 multi-professional seminars,       Sheffield Unversity (7.30,2012; 12.07.13); workshops and presentations:       Chester University (2011), University of the West of England (2012),       Staffordshire County Council EYP National Conference (2012); Oslo and       Akershus University College, Norway (2012, 2013), Universities of Helsinki       and Oulu (2012), Organization Mondiale pour l'Education Prescholaire,       University of Canterbury, NZ (2011); Summer School on the Rights of the       Child, Ministry of Justice, Rome (June, 2012).
User         responses to the film package testify to its strong impact and value       for training; eg: "I could see your film being part of cross-professional       training.
I think teachers would see it very differently to how we've       viewed it" (CAMHS team psychologist).
"I think the film has huge potential       across children's services, social workers, early years practitioners in       children's centres, youth workers" (LA Director of Children's Services).
"It'd be a great training tool...
I'd love to use it in one of my       sessions" (Teacher Educator).
"I have thought a lot about your film and       its purpose to promote alternative conceptualisations of children &#8212;       without being too directive.
I think that this is a real issue in our       society and much needed" (Education Consultant/Educational Psychologist).
International impact on teacher education: the ESRC and AHRC research has       been evaluated and used by educators including D. Britzman, Ontario; A.       Palmer &amp; H. Lenz-Taguchi, Stockholm; A.M. Otterstad, N. Rossholt,       Oslo; S. Grieshaber, Hong Kong; J. Sumsion, &amp; J. Reid, Deakin, Aus.
From the widely-used and appreciated B-3M and CM packs to the BAP film,       the materials generated during the research, and their uptake by diverse       communities, exemplify the transformative potential of cultural artefacts       and resources that creatively encapsulate high quality research.
These       materials have been significant in scaffolding multi-professional and       interdisciplinary engagement with young children and their education.
Interdisciplinary and multi-professional impact has been sharpened       through spin-off activities involving artists and professionals.
Holmes'         ESRC Seminar Series (2010-12) brought together museum curators,       policy makers, artists, teachers, teacher educators, school students and       academics from sociology, cultural studies and art and design.
