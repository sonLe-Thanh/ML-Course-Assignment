     Aviva is a British multinational insurance company, the largest in       the UK and the sixth largest in the world, as measured by net premium       income, and has around 43 million customers in 21 countries.
It is the       market leader in both general and life insurance in the UK, and in 2012,       had around 15% market share in general insurance, 25% market share in       individual pension annuities, and 15% market share in life/critical       illness term assurance.
Our work on data mining and statistical analysis       has been applied to two specific areas of Aviva business, the       general insurance market and the pensions annuity market, to provide       considerably better products for Aviva customers.
General Insurance     Aviva uses our research into meta-heuristic techniques and data       mining for both pricing and marketing in general insurance (e.g.
car and       household).
This is of direct benefit to general insurance customers,       because adoption of these techniques allows a more competitively priced       product to be offered to customers, whilst still maintaining Aviva's       profitability.
In particular, data mining techniques have been applied to       Aviva's Personal Lines Pricing.
Insurance premiums are calculated       using scoring derived from the applicant's attributes and history: for       instance, for car-insurance, these might be gender, age, car-model,       accident history etc.
We developed methods of scoring these factors that       enabled Aviva to refine their risk cost and behavioural modelling       and hence to increase the competitiveness of their quotations.
Data mining       techniques are also used in the development and implementation of       predictive models for targeted marketing campaigns.
This has materially       improved Aviva's marketing and pricing capability, as indicated       below in a statement by the Managing Director, At Retirement, Aviva           UK Life Ltd.:     `UEA's research in data-mining has been integral in changing the way         in which Aviva prices general insurance products.
It is also used         in our predictive models for targeted marketing campaigns.
Insurance is         a very competitive industry and correct pricing and marketing are core         to our survival.
It's difficult to quantify the exact savings that UEA's         input has made to Aviva, but it would certainly run into many         millions.'
(taken from corroborating source A)     The use of these techniques within the company is greatly enhanced by our       training of Aviva data-analysts via an in-house MSc developed by       the School specifically for Aviva and which has already been       attended by over 100 Aviva staff.
Annuities     An annuity provides an individual with a regular income for remaining       life in exchange for a lump sum, typically accumulated through a personal       pension.
Life expectancy is a key determinant of the regular income that       can be purchased with a given lump sum.
"Enhanced (impaired lives)       annuities" provide more income for a given lump sum for individuals known       to have conditions that shorten their life expectancy and are a growing       area of business for Aviva.
Until recently, all the risk analysis       and hence pricing of enhanced annuities were out-sourced to secondary       re-insurance companies, resulting in a `black box' approach to the       products on offer, so that a quote for an annuitant was offered without Aviva       control or contribution.
Based on the UEA research in meta-analysis, a       joint UEA and Aviva team under the leadership of Kulinskaya has       produced three confidential technical reports that assess the main       insurance risks in the three most prevalent chronic medical conditions       within the annuities market [text removed for publication] enabling it to be       more competitive in this market and to generate a significant increase in       its share of the profit from enhanced annuities.
Underlying this important       business development is a new two-pronged approach to the evidence-based       pricing of enhanced annuities, developed by the UEA/Aviva team:            the use of meta-analysis and evidence-synthesis of the published         studies to assess the effects on longevity of a number of chronic         medical conditions,       a state-of-the-art large-scale longitudinal analysis of primary care         data informed by the obtained evidence-base.
Both steps are being implemented by the joint UEA/Aviva team.
To       date, this has been completed for myocardial infarction and diabetes.
The       UEA contribution is evidenced by the following statement by the Head         of Underwriting, At Retirement, Aviva UK Life Ltd.:     `She [Professor Kulinskaya] has made a significant contribution to our         development and understanding of longevity.
[...] Professor Kulinskaya's         pioneering work on survival models has provided Aviva with         confidence that these models underpinning our guarantees to customers         are sound and robust'     `The relationship with UEA and Professor Kulinskaya in particular has         helped Aviva avoid consultancy costs that would have amounted to         an estimated &#163;150 000 over the project life.'
`In studying specific conditions affecting longevity we have found the         research input from Professor Kulinskaya to be of a greater quality than         many other agencies offering professional services in this arena.
...         [text removed for publication] It is difficult to quantify what this will be         worth but the market size for medically enhanced annuities is estimated         at &#163;4bn annually with Aviva looking to take at least a 25%         share.... [text removed for publication] The potential benefit could run into         several million pounds.'
