     (i) Transforming curricula, teaching and learning on Sparta in HEIs         worldwide.
The revisionist insights of Hodkinson's research have       transformed teaching and learning on Sparta in HEIs worldwide.
Evidence of       its influence since 2008 has been received from 30 HEIs (5.1).
These span       14 countries from the UK to China and six continents, especially Europe,       Australasia and above all North America, including Ivy League institutions       (Cornell; Dartmouth; Princeton); public universities (e.g.
Berkeley;       Calgary; Rutgers); and liberal arts colleges (Reed).
To quote one       Princeton academic, "the work of no other scholar, living or dead,       has had a greater impact on the research of my students... or on my         ability to teach these two courses [in 2008 &amp; 2012]".
This influence stems from Hodkinson's own writings and his edited books       (3.4-3.6), which "provide in depth study for my students beyond any       single-authored book" (Emory).
"Their examination of wider themes means       their implications extend beyond teaching on Sparta alone" (Napoli II).
Several academics stated how the research had influenced the form and         content of curricula: "Hodkinson's work had a profound influence on       the content and design of that course" (Dartmouth); "Hodkinson's recent       work informed not only much of the teaching, but also the redesign of the       course" (Winnipeg); "in devising this course, I had Prof. Hodkinson's       research directly in mind" (Adelaide).
The debate on Spartan         exceptionalism in 3.4 has had an especially major impact: "Sparta:         Comparative Approaches (2009) enabled me to create a new overarching       framework for the course" (Calgary); "Hodkinson's work was particularly       influential in the course design, including the title [Sparta: An       Extraordinary City] drawn from Hodkinson 2009" (Lampeter).
Similar       comments were received from HEI teachers at Adelaide, Berkeley, Dartmouth,       Princeton and Winnipeg.
Several testimonies highlighted major influences on student learning:       "my students have been strongly influenced by his research" (Reed); "you       had a profound impact on the class" (Princeton).
A PhD student at Warsaw       described how during his UG studies Hodkinson's research had "had a deep       influence... for direction of my academic development".
A current MA       student at Rio wrote: "Your work is a reference for me and my academical       experience."
A former MA student (2009) at Kwazulu-Natal commented on "the       methodological paradigms it provides".
At Nanjing the impact extended       beyond the curriculum: "Between 2010 and 2012 some students... formed a       voluntary study group, where they read Hodkinson's 2006 paper and       discussed wider problems such as the criteria for a military society [and]       comparisons between Spartan and modern Japanese militarism".
One result has been greater numbers studying Sparta.
At Adelaide,       from 29 in 2006, "the new Hodkinson-inspired course had 51 students in       2008, and 88 in 2010".
At Lampeter numbers rose annually from 15 in       2009/10 to 94 in 2012/13; at Winnipeg from 47 in 2010/11 to 63 in 2012/13.
(ii) Enriching UK secondary teaching and learning, and inspiring         pupils' aspirations.
Hodkinson's research engagement with schools has enriched secondary       teaching and learning, inspiring pupils' educational ambitions.
Initially,       this took place through talks on Sparta's modern receptions (cf.
3.5-6) at       the East Midlands Association of Classical Teachers 6th form days and an       article in the national schools magazine Omnibus 52, 2006.
For         one pupil, his Feb 2008 EMACT talk on `Spartan Militarism in 20th-century         International Politics' proved a career-changing event.
In 2011,       when inviting Hodkinson to give the inaugural lecture of Clare College       Cambridge's History Society, he recalled, "It still ranks among the best I       have ever attended...
I remember leaving filled with ideas about why I       should study History" (5.2).
After Cambridge, the student went on to PG       study of international politics in 2012/13 through an MA in International       Relations at Yale.
Recently Hodkinson used his research on ancient Sparta (3.1-4) to assist       schools taking OCR's AS &amp; GCSE Sparta options (units AH1 &amp; A353).
In September 2012 he spoke on "New Approaches to Classical Sparta" to 50       teachers at the Joint Association of Classical Teachers INSET day.
Several         testified to the talk's major influence on their teaching (5.3).
It       "was centrally important to the approach I took" (modern history       re-trainee, Grey Coat Hospital, London); "as an NQT,... this has       influenced how I approach my teaching" (Simon Langton Girls' Grammar,       Canterbury); "I had more insight when discussing historical viewpoints of       Sparta with my own students" (OCR exam marker, Queen Mary's College,       Basingstoke).
"Hodkinson's talk and publications... have given me greater       confidence in questioning the nature of evidence presented in standard       textbooks" (Bancroft's School, Essex).
The talk's impact led JACT's Journal         of Classics Teaching to solicit its publication in JCT's       Spring 2013 issue "as an effective way to improve teacher subject       knowledge" (5.4).
During 2012/13 Hodkinson then liaised with teachers to give follow-up       research-led talks at several schools (state, grammar, independent &amp; 6th       form college).
His talks greatly enhanced the pupils' performances and         raised their aspirations.
"The materials... helped the students to       perform strongly on this unit" (Leicester Grammar School).
"[The talk]       clearly moved the students' analytical development forward... the speech       had a profound and very positive impact" (QMC).
At Grey Coat, an inner       London girls' comprehensive, teaching Ancient History for the first time,       "the talk ... significantly improved pupils' understanding of how to       approach the study of Sparta".
"The AS results [were] significantly above       the school average" and pupils "did better on the Sparta paper" than on       other modules "with an average of 77% &#8212; high B grade".
"A large       majority... have continued... on to A2 and there are two who are planning       on applying to university to study the subject" (5.3).
(iii) Influencing and enhancing cultural heritage policies in the         modern city of Sparti.
Hodkinson's account of a civic-oriented, less       militaristic and less exceptional Sparta (3.3-4) has altered the         Municipality of Sparti's depictions of its ancient legacy.
According       to the Mayor of Sparti (5.5), his "publications over the last 10 years       have changed how the Municipality presents its cultural heritage from       ancient Sparta... His research has led the Municipality to present ancient       Sparta as a civic-minded culture with important lessons to offer Greece in       its current situation."
These new understandings have been communicated by engaging with local       government agencies (Office of the Mayor; Department of Culture, Sports       &amp; Environment; Central Public Library) through Nottingham's Centre for       Spartan and Peloponnesian Studies (CSPS), of which Hodkinson is       co-director.
He has also disseminated his research in the city through       personal lectures (April 2005; June 2006; April 2009; Sept 2010; March       2012) in Greek and English to audiences including local officials,       teachers and the wider public (5.5); and by donations of his publications,       academic and popular, to the Library's local history collection, much-used       by local teachers and students (5.6).
He has also helped the Municipality fulfil the cultural heritage         policy objectives in its current business plan: (a) enhancement of       the local cultural heritage; (b) the quantitative and qualitative       improvement of its cultural services; (c) an increase in visitors (5.7).
This has been achieved by linking his research dissemination to public       international conferences co-organised by CSPS with the Municipality and       held in the Central Public Library.
Statements by the Mayor &amp; Library       Director attest how these research events have greatly assisted local       cultural heritage policies: enhancing public understanding of the city's       ancient past, providing an important new cultural service, bringing in       Greek and foreign visitors, and extending the Library's cultural and       educational outreach (5.5-6).
CSPS's research activities are now embedded       in the Municipality's 2012-14 Business Plan, whose action points include       further joint conferences supported by &#8364;5K annual funding (5.7).
Finally, Hodkinson's publications and international research       collaborations have greatly aided the Municipality's promotion of the         city in Greece and abroad.
His contributions were recognised in 2010       by the award of Honorary Citizenship.
According to the award citation,       "his scholarly research has made the history of ancient Sparta and Lakonia       known throughout the world" (5.8).
(iv) Responding to 300: enabling authenticity in         comics writing via historical consultancy.
Nottingham research has enabled a comics author to achieve a more       authentic fictional portrayal of Spartan society in the comics series, Three       (Image Comics, Oct. 2013-Feb. 2014): a story of three helots set during       Sparta's 4th-century crisis.
In the author's own words (5.10),         "without recent Nottingham research, THREE would have been a different         and much poorer work".
Three was written as a response to Frank Miller's graphic novel       and Zack Snyder's film 300.
The author's initial research was       influenced by Fotheringham's paper (3.6) and podcasts on Miller's 300       (www.nottingham.ac.uk/videos/2008/march/bloodandthunderpart1.aspx) and by       Hodkinson's paper on helotage (3.1).
On Fotheringham's advice, he asked       Hodkinson to act as consultant.
From July 2012 to July 2013 Hodkinson       supplied in-depth `authenticity critiques' throughout the production of       both text and images, drawing on his research on helotage, Spartiate       military and civic culture, and female roles (3.1-3).
The author also       visited Nottingham to consult other Classics and CSPS staff.
The author's published interviews and factual statement (5.9-10) stress the         depth of Hodkinson's influence.
"Some of it was purely factual...       Other areas were larger and more conceptual, with him bringing something       from his original work which added to what I was already exploring.
There's a section about a particularly rich Spartan mother... which was       distinctly aided from that."
"I had high hopes for the Three project.
They       would undoubtedly been dashed without Stephen's assistance."
In particular, Hodkinson's input helped the author to counter-balance       300's over-glorification of the Spartiates and neglect of         their exploitation of the helots, thereby enabling the author to draw         out modern socio-political connections.
"His help makes both       Spartans and helots... truer to our best knowledge of them and... more       resonant with how we perceive class today" (5.10).
The ground-breaking impact of the consultancy is shown (5.11) by       Hodkinson's unprecedented naming in pre-release `solicits' (noted by       comics news sites and prospective readers: "the first time I've ever seen       a historical consultant accredited in a comic book": `King's_Gambit',       07.13.13) and by the credits to Hodkinson, Fotheringham and the Department       of Classics in the comic's prelims.
(v) Countering Sparta's (mis)appropriation in U.S. gun control         debates.
Hodkinson's research (3.3) has helped improve the quality of evidence in       U.S. gun control debates, enabling an activist to counter Sparta's         appropriation by the pro-gun lobby.
In May 2013, the activist, aware       of Sparta in Modern Thought (3.6), asked whether the gun lobby's       use of Leonidas' saying "Molon labe" as a rallying-cry against gun control       matched the reality of Sparta's policy on bearing arms.
Hodkinson supplied       a detailed `academic opinion' that the Spartiates normally went unarmed in       everyday life and that the "Molon labe" saying was of dubious historical       authenticity.
On 9 June 2013 the activist posted Hodkinson's academic opinion on the Ceasefire         Oregon, New Trajectory blog, followed by his own       interpretative post, in which he was able to argue that the academic         opinion showed that historical Spartan practice formed a poor precedent         for and even undermined gun lobby arguments (5.12).
By 16 July 2013       the posts had over 1600 direct hits and the blog site as a whole had a       much higher than normal hit rate in the week of posting.
The posts were       also advertised in the online newsletter of States United to Prevent         Gun Violence.
Many of the direct hits came via The Gun Wire       news clearing-house, much-read by the gun lobby.
Explicit gun lobby       discussion has not been traceable, owing to their practice of hiding       discussions of awkward evidence from public view: silent testimony perhaps       to the posts' effectiveness (5.13).
