     Working with Chawton House Library (CHL), Clery and Dow have actively       engaged with intense       public interest in the works of Austen.
They have brought the importance       of a wide group of 18th-century       women writers to the attention of teachers, students, TV and filmmakers,       and to the       officers and members of international historical and literary societies.
As a result, work at the       University of Southampton has made a distinct contribution to public       education and understanding       of 18th-century women's writing, providing publishers and       institutions with significant economic       benefit.
In February 2012 Dow was appointed Director of Research at CHL.
As       Director, she plays the key       role in designing CHL's public programme of evening lectures, exhibitions,       events, and       conferences, drawing on the research strengths of colleagues in the       interdisciplinary Southampton       Centre for Eighteenth-Century Studies, based in the Faculty of Humanities.
E.g.
In Feb. 2013, 80       enthusiastic Austen readers enjoyed a varied evening of research-led talks       by contributors to       Dow's collection Uses of Austen [3.5] celebrating the 200th       anniversary of the publication of Pride         and Prejudice [5.1].
Public exhibitions curated by Dow and drawing       directly from her research into       Austen's letters and novels include the touring show Jane Austen's         Reading (Chawton 2009;       Godmersham Park 2010; Denver, Colorado 2013).
This attracted in excess of       600 visitors across       the 3 venues [5.2].
Dow has also played a key part in organising CHL's       Austen-themed school       visits for over 800 primary and secondary students and their teachers       every year.
Further Public Engagement includes contributions to The British Library's       Jane Austen and         Performance conference for 140 A-level students and teachers (21       June 2010).
Dow's lecture       `Jane Austen and Plays for Young People' drew on her research to tell how       Austen's reading of       Genlis's work contributed to her own novels, notably Mansfield Park.
Feedback from participants       included `the whole day was informative, interesting, and inspiring'       [5.3].
Clery has had repeat invitations to lecture to A-level teachers at       continuing professional       development events organised by Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations       (OCR; July 2011;       Nov. 2012).
Clery's lecture on Mary Shelley and Frankenstein used her       insights about the       economics of publishing&#8212;particularly the success of eighteenth-century       teenage female authors in       the Gothic genre&#8212;to offer teachers a new way of engaging students.
Evidencing teacher       feedback, OCR wrote `...your talk was often felt to be the best part of       the day' [5.4].
As part of our strategy to combine research insights with creative       writing, novelist Rebecca Smith       (Fellow in Creative Writing at Southampton since 2008) published Miss         Jane Austen's Guide to         Modern Life's Dilemmas (2012).
This popular self-help book drew on       Dow's and Clery's research       into Austen's novels, letters, and unpublished writings to supply advice       to young 21st-century       women.
The book includes advice on: managing a budget; how to become       independent; and       balancing the competing demands of family and career.
In the year       following publication, it has       sold over 18,000 copies in the UK (RRP &#163;12.99), and internationally,       bringing economic benefit to       Ivy Press and Tarcher Penguin [5.5].
As Arts Council- and National       Lottery-funded Writer in       Residence at Jane Austen's House Museum, Chawton, Smith has delivered more       than 40       workshops to young people and the general public on themes including the       business of writing,       and the economics of life below and above stairs in Austen's England.
Since 2008, more than 4,000 members of the public have attended Clery's       and Dow's research-based       public lectures.
For instance, Clery delivered a talk to an audience of       150 fee-paying       attendees at a conference linked to The National Portrait Gallery       blockbuster exhibition, Brilliant         Women (April, 2008).
Clery showed how the portraits in the       exhibition are part of a contested       process by which women writers can be seen as icons of British       modernisation and social and       economic improvement.
She also lectured at the National Maritime Museum on       'Jane Austen and       London' (April 2013) to 100 members of the public [5.6].
Her other       ticketed public lectures include       international Jane Austen Society (JAS) meetings in Aberdeen (2011) and       London (2007, 2011,       2013).
Dow has also delivered lectures to international fee-paying JAS       audiences in Chicago       (2008, 2011), London (2008), Sydney and Tokyo (2009) and New York (2012).
JAS audiences are       drawn mostly from outside academia.
There was an average attendance at the       above JAS events       of 250, but the New York 2012 meeting attracted over 800 fee-paying       delegates.
The standard fee       is $10 for JAS members and $15 for others [5.7].
Dow's research insights have been made available to the public through:       articles for Public       Broadcasting Service's website to accompany the US premiere of a new TV       version of Emma       (January 2010); Mslexia (Jan-March 2008); Sensibilities,       the journal of JAS Australia (readership       600; 2009-13); her co-editorship of Persuasions (2010), the online       journal of JAS North America       (3,000 hits in 3 months after publication).
Since 2008, Dow has edited The         Female Spectator, a       non-academic publication distributed internationally to 800 Friends and       Members of CHL.
Dow's expertise has been in particular demand in 2013 due to the 200th       anniversary of the       publication of Pride and Prejudice; she has been interviewed by,       among others, the BBC, Meridian       TV, Al Jazeera and The Washington Post.
Clery has contributed       research-based production advice       and interviews to: BBC4's 'How Reading Made Us Modern' (February 2009),       'The Birth of the       British Novel' (February 2011), and, 'How To Be A Lady"' (March 2013)       [5.8].
