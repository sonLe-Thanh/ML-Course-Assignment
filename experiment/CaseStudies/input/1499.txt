     Bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD), a pestivirus infection of cattle, is one of       the most economically damaging viral diseases affecting cattle in the UK,       costing dairy and beef cattle producers up to &#163;61 million per year,       according to Defra estimates.
It is viewed as one of the most costly       diseases affecting the cattle industry worldwide (losses reported at       US$10-80 per head).
Inefficiencies in livestock management additionally       impact upon food security and agricultural greenhouse gas production,       exerting a broader impact on the economy.
The virus is maintained by a small population of animals that become       persistently infected (PI) whilst in the uterus during the early stages of       pregnancy.
PI calves, representing 1% of UK cattle, often die prematurely       with respiratory or enteric disease, or suffer from reproductive disorders       and stunted growth.
The complex pathogenesis of BVD &#8212; elucidated by       Brownlie's group &#8212; has demonstrated that vaccination is not a simple or       complete solution.
The research into persistence of virus, detectable by PCR, after recovery       of acutely infected animals has guided accreditation of cattle health       schemes, for effective herd biosecurity, incorporated into the UK Cattle       Health Certification Standards (CHeCS) [a].
The Executive Director of       CHeCS confirms: "The Rules in the Technical Document cover Accredited         Free; Vaccinated Monitored Free; and Eradication Programmes for BVD.
They detail blood testing and bulk milk testing methods as well as         quarantining requirements.
RVC's research, particularly its work on         persistence of virus, detectable by PCR, after recovery of acutely         infected animals has informed the text that lays out these requirements         for approved schemes &#8212; such as the Herdsure Accreditation programme,         offered by the AHVLA."
[b].The datasheets produced by the Animal       Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, for interpretation of BVD blood       and milk tests reflect this [c].
The Veterinary Investigation Officer       responsible for this at the AHVLA notes: "The data sheets produced by         AHVLA Scientific providing the methodology for performance of the BVD         tests and their interpretation have included additional results from RVC         Research.
[...] RVC Research found that the period for a PCR positive         result in acute infection could extend for up to 80 days.
In any control         or eradication scheme, persistently infected animals need to be         identified and removed from the herd whilst animals acutely infected         seroconvert and recover and can be retained safely.
The test data sheets         provided by AHVLA highlight the possible potentials for confusion and         emphasise the importance of differentiating between the possible causes         of a positive result.
This is to ensure that infection is managed in the         herd and comply with the requirements of accredited herd health schemes."

RVC's wide-ranging research in this field has informed worldwide       programmes aimed at eradication.
Brownlie's work to identify effective       control interventions through pilot studies in the UK and drawing on the       model programme devised in 2006, has positioned him as the `go-to' adviser       for international governments and organisations committed to BVD       eradication.
After earlier membership of the Scottish Government's       Strategic Science Advisory Panel, he played a leading role in the launch       of Scotland's national BVD eradication programme in 2011, running a series       of master classes, based on his group's findings for hundreds of farmers       and vets.
The President of the National Farmers Union, Scotland, supports       this: "The work of Professor Brownlie's research team has created a         significant part of the veterinary science base on which BVD control         programmes worldwide have been built... they have been key in driving         progress at farm level.
The development of control networks where         expertise has been inbedded [sic] into the programme has provided         real value."

Brownlie sat on the Animal Health Ireland Working       Group to advise on the launch of Ireland's eradication programme in 2009       [f] and travelled to New Zealand and Bangladesh a year later to advise on       their programmes, lecturing farmers and vets.
Between 2008 and 2012, he       gave close to 100 lectures to farmers [g], veterinarians, professional       associations and government organisations worldwide, including in       Australia and Southern African countries.
The lectures are part of a proactive strategy, backed by the RVC, to       disseminate practical findings from research into BVD control globally.
In       2011 Brownlie and Richard Booth (Postdoctoral researcher from 2010 then       Lecturer in Veterinary Extension Services and Infectious Diseases of       Cattle from 2012) contributed to educational webinars produced by IDEXX       Laboratories, the global market leader in diagnostics for animal health,       which featured three one-hour programmes about the virus.
From 260       registrations, 142 individuals, including veterinarians and students, from       nine countries participated live, with feedback averaging 8.7/10.
The       webinars remain available on the IDEXX website [h].
The RVC has developed       a substantial online BVD resource on its website, including podcasts,       videos, presentations, papers and press articles [i].
In 2011, the site       averaged 2,000 hits per month, with downloads up more than 80% on the       previous year, in 2012 this was up to 2,900 per month, with downloads up a       further 40%.
40-50% of the visitors originate in the UK and around 15%       from the US, with over 20 countries making up the remainder [j].
The Swiss mitigation programme is scheduled to run from 2008 to 2017,       with break-even estimated in 2012.
Scotland and Ireland are pressing ahead       with national control programmes, guided by the work to which RVC has       contributed.
Brownlie has campaigned for the introduction of a national BVD       eradication programme for England and Wales, drawing on field research in       East Anglia and the West Country.
Prior to the REF impact period, he       advised BIS on its Foresight Programme on `Detection and Identification of       Infectious Diseases' and, having secured the support of the UK's Chief       Veterinary Officer, he established the National BVD Control Group in order       to lay the foundations for a future national programme.
The UK CVO       confirms the contribution from RVC research: "The research findings and         Professor Brownlie's direct advocacy, informed by this work, have         contributed substantially to the management of this disease, which is a         major global issue for the cattle industry.
Professor Brownlie has been         an indefatigable proponent of the application of BVC control measures in         the field."
[k] In 2008 Brownlie brought the Group under the English       Cattle Health and Welfare Group (ECHWG, now CHAWG) [l], set up to ensure       the delivery of DEFRA's Animal Health and Welfare Strategy to the cattle       sector in England.
The ECHWG immediately made BVD control one of its six       priorities, and this remains an important component of its activities [m].
As part of the UK pilot programmes, Brownlie has sought exposure in       specialist media to raise awareness of BVD among vets and farmers,       together with political and industrial support for the national programme       in England and Wales, through several articles from 2008 to 2012,       including pieces in Farmers Weekly and the Veterinary Times.
This coverage       has contributed to Brownlie receiving an average of two professional       enquiries a week for BVD-related advice [n].
Eradication programmes - as modelled by the Swiss scheme take around 10       years to reach final phases, so full impact is protracted.
However, RVC's       economic analysis of the Swiss programme has shown a substantial margin       over eradication cost is achievable.
Although a UK-wide programme has yet       to be implemented, at both at individual farm and national level (abroad),       uptake of livestock management and disease control measures for BVD,       informed by the RVC's work and active role in dissemination, has already       delivered financial, health and welfare benefits.
