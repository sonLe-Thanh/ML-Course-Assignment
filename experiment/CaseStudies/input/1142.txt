     Our research findings have been disseminated to relevant professionals       via presentations, mind-mindedness training courses, the freely-available       on-line Mind-Mindedness Coding Manual, media appearances and social media       such as Twitter.
Findings from References 1, 2 and 3 above have fed into the NSPCC's All         Babies Count programme and Baby Steps perinatal education       service.
The All Babies Count campaign was launched in November       2011 and has an associated advice booklet that informs parents in simple       terms about mind-mindedness (Source 1 below, pp 4-5).
The NSPCC reported       on the campaign on May 28th 2012 (Source 2 below).
At this       time, the booklet had been viewed over 1500 times online and more       than 10,000 copies had been distributed to parents via healthcare       professionals.
The report stated that:             All Babies Count was Mumsnet's campaign of the week in         January 2012.
All Babies Count was mentioned 6,914 times online, with         5,911 uses of the Twitter hashtag #allbabiescount, reaching an         estimated 800,000 followers.
All Babies Count Facebook tab received 26,950 views.
All Babies Count microsite was visited by 56,979 people,         with 66,137 total visits and a `bounce rate' (i.e., number         leaving the site after viewing only one page) of only 8.4%.
In the launch month, 42% of Westminster MPs stated they were         aware of the campaign, with public support from MPs Ian Duncan-Smith,         Graham Allen and Catherine McKinnell.
Mind-mindedness research is cited and discussed in the practitioners'       manual for the NSPCC's Baby Steps service.
The aim of Baby         Steps is to support vulnerable families in the transition to       parenthood using "a variety of interactive approaches to engage and       support parents, and to help them recognise and respond to their babies'       cues" (Source 3 below, p. 2).
Over 850 parents in England and       Wales have accessed this service since April 2012, with positive early       evaluation results (Source 2 below).
For the past decade, clinical psychologists at the Royal Bethlem Hospital       in London have been using mind-mindedness in their intervention programmes       with depressed mothers and those hospitalised on a residential       mother-and-baby unit (MBU) for a range of severe mental illnesses.
At       present, two clinical psychologists on the MBU are delivering a       mind-mindedness intervention programme designed by Meins.
The intervention       involves filming the mother interacting with her baby and then playing the       filmed interaction to the mother to highlight times when the mother was       being mind-minded and examples of when she was less attuned to her baby's       thoughts and feelings.
Around 500 mothers on the MBU have       benefited from this programme, which has aided recovery and enabled them       to return home with their infants.
A mother who took part in the programme       discussed its importance and effectiveness on Radio 4's All in the         Mind (Source 4 below):     "When we looked back at the video it's the first time that I saw my         reaction to him... and it was the first time actually that I thought,         `Well, how would I feel if I was looking back at that face and hearing         that voice?'
I'd feel a sense of sadness &#8212; that's not the way I need to         communicate with him... Before that, I used to think, `Well, you know,         he's just a baby.'
I didn't think that they had those kind of emotions,         and at the time, I thought, `I'm feeding him, he's clothed and I respond         to him when he cries.'
And if you think, `Well, that's enough, and...         the rest will just fall into place', well it's actually not enough.
And         it's not until you experience the joys of understanding them as a human         being, understanding them as a person and seeing them respond to you;         there's an immense joy from that.
The first time you actually recognise         them responding to you, that's when it all changes and it's beyond just         meeting their practical needs".
Mind-mindedness research has informed the Minding the Baby       intervention programme, which supports high-risk, vulnerable young mothers       through an intensive programme of home visits delivered by a nurse or       social worker.
The aim of Minding the Baby is to make mothers more       aware of their babies' mental states and to voice their babies' emotions       and thoughts (i.e., facilitate mothers' mind-mindedness).
This programme       has been running for a decade in New Haven, USA, and the NSPCC began using       this programme in 2011 in four areas across the UK.
Over a five-year       period, the UK-based programme will provide support for 320 families.
Clinical psychologists in Oxfordshire and The Netherlands have applied       the underpinning research to their programmes for foster carers and       adoptive parents.
Mind-mindedness has been used in this context both to       help inform the intervention (Source 5 below) and to assess the       effectiveness of the intervention programme (Source 6 below).
Recent research in Australia has investigated mind-mindedness in       practitioners working in a child-care centre (Source 7 below).
Higher       levels of mind-mindedness were found to be associated with more sensitive       caregiving and more stimulating play and interaction, but mind-mindedness       was not related to practitioners' level of qualification.
On the basis of       these findings, the authors recommended that mind-mindedness should be       incorporated into child-care workers' education and professional       development.
In follow-up work (Source 8 below), these authors report on a       workshop programme they developed to increase levels of mind-mindedness in       child-care workers.
In the UK, mind-mindedness research has informed       projects such as The Baby Room at Canterbury Christ Church University       which provides support, education and training to childcare professionals       who care specifically for the very youngest children (&lt;18 months) in       daycare.
