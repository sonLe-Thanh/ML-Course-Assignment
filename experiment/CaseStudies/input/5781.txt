     The research described has created a substantial body of evidence and has       influenced public policy and services in several ways.
Geared towards       improving the quality, accessibility and cost-effectiveness of UK health       and education services, the work has advanced policy debate and has had a       major impact on the way hospitals and schools are allocated funding.
The       research has produced impact in four main areas:      &#8226; Review of the Market Forces Factor (MFF)       The first phase of research into the MFF, commissioned in 2005,         recommended six major changes to the MFF formula.
The report was         presented to policy makers within the Department of Health (DoH), the         Technical Advisory Group on Resource Allocation (TAGRA) and ACRA.
The         recommendations were adopted by ACRA and formed part of their 2008         report to the DoH [a] which was implemented in 2009/10.
Recommendations         were geared towards a fairer distribution of funding and for the first         time took part-time NHS workers, as well as those working in the City of         London, into account.
The second phase of the research resulted in         further changes to the formula and to the distribution of funding of         Primary Care Trusts which were recommended to the Secretary of State for         Health in 2010 and implemented from 2011/12 onwards [b] funding totalled         &#163;89 billion for 2011/12.
&#8226; Regional Pay for NHS Medical and Non-Medical Staff       Here, research findings were communicated to the DoH via a written         report and several presentations addressed to policy makers.
The results         of the research formed a central part of the DoH's submissions to the         both the Nursing and other Health Professionals Review Body and         the Doctors and Dentists Review Body (DDRB) in 2006, as well as         the NHS Pay Review Body in 2011 [c,d].
In 2012 the NHS Pay         Review Body Report &#8212; Market Facing Pay "recommend[ed] a fundamental           review of high cost area supplements, [and] appropriate use of local           recruitment and retention premia" on the basis of the research         into how NHS labour markets are connected to the private sector" [e]       &#8226; Review of Resource Allocation Adjustment for the Excess Costs of           Health Care Services       Having been commissioned by the NHS Scotland Resource Allocation         Committee (NRAC), impact resulted from production of a report to NRAC         and presentations of research to the NRAC Committee.
The research formed         part of the evidence base for the recommendations in NRAC's 2007 final         report.
It developed and applied a method for compensating Health Boards         in Scotland for local variations in the unavoidable excess costs of         delivering health services to different geographical areas.
The report         was published in full by the Committee and was the basis of a full         consultation, after which further work was commissioned.
Recommendations         by HERU on the hospital cost adjustment and that for travel-intensive         community health services were accepted by the Committee.
The Committee         wrote: "The new adjustment for unavoidable excess costs reflects a           rigorous programme of research...[which] provides a better reflection           of all unavoidable excess costs of supplying health services rather           than just remoteness."
As a result of the research, the model used         to predict the costs of travelling to deliver services in the community         was updated to encompass the activities and travel times of a variety of         community staff.
This adjustment in turn affects the formula which now         distributes funding for hospital and community services to Health Boards         in Scotland.

&#8226; Local and Regional Pay Structures for Teachers in England and Wales       The research project focusing on school teachers in England and Wales         proposed and implemented a method for redesigning the regional and local         structure of pay, showing how the Review Body might allocate different         local authorities to different local pay bands.
The research was         disseminated in 2009 via presentations to the Office for Manpower         Economics, Scottish Government Health Department, Department of Health,         HM Treasury, and Cabinet Office, as well as through frequent informal         and follow-up meetings and participation in a seminar at Number 11         Downing Street in 2012.
As a result the findings form part of the         evidence base cited by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his letter to         the Review Bodies in March 2012 [g].
In summary, the research has had impacts on public policy and services         in the following ways: policy debate has been stimulated and advanced by         research evidence; policy decisions have been informed by research         evidence; and the implementation of a policy for funding hospitals and         setting the pay of health service professionals and teachers or the         delivery of a public service has changed.
The purpose of these policy         changes is to improve the quality, accessibility, acceptability or         cost-effectiveness of the health and education service.
The claimed impact, as defined by REF guidance, is therefore on: policy           debate and decisions, legislation and service delivery influenced by           research.
