Shaping and influencing EU policy and legislation       In developing the roadmap on procedural rights the EC accepted the       findings in 3.1 that existing European Convention on Human Rights       (ECHR) standards were not met in practice.
The interim results of 3.4       were presented at an EU Experts Meeting in March 2009, attended by       delegates from most EU Member States as well as senior EU civil servants,       and were critical at this stage in promoting the need for the Roadmap.
Following adoption of the roadmap, an Impact Assessment was commissioned       in preparation for issuing each proposed Directive under the Roadmap, and       the research in 3.1 and/or 3.4 was cited as a major source       of information in each of the three impact assessments published to date (5.2,       5.3, and 5.4).
Further, as a result of the research, Ed       Cape was retained as an expert for the impact assessment of the proposed       Directive on Safeguards for Children and other Vulnerable Persons in       Criminal Proceedings.
The lead EU civil servant responsible for major       aspects of the legislative programme, and who represented the Commission       in the negotiations, said that she `routinely used both Suspects in         Europe and Effective Criminal Defence in Europe'.
She said       of the latter that it was the `"bible" for the negotiations, and certainly       when it was cited, that tended to be the end of the argument as it was       recognised as being the leading study in the field, and wholly reliable' (5.1).
The influence of the research studies is also evidenced by the fact that       the EU commissioned further research from Cape and others, `Procedural       Rights for Suspects in Police Detention in the EU: Empirical investigation       and promoting best practice' (2011 - 2013, 332,934 Euros), to develop       knowledge and understanding of how the procedural rights governed by the       Directives work in practice     4.

Improving policy-makers' understanding of deficiencies         in national laws, policies and practices       Professor Cape, and other members of the research teams, has been invited       to present the findings of the research at a large number of conferences       and similar events organised by the EU and government ministries,       promoting debate and influencing the implementation of European standards       concerning procedural rights amongst politicians, policy-makers and civil       servants.
These include conferences organised by the German Ministry of       Justice (Berlin, 6 September 2010), the Helsinki Foundation for Human       Rights in Poland (Warsaw, 4 April 2011), the Polish Presidency of the EU       (Warsaw, 5-6 December 2011), and the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine/US       Department of Justice (Kiev, 13 December 2012)     The Carloway Review, established by the Scottish Executive to examine the       implications of the Supreme Court decision in Cadder v HMA for       Scots law and procedure, made explicit reference to the findings of the       research (3.4) in informing its understanding of defence rights in       EU Member States (5.5)     4.

Informing the training of judges, prosecutors and         lawyers regarding respect for and implementation of procedural rights       The body of research has been used to inform the training of judges,       prosecutors and lawyers across the European Union.
Events at which       Professor Cape has been invited to present papers based on the research       include the Academy of European Law (ERA) conference Guaranteeing         Procedural Safeguards in the EU &#8212; A First Step Taken (Trier,       Germany, November 2010); the Academy for Young Judges and Prosecutors:         European Criminal Justice (ERA, Trier, Germany, January and February       2011); and the Summer Course on European Criminal Justice (ERA,       Trier, Germany, June/July 2011, July 2012 and June 2013 (attended by a       total of 272 judges, prosecutors, civil servants and lawyers from at least       23 European jurisdictions).
The Chinese translation of 3.4 has       been distributed to rural legal aid lawyers in China to provide an       information resource on best practice     4.

Influencing the work and policy of NGOs in Europe and         other regions       The research findings have also been used by the Justicia consortium of       international NGOs in seeking to influence EU discussion on the proposed       EU Directive on the Right of Access to a Lawyer and to Communicate Upon       Arrest (5.6), and by the European Criminal Bar Association to       influence EU discussion on the proposed EU Directive on the right to legal       aid (5.7 and 5.8).
The research methodology developed in the Effective         Criminal Defence in Europe study (3.4), which was designed to       be used where academic and financial resources are limited, was employed       for the further study in five eastern European countries.
This was       commissioned by an NGO (Soros Foundation &#8212; Moldova) and largely       implemented by NGO employees (3.5), and used by those NGOs in their       strategic approaches to improving procedural rights.
The research has       inspired, and the methodology adapted for, research by NGOs on the       procedural rights of suspects and accused persons in six Latin American       countries &#8212; Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Columbia, Guatemala and Mexico &#8212;       during 2012 to 2013.
Dejusticia, the Columbian NGO that is managing the       project, has said of the two European studies (3.4 and 3.5)       that `without those publications, this regional project would not have       ensued' (5.9)
