     This project developed a new tamponade agent to enhance the clinical       outcome after treatment of retinal detachments.
Standard tamponade agents       are based on silicone oils which can emulsify in the eye and cause adverse       side effects.
The underpinning research provided proof of principle that a       silicone oil with an increased extensional viscosity had an increased       resistance to emulsification.
This was achieved by the addition of a low       percentage of a very high molecular weight polymer of the same chemistry       to the silicone oil.
Following on from this the UoL established that the       extensional viscosity property of the blend also made the material easier       to inject in comparison with an equivalent silicone oil with the same       shear viscosity but without the high molecular weight additive.
An additional benefit of this approach is that since there has been no       chemically different material added to the clinical grade silicone oil the       regulatory requirements were easier.
In 2007 a collaboration was       established with Fluoron GmbH, a silicone oil tamponade manufacturer, to       develop the proof of principle prototype into a clinical grade product.
Fluoron GmbH licensed the technology from the University and have since       contributed a minimum payment of &#163;10k pa and paid all patent costs.
Fluoron GmbH launched the product named Siluron&#174; 2000 in 2008 (EC       certification: CE 575554) [4,6].
It accounted for 32% of its sales by       units in the period 2008-13 with 34,208 sales by 30th September       2013 [11].
A second product named Siluron&#174; Xtra based on this technology       was launched for sale in July 2013 (EC certification: CE 575554).
This       product has 10% of the high molecular weight additive further increasing       the resistance to emulsification while maintaining the ease of injection       within the range of current clinical products.
Fluoron GmbH have brought       this second product to market in response to requests from vitreoretinal       surgeons [5] and it has sold 1,145 units part way through its first year       of introduction [11].
These products have enabled Fluoron to gain new       customers and reduce complaint rates by 40% [11].
The ultimate beneficiaries will be patients.
Current tamponade agents are       either made from 1000mPas silicone oil that is known to emulsify in the       eye and cause adverse effects for the patient or 5000mPas silicone oil       that is very viscous and difficult to inject.
All silicone oils are       currently removed after 3-6 months because of the risk of emulsification       leading to complications.
The new Siluron&#174; 2000 has a shear viscosity of       2000mPas making it easier to inject than 5000mPas oil but because of the       increased emulsification resistance will be less likely to cause adverse       effects to the patient [9,10].
Another major advantage of Siluron&#174; 2000 is       that its extensional viscosity makes it easier to inject than an       equivalent oil meaning that smaller gauge instruments can be used to       inject and remove it from the eye causing a significant reduction in       trauma to the patient's eye due to the surgery.
This also fits very well       with the general move, within vitreoretinal surgery, to the use of smaller       gauge instruments.
Siluron&#174; Xtra has a shear viscosity of 5000mPas and can       therefore be injected and removed using existing surgical equipment but       has been requested by clinicians owing to its enhanced resistance to       emulsification and thus improved clinical outcome for patients.
The market for silicone oil tamponades is not large but is valuable       because the patients requiring this treatment would go blind if not       treated.
The incidence of retinal detachment is reported as 1 per 10,000       of population pa and of these 15-20% are treated with silicone oil       tamponades.
Some vitreoretinal surgeons will not use oils because of the       oil related complications and therefore the availability of an oil with       increased emulsification resistance is expected to increase this treatment       option.
This is the first product specifically designed to address this       problem.
Fluoron GmbH has sold over 25,000 units of Siluron&#174; 2000.
In 2012       the units were sold across 37 different countries with the largest numbers       going to Germany and Egypt and substantial numbers going to Singapore,       Italy, Belgium and Switzerland.
They have recently (August 2013) received       a licence to sell Siluron&#174; 2000 and Xtra in China and believe this to be a       substantial market, expecting to sell over 1000 units in the first year.
An audit of its use in St Paul's Eye Unit at Royal Liverpool University       Hospital on 20 patients reported "Clinically it proved easy to inject and       remove in a small-gauge setup.
Anatomical success rates were comparable to       our experience with standard 5000cst silicone oil, so was its safety       profile."
