     Macaro and collaborators have distilled 14 years' worth of findings       (including R1-R7) from the two       extensive areas of research (interaction and learner strategies) into       eight key pedagogical       principles accessible to end-users: language teachers, teacher educators,       and policy       makers/advisers in Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) [C1].
The impact       process began with the       generation and communication of pedagogical research-based principles,       moved through the       creation of resources (video and paper) and generation of professional       development through       practitioner workshops, to stimulate wider practitioner engagement.
Each       stage was documented       and evaluated.
To give this impact process greater focus in 2012, Macaro       and collaborators       obtained ESRC follow-on funding to carry out and evaluate impact       activities resulting from the       research outlined above.
1) Impact on teachers' pedagogy and that of their departments     A `Consortium for Professional Development in MFL' was established in       2012, initially comprising       teacher educators from Oxford and Reading, and teachers from Oxfordshire,       Berkshire,       Herefordshire and Cambridgeshire, but with the aim of creating a `snowball       effect'.
Development       materials, illustrating how to address the eight key principles, were       refined and produced (March-       May 2012).
The principles and materials were then used by members of the       Consortium (teams of       researchers and school teachers) at 7 national workshops (June 2012-March       2013) attended by       over 300 teachers and teacher trainers as well as representatives of       government agencies       (Department for Education; Ofsted).
In addition, Macaro and Graham were       invited to work through       the principles and connected pedagogy with practitioner members of the       Harris Federation       Academies (a group of 27 primary and secondary academies, educating 20,000       pupils in and       around London) in October 2012.
Two Consortium members were invited to       present at a       conference for MFL department heads run by Leeds Learning Partnership (Feb       2013).
The       Consortium established and is continually developing a website [C1]       through which practitioners       can access, discuss and contribute to the principles and the materials,       and, importantly, which they       can then use to work with their department teams, or teacher education       teams.
As of 31st July       2013, the Consortium website and blog had received over 10,000 hits.
As a result of the workshops, 219 teachers agreed to implement the       pedagogical principles in their       respective school departments.
The Consortium provided follow-up support       for these departments       (via email, the website and in some cases through face-to-face contact).
Questionnaires,       complemented by interviews and reports gathered from many of the schools       who undertook to       implement the principles, indicated a statistically significant increase       in teachers' favourable       attitudes to the principles pre- and post-workshop, an increase in part       sustained by a third       questionnaire administered six months later [C2].
In April 2013, 102 teachers who had implemented the principles       voluntarily reported success in       changing or developing FL pedagogy in their departments [C2],       including much greater and better       quality second language interaction, and a greater focus on       process/strategies in skills       development.
In a subsequent additional survey (N = 40):       92% had used some or all of the principles in their pedagogy;       85% had made or were intending to make changes to their curriculum based       on the principles;       64% reported greater use of quality second language in teacher-students       oral interaction;       54% reported improved reading skills among students.
Teachers from the schools where the principles have been implemented       describe changes to their       pedagogical practice, developing practical applications, "being inspired",       and sharing their own       development with colleagues in their departments.
Examples include:            "I've found the principles have given me a fresh look at different           aspects of my pedagogy...
Most excitingly, it has spurred me on to further develop reading and           writing."
"I have changed the way I `correct' pupils in my Year 7 class &#8212; I           have actively encouraged           them to use their fledgling German for `genuine' communication (i.e.
effectively get a           message across) [...] I am astonished at how a `little and often'           focus on key structures in           Year 7 combined with actively promoting them to re-use these           structures in all kinds of           contexts, often unrelated to the work at hand, has had a great effect           on their ability to write           confidently and enjoy using `real' German."
"I used the `Hiding Out' text idea and created stories (attached if           they're of interest) to fit in           with their topics, with French/Spanish inserted so that we can work on           inferring meaning -           they love being `language detectives'!
From there, they have grown           increasingly confident to           tackle whole sentences in the target language in the same way."
"[We are] rewriting the schemes of work with a focus through the           eyes of the principles."
"I certainly bought into it (the principles) on the course, and           then my faculty have really           bought into it..."          Teachers also report changes in the way students approach language learning:            "Overall it has really improved some of the students' abilities &#8212;           especially reading."
"Students are more aware now of how to go about their tasks and           what processes they need           to go through in order to help them learn something."
"Students are more open to longer and more challenging texts, the           strategies we identified           have been very useful for them."
"Very positive levels of engagement from students, across different           ability levels [...]           Teaching the strategies explicitly was a success."
"Students said they liked the challenging nature of the texts and           that they enjoyed the           responsibility of working more independently [...] they achieved a           good understanding of the           texts.
Many indicated that they were pleasantly surprised that they           could access the material           and that it had given them confidence going forward."
"Many of them gained confidence and a better oral fluency in           Italian."
The Consortium website [C1] hosts teaching resources developed by       teachers who worked with       the principles, ranging from multimedia activities to worksheets, writing       tasks, reading materials,       and display ideas (http://pdcinmfl.com/resources-made-by-you/).
Following a visit to one of the       schools implementing the principles, the Chief Executive of the National       College for School       Leadership noted how the research-based principles had been "shared ...         round the school and         the results were going up" [C3].
Ofsted have been kept       updated of the work of the Consortium, and       encouraged to make teachers aware of the website materials.
In recently       published Ofsted       guidelines "Judging the Use of the Target Language by Teachers and         Students" (2013), the       language used to describe "good" and "outstanding" practice is very       similar to that used in the oral       interaction section of the principles, published on the project website.
By March 2013, the snowball effect intended had become evident.
The active       Consortium       expanded from 10 to 35 members by enlisting the help of teacher educators       and other leading       figures in the world of language education.
This created not only the       desired snowball effect but a       consolidation and, above all, greater sustainability of the changes,       accomplished through       engagement with the research.
As a result, from February 2013, the       `original' Consortium helped       the `expanded' Consortium set up `local clusters' of teachers from       different schools and teacher       educators, whereby they rolled out the principles and the materials to       other schools in their locality,       including those in Birmingham, Walsall, Nottingham, Derby, Cheltenham,       Reading, Abingdon,       Oxford, West Oxfordshire, Newcastle, Lincoln, Sussex, Portsmouth, and       Durham.
For example, in       Portsmouth, following a successful initial cluster meeting, the PGCE MFL       course leader       (Portsmouth University) set up a Google Group where teachers share       resources related to the       principles.
Macaro and collaborators continue to support the clusters and       have applied for       additional resources with which to do this as effectively as possible.
2) Impact on MFL Language Teacher Education Programmes     The principles have been adopted in teacher education programmes such as       at Nottingham       University, Sheffield Hallam University, Sussex University, Portsmouth       University, Birmingham City       University, Newman University, Birmingham University, and Newcastle       University.
This adoption of       the principles has resulted in hundreds of future MFL teachers       experimenting with the distillation of       the research in their teaching practice.
For example, at Nottingham       University, according to the       PGCE MFL course leader [C4], the principles have been incorporated       into the conceptual model of       the course; while at Sheffield Hallam University they have led to "a         permanent change in the way         that we think about language teaching and language learning",       reflected in the fact that tutors       "actually rewrote the session to draw on the more strategic approach         that had been flagged up in         the workshop."
[C5] A teacher trainer from Newman University       emphasises that "the principles and         materials provide a strong framework from which student teachers in         particular can interrogate         their understanding of how modern language teaching is delivered in         schools.
It supports them in         questioning the status quo and in evaluating the quality of pupil         interactions in the classroom."
[C6]       Another PGCE tutor (Nottingham University) comments on the portability and       sustainability of       changes achieved in light of the principles: "I am moving over to Teach         First and will be embedding         the above in my teaching sessions and in conversations at school with         the student teachers and         their mentors."
The President of the Association for Language Learning (ALL) [C7],       who is also a teacher, sums       up the impact of this research as follows: "I think this project has         done more to bridge the gap         between research and teaching than any other project I know of.
Perhaps         this is because the         principles distil succinctly some key methodological pointers and         describe them in such a way that         teachers can immediately take hold of them[...].I have no doubt that the         [workshops] day was         instrumental in seeding the changes that I have witnessed in my project         colleagues over the past         year."
The Languages Professional lead at the CfBT Education Trust       (and former ALL President)       adds: "this project, involving a wide range of teachers across a whole         spectrum of schools, has         been [...] very effective in terms of the impact that it has had.
It is         very clear, from the teacher         responses I have seen, that the eight Principles and their associated         pedagogical materials have         been very well received and have pushed teachers to interrogate and         alter their practice."
