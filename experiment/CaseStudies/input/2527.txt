     Concrete is the most ubiquitous of all building materials, available and       used globally, with cement (its active ingredient) consumed in excess of       2000 million tonnes annually.
However, despite its extensive use, it has       developed significant negative associations, for example, with high carbon       emissions.
Pedreschi has successfully communicated his research directly       to the concrete industry in order to help it challenge outside       perceptions, as confirmed by the [text removed for publication] The       Concrete Society in Scotland (see 5.1, below), who has said... "the         fact that work of this nature and calibre is being done here, in         Scotland, has helped us, as an industry, improve the image and         reputation of concrete as a material, so much so that we are currently         preparing for a major exhibition on concrete, with Architecture and         Design Scotland, which focuses on sustainability and innovation as key         themes and have a number of schools [across central Scotland] seeking         to work with concrete as a truly cross curriculum medium".
The       research has also changed attitudes within the wider construction       industry, as described by construction industry professional, [text       removed for publication] USA; see 5.2), who has said... "Prior to this         research, concrete was often perceived of as a harsh, aggressive         material.
Experimentation with fabric forming has shown that it doesn't         have to be so; that it's possible to create more interesting, organic         forms, with a richer texture than before, and with reduced environmental         impact".
In November 2008, the book Fabric Formwork received a Special       Commendation in the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA)       President's Awards for Research (see 5.3).
The president said "It         represents a very exciting series of initiatives... and shows us how the         genesis of an idea with an architecture school can influence practising         architects and find its way through to completed projects".
In 2009, the multi-award-winning garden designer, [text removed for       publication], approached the Alliance to produce Fabric Formed Concrete       elements for his 2009 Chelsea Flower Show entry, having read an article on       the possibilities of the technology and undertaken research into       innovators in the field.
[text removed for publication] said of the       Edinburgh team "the shapes and textures that they are experimenting         with are beautiful and the possibilities for a garden structure almost         infinite".
For [text removed for publication] Chelsea entry, The Fenchurch Garden,       the team designed, constructed and delivered 19 `tree root' shaped       concrete panels, each up to 2.5 metres in height and weighing 700kg,       within a five-week timeframe.
The panels were described as "exceptional,         inspiring and innovative" by the Chelsea judges and the garden went       on to win the 2009 RHS Silver Gilt Medal and Most Creative Design Award       and to be widely publicised by the BBC, The Guardian, The         Daily Telegraph and Garden Design Journal.
The Enduring         Gardener blogged... "The gardens that really appeal to me are the         ones that confound my prejudices [and] make me reconsider a         particular material.
The Fenchurch Garden made me look at concrete in an         entirely new way" (see 5.4).
Alliance researchers are now discussing       a second project with [text removed for publication], again for the       Chelsea Flower Show.
Industry recognition led to architects, John McAslan + Partners, funding       a project to enhance the exterior of Castleview Primary School in       Edinburgh, based on the system developed in the University's Knowledge       Transfer Partnership with Watson Stonecraft.
Over a three-week period in       2009, Pedreschi, trainee architects and the school's P6 pupils       collaboratively designed and constructed a series of Fabric Formed       Concrete wall panels in the University workshops.
In 2010, the panels were       installed on the school site by Stone Engineering and later incorporated       into the Craigmillar Heritage Trail.
The project was supported by the       local community, several small businesses and the City of Edinburgh       Council and has been described thus [text removed for publication]:     "In order to eradicate the poverty of ambition in Scotland, it is         vital for schools to be involved in partnership working.
Castleview         Primary School is situated in an area of regeneration in Craigmillar         Edinburgh.
For some of our pupils, they were the first members of their         family to have been inside a university and they are now aware that with         hard work and perseverance they could access a university education.
The         result of our collaboration, the Castleview Wall, featured in the         Craigmillar Historical Trail and made children aware that they could         create their own history for their community.
Castleview's partnership         working has been acknowledged as "sector leading" during a recent HMIE         inspection [which saw the school, which had previously faced       closure, transformed into one of the most highly rated in the country] and         was a City of Edinburgh award winner.
The Wall Project exemplifies         Curriculum for Excellence at its best" (see 5.5).
The Castleview wall was launched in June 2010 at an event addressed by       the children and attended by [text removed for publication] (see 5.6).
He       said "I am delighted to see the great work done by the children and am         deeply grateful for the input from Remo and the University.
It is of         lasting benefit to the school and of everlasting benefit to the         particular children involved".
The MSP has since become proactive in       initiating collaboration between the University and pupils at Portobello       High School.
They have been involved in workshops to develop materials and       modules for teaching construction under the new Curriculum for Excellence       and, together with digital technology experts, a generic 80-credit Masters       level module on Disruptive Technology.
The international impact of the project builds on success in the European       Concrete Design competition, Plastic Opacity, and in the US-led Concrete         Thinking for a Sustainable World competition (2008).
Links have been       made with the Canadian Concrete Association and the Federal Center of       Technological Education (CEFET) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.
The University       of Edinburgh is a founding member of the International Society of Fabric       Forming, with Remo Pedreschi delivering the keynote speech at its second       international conference in Bath (June 2012).
At this event, the team also       held a workshop for global industry professionals, artists and academics       using Fabric Formed Concrete panels in a prototype framing system.
Latterly, the research has facilitated closer collaboration between the       concrete and textile industries.
Two knowledge sharing workshops have been       held, including Textiles in the Environment and Construction,       funded by Scottish Enterprise, in June 2011.
The Alliance has started a       `proof of concept' project with J&amp;D Wilkie, as well as established       links with other Scottish manufacturers of `technical textiles'; global       growth rates for which are approximately 4% per year greater than for home       and apparel textiles.
[text removed for publication] J&amp;D Wilkie has       said "Remo's enthusiasm for all things concrete is infectious and... we         have become more actively involved in developing some of our technical         textiles for specific use in concrete applications.
The market holds         interesting possibilities for us and we would not have found it nor         developed products for it without [the Alliance's] input"       (see 5.7).
