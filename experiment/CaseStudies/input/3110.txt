BBC Prehistoric Autopsy Ep 2: Homo erectus broadcast 24 Oct 2012 [3,4]     LJMU research substantially informed the content and presentation of         four BBC2 TV programmes     LJMU's established reputation for research into human evolution,       spearheaded by Professor Wheeler, has led to his being sought after as the       production scientific consultant and an on-screen participant for numerous       television programmes made during this REF period.
These use his expertise       on and behind the scenes to create and inform the content and direction of       these programmes.
Television producers seek to represent the evolving       human form in a well-grounded yet accessible context.
In this milieu,       Wheeler's research reconstructing hominid behaviour, palaeobiology and       palaeoecology [1,2,3,4] is inherently more useful than most       palaeoanthropology research, which focuses upon phylogenetic       reconstruction.
Wheeler's interaction with the producers of television       programmes allows research and current thinking in the field to be       represented visually using the shorthand of physical reconstructions of       the hominid body in action, with all associated constraints and       capabilities.
BBC staff confirm that LJMU research underpinned these programmes [D,E]       LJMU research led to new and better reconstructions of human form and       function, which led to the making of television programmes using this new       perspective.
Wheeler's research was heavily drawn upon for scripting and       producing these programmes [D].
His research was considered to be       `fantastic', and he was `very helpful with the research into the       programme' and gave a `very informative' interview (for i, D).
LJMU research increased the understanding of evolutionary anthropology         by engaging millions of people around the world via the medium of         mainstream broadcast TV [i,ii,iii,iv] and an accompanying exhibition         [iv]     Ratings for the initial broadcasts of these programmes:                                     Ref.

Programmes were rebroadcast on the BBC and more recent ones available for       download from the internet via their iPlayer application (figures only       available for iii = 96k downloads; iv = 111k downloads, E).
Furthermore, these programmes are sold to broadcasters overseas and       retransmitted, although viewing figure are not available.
The range of       countries where these programmes have been purchased and rebroadcast       includes Australia (i,ii), Mexico (ii) , New Zealand (ii), New Zealand       (ii), Belgium (ii), Italy (ii), Netherlands (ii), Israel (ii), Denmark       (ii), Spain (ii) South Africa (SABC; ii) , USA (i, ii) and Germany (i, ii)       Hungary (iii), Finland (ii, iii) Sweden (ii, iii).
A DVD was released for       (iv), and this programme was available for download via iTunes, widening       its reach and permanence.
Horizon is co-produced by the Discovery       Channel and rebroadcast extensively on that network (i,ii) [E].
These episodes have also been sold for in-flight entertainment on       Emirates and other airlines [E].
Programme iv had a public outreach strategy which included public       lectures and exhibits at Birmingham Thinktank (22 - 25 October 2012);       Manchester Museum (27 - 30 October 2012); Great North Museum Hancock,       Newcastle (1- 4 November 2012); National Museum Cardiff (8 - 11 November       2012); Horniman Museum, London: (14 - 18 November 2012); National Museum,       Scotland (23 - 25 November 2012).
De Groote gave Prehistoric Autopsy       Uncovered talks at Manchester Museum (29 October 2012); Great North Museum       (4 November 2012); and at Horniman Museum (18 November 2012) and wrote an       accompanying article for Focus magazine (September 2012 issue       246).
The museums contacted confirmed good visitor numbers for the dates       associated with the talks and exhibitions.
Following one talk (London,       n=35) audience volunteers completed a short survey which showed that 63%       of respondents had changed their ideas about human evolution by the talk       and series, and an additional 13% felt their knowledge was expanded.
Crucially, of those surveyed 77% were able to recount a feature of human       evolution which they had learned from the series and talk, demonstrating       the efficacy of this programming and outreach in increasing the       understanding of human evolution.
LJMU Research Improved the performance of the creative industries by         helping secure ~&#163;1m in commissions and enabling production of programmes         about topics that are not easily communicated through the medium of         television     Figures from the BBC website and from the producers consulted confirm       that each of these programmes had a budget ranging from &#163;127k - &#163;140k to       produce [C,D,E].
Securing the participation of academic staff who       will provide their research and ideas is often important in the       commissioning decisions, and provides a guarantee that the production       companies will make interesting, factual, and informative programmes.
Often Wheeler is consulted at an early stage of the project so his       expertise is essential to the programmes getting funding and being       produced.
Further, the success of science programmes underpinned by LJMU       research helps secure commissions for other programmes within the genre,       for example the success of Horizon programmes (i, ii) led to the series       commission for (iii; 5 episodes) [D].
Another impact of our research and consultancy is providing input to       production companies about what is not easily communicated through the       medium of television, as was the case for an episode of Bang Goes the         Theory; this was described as essential assistance and "one of the       `hidden' values of academic consultation."
[E,1,3].
It is       difficult to make a television programme purely about fossil bones and       teeth so the fleshing-out that Wheeler's research makes possible is       instrumental to the interface between the science and the general public.
