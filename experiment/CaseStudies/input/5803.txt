     The major impact of research conducted in the Chemistry department       relates to commercial impact with regard to the bio-pharmaceutical       industry and impact on practitioners and services.
The generation of a       pure drug was made possible through the development of new synthesis       routes that made the launch of phase 2 clinical trials possible.
Based on       the research outcomes, and as a result of the Phase 2 trials, TauRx was       able to raise &#163;320 million in external investment, now employs 17       chemists, 5 biologists, and 14 clinicians.
In relation to chemistry       activities alone TauRx under Storey's supervision is now working in       collaboration with 7 companies: Shasun Pharma Solutions (Newcastle upon       Tyne, UK), Roberts Chemicals (UK), Lonza Pharma (Visp, Switzerland),       Bohinger (USA), Bayer Schering (Berlin), Piramal Healthcare (Newcastle and       Berlin), and Almac Sciences (Edinburgh and Craigavon).
Through these       commercial collaborations, three centres have been established to each       manufacture 5 tonnes of the candidate drug as part of the validation       campaign based on the patent [4].
Each validation campaign represents an       income of &#163;2.5 million for the companies concerned within the REF period.
In addition the ongoing manufacture of 400 tonnes between the three sites,       to be completed by May 2015 to coincide with completion of the Phase 3       trials, represents a total investment already achieved for these companies       of approximately &#163;35 million.
Shasun Pharma Solutions Ltd has advised that the company had an initial       production of 6 metric tonnes of the drug, and has now established a       manufacturing capability of 150 metric tonnes per annum, which will       potentially increase to 250 metric tonnes per annum.
This would see       commercial revenues in the longer term reaching several hundreds of       millions of pounds.
There will also be longer term impact for Shasun UK       and Shasun India resulting from increased demand for the drug, both in       terms of commercial return and job creation throughout the supply chain       [a].
In terms of UK impact the company states "Should the forecast API         demand be recognised, it will not only provide opportunities for Shasun         in the UK, but also have significant local impact involving local         engineering manufacturing, supply and support requirements for pipework,         reactors and filter dryers along with bulk storage tanks and ancillary         equipment including increased waste handling and treatment facilities on         site.
For example, should the API requirement reach 500 metric tonnes         per annum, Shashun UK would need to invest in equipment from UK         suppliers of up to &#163;10M and procure goods and services from the north         East region of up to &#163;5M.
Manufacture of the API on this scale could         lead to the creation of up to 80 jobs at the Shashun UK site."
[a]     A second manufacturer is Piramal Healthcare (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK).
Piramal advise that to meet the requirements of producing tablets at the       amounts required for the initial trials the company has engaged nine       further employees at its Morpeth facility, with a current project revenue       in excess of USD 1 Million for FY 2013 and 2014.
The company states that       this revenue provides a platform for the company to grow and develop its       team.
"Tablet supply is now approaching 1,500,000 with batches released         to clinical sites in the UK, Europe, US and Asia, this is truly a         program with global reach.
We hope very much it will result in a         marketed product that provides therapeutic benefits to a patient         population that sadly has a current unmet need."
[b]     Supply of raw materials to the drug manufacturers is a crucial component       of the impact of the Aberdeen research.
Roberts Chemicals Ltd describe the       company's role in supply and logistics for procurement of starting       materials.
"The financial impact on Roberts is to have enabled         strategic growth planning at a very early stage in the company's         development.
Critically, the company has been able to promote and market         its next generation business model much more forcefully than expected.
This has led to an international portfolio of users of its business         model-cleverly adapted to the current economic downturn.
TauRx are about         to undertake a large manufacturing validation campaign at three major         pharma companies.......Roberts will supply the starting materials for         these campaigns" [c].
Looking to the future, a potential longer term impact, resulting from the       synthetic and analytical chemistry performed in the Chemistry department       under Storey's supervision relates to the clinical trials of the drugs       developed.
The Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust       has direct clinical experience with methylthioninium chloride (MTC) and       leuco-methylthioninium bis(hydromethanesulfonate) (LMTM) drugs developed       in the TauRx project, and is involved in clinical trials.
The Trust       confirms: "In AD, in addition to extracellular deposition of b-amyloid         protein, there is also intracellular aggregation of tau protein.
Several         lines of evidence indicate that aggregation of tau protein is central to         neurodegeneration in AD.
.Numerous laboratory studies show that MTC,         when administered in various forms, is effective in disaggregating tau         protein... Data from a large phase-2 clinical trial of MTC also provides         some evidence of benefit in AD.
Based on the Phase &#8212; 2 experience TauRx         elected to discontinue clinical studies with MTC and develop         leuco-methylthioninium bis(hydromethanesulfonate) (LMTM)" [d].
As a       consequence of the success of these Phase 2 trials, a series of Phase 3       trials were organised which commenced in November 2012.
These involve an       international trial of 1,800 patients, with the data release scheduled for       May 2015.
In the opinion of a leading consultant from the trust, "if         LMTM is shown to have the expected efficacy in the Phase-3 AD and FTD         studies then it has the potential to be a `Game Changer' in terms of how         we manage these conditions" [d].
