     The research developed through the three KTP projects has enabled the       development of a new individualised systems approach-led design capability       through embedding new design departments and processes in each company.
The impact of this research is evident through a range of indicators, from       both within the companies and through external awards and testimony.
Impact is evident in the following key areas:            Enhanced design capability through an enhanced understanding of new         (niche) markets and their audiences and the deposition of this knowledge         in new design and technical databases to retain competitive advantage.
Enhanced in-house manufacturing capability (Tough Furniture) through         standardization and modularization of furniture components;         harmonization of the ergonomic patterns with material supply sizes;         creating and implementing a full CAD library of existing and new         products with technical data accessible to both production and sales         departments; linking the design facility with the new Enterprise         Resource Planning (ERP) System.
The improvements made as part of the projects (China Industries, Tough         Furniture) have resulted in an increase in turnover and profits of ca.
22% each within the first year for Tough Furniture, and 300% growth in         sales turnover for China International (from &#163;4,749,000 to &#163;15,300,000).
Again this is a significant increase given that the growth is against         the trend of the continuing recession during and after the time of the         project.
Significantly increased number of employees: Not only have several of         the KTP associates subsequently been employed permanently as design         manager or similar, but overall the number of employees has more than         doubled from 12 to 27 for Tough Furniture, and near tripled for China         Industries Ltd from 12 to 35.
In addition China Industries expanded its         market share from 0 to 20%.
This is against the background of the UK's         deep depression associated with reduced or no funding for the         traditional clients of Tough Furniture in particular.
Improved customer or stakeholder satisfaction (Tough Furniture): the         new systems allow firstly a significantly faster design response to         customer inquiries with the time from inquiry to design concept offer         (quote) being reduced from over 3 days to under 12 hours.
Secondly, the         new visual tools enable customers to better visualise concepts on offer         to them, thus helping in the decision making process.
Improved User satisfaction: the increased range of furniture for         specialist areas has resulted in evident user satisfaction with the         products on offer as is evident from the case studies on the company's         website.
Increased external recognition for Tough Furniture's contribution both         to design and to the community through social health, well-being and         inclusion as evidenced through a number of awards: for example Tough         Furniture won 1) the 2010 Shropshire Business award: Technology,         Innovation and Enterprise.
2) the special recognition category at the         PraxisUnico National Impact Awards 2012.
Increased external recognition for China Industries Ltd. through         several awards: 1) international HSBC Business Thinking Award 2010; 2)         Orange Innovation Award Finalist 2010; 3) Orange National Business         Awards 2010.
In summary, areas that can be recognized benefitting from the impact of       this research are:            The SME's themselves       Educational (extending the knowledge, skills and expertise of         individuals within the community)       Health and well-being of the community (physical and mental)          Social inclusion (disadvantaged, marginalized and at-risk groups)
