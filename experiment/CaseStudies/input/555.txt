     The body of research undertaken at Plymouth University provided important       components of       scientific evidence leading to regulatory change at the EC level and       involved significant industry       investment in research and development leading to improved competitiveness       of the EC       aquaculture industry, a reduction in the environmental impact of fish       farming and improved fish       health and welfare.
New scientific information about the safety and efficacy of inclusion of       monoPAPs in farmed       fish diets was established, which led to regulatory change at the EC level       (Regulation introduced       Feb 2013), permitting re-authorization of the use of monoPAPs in       aquaculture diets.
The Plymouth team worked closely with The European Fat Processors and       Renderers       Association (EFPRA) and this industry investment in research and       development directly led to       regulatory change.
EFPRA Technical Director stated that "I can say with         certainty that the success         of the programme to achieve re-authorisation of the use of these         important resources could not         have been completed without the scientific input from Professor Simon         Davies and his team."
As a result of this research, EU dependency on imported alternative       protein sources for use in       aquaculture feeds is now decreasing and there is a measured contribution       to global food security       by reducing seafood imports.
The research has also contributed to the       Common Fisheries Policy of       aligning sustainable wild fisheries with sustainable aquaculture       development.
The new legislation has been welcomed for its environmental impact; by       using PAPs to provide       feed for fish, the EU aquaculture industry's dependency on fishmeal and       soya, which have high       environmental costs, will be reduced.
"The production of soya meal         requires vast areas of land,         fertiliser and water and has to be transported great distances to reach         European borders" EFPRA       President Niels Leth Nielsen.
The regulatory change means that competitiveness in world markets has       been enhanced.
It       has been welcomed by countries across Europe.
"This measure paves the         way for our EU         aquaculture producers to step up their efforts to encourage the         sustainable development of EU         aquaculture by creating a level playing field with seafood imports from         third countries".
"The new         measure contributes to global food security, by reducing the EU         dependency on seafood imports         which account for more than 70% of the current EU consumption".

The re-introduction of monoPAPs for fish is seen as the first step for a       range of new policies in       the EU.
The EU (press release) has stated that the re-introduction of PAPs       "will improve the overall         sustainability of the aquaculture sector, since these PAPs could be a         valuable substitute for         fishmeal, which is a scarce resource.
Yesterday's measure is a first         step as the Commission,         subject to specific analytical tests, intends to propose a further         measure to re-introduce the use of         pig and poultry PAPs for poultry and pigs."

The research on the inclusion of the probiotic P. acidilactici in       fish diets was carried out in close       collaboration with Lallemand SAS and enabled them to present new evidence       to the EC.
This is a       Lallemand SAS probiotic and Lallemand SAS extensively cited the research       undertaken at       Plymouth in their successful submission to the EC.
This industry       investment in research and       development resulted in P. acidilactici MA18/5M (Bactocell&#174;)       being authorized in 2012 as a       zootechnical additive in aquatic diets for all fish species.
Dr Mathieux Castex of Lallemand SAS indicated that the "scientific         information and particularly         the invaluable contribution from the University of Plymouth group         allowed Lallemand to support         several evidences to demonstrate and confirm the then proposed mode of         action of P. acidilacitici         MA 18/5M (Bactocell&#174;) in fish"     The authorization has impacted on the commercial success of global feed       additive and       aquaculture companies including Lallemand SAS and BioMar.
BioMar's       Research and       Development Director stated that "the research output of the Aquatic         Animal Nutrition and Health         Research Group was a significant component in the scientific data of the         extension dossier".
There       has been a considerable economic impact; BioMar has increased annual       production of fish feed       with Bactocell from 8000 tonnes of fish feed to 35,000 tonnes (NB figures       in commercial       confidence).
BioMar's Technical Director also attributes improved fish       welfare as a benefit of this       research estimating that the cost of fish deformities to hatcheries in the       Mediterranean area alone       amounts to over 20 - 25 million EUR per year.
He indicates that "even a         minor reduction in the         number of deformities will mean an enormous economic saving in the         hatcheries and a reduced         workload."
