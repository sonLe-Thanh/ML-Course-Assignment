     Lingas founded Cappella Romana (CR) in 1991.
Today he continues to guide       CR as its Artistic Director, the ensemble having since grown into a       non-profit corporation based in the state of Oregon, USA with a current       annual budget of around $300,000 and total expenditure over the REF period       of approximately $1.4 million.
CR generated revenue from earned income       (tickets, hiring fees, commercial recordings and licensing), individual       donations (232 households in the 2012/13 financial year) and grants from       governmental agencies and private foundations.
Lingas' research has been fundamental to CR's operation throughout the       period, shaping its concert programming of ancient and modern repertoire,       informing its approaches to vocal performance practice and guiding its       educational and outreach efforts to cultivate Orthodox musical traditions       in both public and ecclesiastical settings.
CR has thereby served members       of ethnic communities (Greeks, Russians, etc., whether in their homelands       or in diaspora) and converts to Orthodoxy wishing to preserve and transmit       their musical heritage.
At the same time it has promoted widely       experiences and understanding of Orthodox musical traditions amongst       people from other cultural and spiritual backgrounds.
These have included       individuals drawn to the history, aesthetics and spiritual qualities of       Eastern Orthodox art and liturgy, as well as devotees of classical and       world genres of vocal ensemble music.
Recognising this, Metropolitan       Gerasimos, Greek Orthodox Metropolitan of San Francisco, wrote in a 2011       letter that the ensemble 'is more than just a choral group; they are         ambassadors of our Holy Orthodox faith through music'.
Glen W.       Bowersock offered another perspective in The New York Review of Books,       noting that 'The success of the contemporary Cappella Romana chamber         ensemble, ably directed by Alexander Lingas of London, introduces modern         listeners to the sounds that filled the churches of Byzantium no less         than the light of their lamps' (25/9/08).
Specific impactful       activity since 2008 includes:             Presenting an Annual Subscription Concert Series in Portland, OR           and Seattle, WA, USA.
Seasons consist of four or more concerts         performed at least once in each city with total attendance during the         impact period of 16,902.
The series gives the ensemble a laboratory to         expand its repertory before a loyal 'home' audience and therefore often         includes world or American premieres.
A lecture precedes nearly every         concert and approximately 25% of events feature guest artists.
Audience         diversity is reflected in the range of media outlets praising the         performances.
Describing a concert of Byzantine Christmas chant, Rod         Parke of The Seattle Gay News (1/15/10) wrote 'the passionate           intensity with which they sang, combined with the exotic nature of           this unfamiliar music, had at times an almost erotic feel.
To ears           that gradually opened to the unaccustomed harmonies and pitches, it           was anything but dull.'
In The Oregonian (the main         Portland newspaper), James McQuillen noted that during a 2013         performance of Rachmaninoff's Divine Liturgy 'the sensual           appeal was inescapable, and it carried through the evening with           crystal clarity, gentle cadences and phrases as natural as breath'         (12/1/13).
Touring.
CR presented over 50 non-series concerts at locations         including Oxford (2009), London (2009 and 2013), Regensburg (2013),         Boston (2012), Yale University (2009 and 2011), New York (2009 and         2012), San Francisco (2011), Los Angeles (2012), Vancouver, BC (2009)         and Stanford University (2009 and two concerts in 2013) and in Greece         (two concerts each in 2011 and 2013).
Listeners have often found CR         performances of previously unheard early Orthodox music revelatory.
Upon         hearing medieval Constantinopolitan chant sung at Stanford in the         acoustics of a virtual Hagia Sophia in 2013, Jason Victor Serinus of the         San Francisco Classical Voice wrote 'It is impossible to           describe the experience objectively....
Throwing all caution to the           winds, as it were, the "performance" was the closest to lift-off I           have experienced short of chemically enhanced listening sessions or           the final hours of a seven-days meditation intensive' (1/2/13).
Broadcasting.
Experience and understanding of Orthodox music         was mediated to wider audiences through broadcasts on national, local         and internet media of live and recorded CR performances, as well as         interviews with Lingas and/or other CR colleagues.
These included: BBC         Radio 4 (Byzantium Unearthed, a documentary by Bettany Hughes,         2008 and Something Understood, 2013), BBC Radio 3 (The Choir,         2012), Bavarian Radio (2013) and Greek National Radio and Television         (2011 and 2013) in Europe; in the USA on National Public Radio's Weekend           Edition Sunday (segment on Orthodox Easter in 2012, carried on         nearly 600 stations), American Public Media's Performance Today         (2008, 2009, 2010 with 1.3 million listeners on 260 stations), Indiana         Public Media's Harmonia (2009, 2011 and twice in 2012 on over         150 stations) and repeatedly on local stations of the Pacific Northwest.
Interviews have appeared on internet radio services sponsored by the         national churches of American Orthodox jurisdictions (the Orthodox         Christian Network and Ancient Faith Radio), which also feature CR on         music playlists.
Recording.
During the REF impact period CR was featured on 19         CD titles of early and modern vocal music (most of it previously         unrecorded) with total sales of over 19,000 hard copies (most including         substantial booklets featuring texts, translations and notes), plus         downloads and streaming via iTunes, Amazon, Spotify, etc.
bringing         US$28,890 in revenue for the digital delivery of 4,094 complete albums         and 77,202 individual tracks.
Two titles were marketed under the brand         of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, while a third was a compilation         commissioned for the Royal Academy of Arts (RAA) exhibition 'Byzantium         325-1453' (25/10/2008 to 22/3/2009).
The RAA also licensed tracks for         the audio guide to its exhibition, the attendance for which was 342,726.
Praise by professional reviewers for CR's discs of unfamiliar         pre-modern music has been noted above, but similar themes appear also in         published reviews of contemporary works, e.g., 'Richard           Toensing...has written a spellbinding Christmas choral concerto in           traditional Orthodox style....stunningly realized by Cappella Romana',         Kyle MacMillan, Denver Post (7/12/2008); and 'The liturgical           music of Greek-America composers is barely known outside the USA...the           addition of this English-texted Liturgy...by Peter Michaelides...is           very welcome indeed.
...Cappella Romana... produce what I imagine to           be an ideal performance of Michaelides's music', Ivan Moody, Gramophone         (October 2010).
Fans of CR recordings have communicated their enthusiasm         through both traditional and social media.
For example in 2008 science         fiction author Neal Stephenson wrote in a playlist for The New York           Times (17/9/2008) that 'My favorite style of chant is           Byzantine, which I learned about by attending concerts by...Cappella           Romana.
The single most powerful piece of music I've heard in recent           years is the "Lament for the Fall of Constantinople."
Close your eyes           and you can almost see the Blachernae Walls...'; while a Communion         chant from CR's 2008 recording The Divine Liturgy of St John           Chrysostom... uploaded by a fan to YouTube in 2010 had been viewed         over 60,000 times by 31st July 2013.
Outreach: Education and Pastoral Work.
In addition to         pre-concert talks, CR members regularly offer lectures and workshops on         Orthodox liturgical music open to the general public.
The range of         organisations for which Lingas himself has presented such events         includes the Royal Academy of Arts (2008), Stanford University (2009 and         2013), the Canterbury Gregorian Music Society (2010), the Yale Institute         of Sacred Music (2011), the Axion Estin Foundation of New York (2008,         2010 and 2012), the Border Marches Early Music Forum (2012) and the         Hellenic Centre of London (2013, excerpts later broadcast on Hellenic         TV).
A participant describing the 2010 Canterbury workshop later wrote:         'Alexander showed that both Gregorian Chant and Eastern Chant were           historic musical forms with a living tradition today.
...Our great           triumph was actually reading and singing the whole Orthodox Saturday           Evening Vespers from start to finish.'
CR also works directly with Orthodox churches to serve their pastoral       needs.
It does so in part by offering its skills and repertories in       worship, singing for services in such locations as London (2009), San       Francisco (2011), St Vladimir's Seminary (Crestwood, NY), Los Angeles       (2012) and Athens (2013).
CR's flagship pastoral project is a cooperative       venture with the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain       to set its English liturgical texts to traditional Byzantine chant.
This       has been supported financially by the A.G. Leventis Foundation, the       National Forum of Greek Orthodox Church Musicians (USA), the Virginia H.       Farah Foundation and the [Anglican-Orthodox] Fellowship of St Alban and       St Sergius.
Its first milestone was the release of the 2008 Divine         Liturgy mentioned above, a two-disc recording accompanied by a       40-page booklet with an introduction by Greek Orthodox Archbishop       Gregorios of Thyateira and Great Britain, in which he writes 'I commend         it...with the confidence that it will increase the understanding and         appreciation of both the spirituality of Orthodox worship and the         heights of musical expression to which its chanting aspires.'
Its       musical settings were subsequently released as free PDFs in both Byzantine       neumes and Western staff notation, facilitating transmission of the       musical patrimony of Byzantium across notational, linguistic, ethnic and       religious boundaries through their use in liturgical and educational       contexts such as those listed above.
In recognition of his scholarly and       pastoral work, Lingas received the highest musical award of the Greek       Orthodox Archdiocese of America in 2010.
