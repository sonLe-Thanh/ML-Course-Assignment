     The impact of this research takes three main forms.
Increasing the ethical understanding of HIV health-workers and           policy-makers          As a result of their publications, and presentations to exclusively       medical audiences (e.g.
5th International AIDs Conference, Durban, South       Africa, 2011), Allais and Venter's work has enhanced the ethical       understanding of HIV health-workers and policy-makers.
Evidence of this       takes two forms.
First, Allais was invited to participate in a closed World Health         Organisation meeting on HIV self-testing (`The Legal, Ethical, Gender,         Human Rights and Public Health Implications of HIV Self-Testing         Scale-up, Brocher Foundation, Geneva, 8-9 April 2013).
The aim was to         see whether there is a broad consensus about going forward with         developing self-testing and scaling it up, and to identify research         questions, including ethical concerns, which need to be addressed.
Fifty         doctors and academics, of whom Allais was the only philosopher, were         invited to develop ideas in discussion (rather than via papers).
The         meeting jointly produced a consensus statement on the legal, ethical,         gender, human rights, and public health implications of HIV Self-Testing         scale-up, published in the wider `Report on the First International         Symposium on Self-Testing for HIV: The Legal, Ethical, Gender, Human         Rights and Public Health Implications' [see Section 5, C1], now         available on the WHO website.
Following the meeting, Allais was invited         to submit for consideration to the journal AIDS and Behavior, an         abstract entitled `An evaluation of the ethical and human rights         considerations of HIV self-testing'.
She was then invited to develop the         abstract into an article for publication as part of the March 2014         special edition of the journal on HIV self-testing.
In addition, the         review panel suggested by email [C2] that she and Professor Anne Scott         (Head of the School of Nursing, Dublin City University) collaborate in         further bringing to light the ethical and human rights issues addressed         by the abstract.
Second, positive influence is attested in communications to the         Philosophy Department, following presentations of Allais and Venter's         work both on HIV status-ignorance (presented by Allais), and the         `concurrency' explanation (presented by Venter), at the Royal Sussex         County Hospital in Brighton in December 2012 [C3].
Several participants         commented on how what they had heard had informed them and caused them         to think differently about the issues.
For instance: `It made me think         differently about a question that arose more than once afterwards, which         was whether some form of "compulsory" testing might compensate for the         increasing rates of STIs, HIV and unprotected sex.
My immediate response         would have been negative, but especially the philosophical         presentation/discussion and the narrative on the South African         experience made me think twice' (Chief Executive of HIV Scotland until         October 2011); and `What I found particularly useful was the integration         of philosophical considerations with multidisciplinary clinical research         disciplines...
Particularly for me it brought to the fore the importance         of philosophical and ethical considerations' (Reader in Palliative Care,         King's College London).
A researcher from the Tuke Institute attended         the event, and in October 2013 Dr Rupert Whitaker, co-founder of the         Terrence Higgins Trust and founder of the Tuke Institute, approached         Kathleen Stock with a view to organising a multi-disciplinary research         group on Rights and Responsibilities in HIV at Sussex, including         Philosophy.
Positively influencing the design of a cholera drug trial          Allais's work has led to her involvement in the design of a cholera drug       trial.
Helen Rees, a doctor and vaccine expert at Witswaterand,       recommended Allais to the organiser of the trial at the Center for Vaccine       Ethics and Policy at NYU/Wistar Institute/CHOP on the basis of Allais'       research.
Allais was invited to comment on the trial and her comments are       reproduced in their entirety (pp.
51-53) in the White Paper which followed       [C4].
Her comments concerned the use of a placebo in the trial, whether       informed consent would be achieved from socio-economically deprived       participants, the compensation of any harm resulting from the trial, the       need for community involvement in it, and the training that would be given       to the research ethics committee.
Correspondence from the Center's       Director [C5] attests that `This consultation was complex insofar as it       was proposed to be conducted in a country where the vaccine in question       was already licensed, and was already WHO pre-qualified as a two-dose       regimen.
Ms. Allais shared important insights and perspectives which       assisted us in framing our final recommendations and the final white       paper.
We were please to include some of Professor Allais' direct comments       in the appendix reserved for this purpose'.
Influencing public opinion, through the medical and general media,           on TV, in newspapers and blogs, on philosophical questions to do with           HIV and sexual health          Allais and Venter's work has also caused follow-up articles in       non-academic media, which have had the effect of informing public opinion:            `HIV, logic and sex' is referenced in an article `Immune activation,         inflammation, and HIV acquisition risk', on the medical blog of the         Treatment Action Group's `Michael Palm Basic Science, Vaccines and         Prevention Project' [C6].
Allais' work was discussed in a South African national newspaper &#8212; Times           Live &#8212; blog article, `Philosopher's view on HIV testing and human         rights' (9 June 2011) [C7].
In November 2012, given her expertise in sexual ethics as a result of         her work on sexual health, Allais was a panellist in a public debate,         `Should consenting adults be allowed to pay and be paid for sex?'.
Allais argued that sex work should be decriminalised.
She was         subsequently interviewed for radio and primetime TV news slots.
According to media monitoring services at the University of         Witswaterand, the debate generated exposure of about R 230,650 (&#163;14,120)         in Advertising Value Equivalency (AVE), and an estimated PR value of R         922,600 (&#163;5,638,315).
Her talk also was discussed in South African blog         The Daily Maverick (21 November 2012) [C8].
In April 2013, as a result of this exposure, Allais was invited as a         guest on `3 Talk with Noeleen', a popular daily chat show on national         television channel SABC3, to discuss the decriminalisation of sex work.
