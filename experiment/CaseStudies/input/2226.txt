     Design Unit works closely with the British Gear Association (BGA), which       provides expertise and       support for maintaining and developing BS and ISO gear standards in the       UK.
The BSI committee       MCE/5 Gears is the UK technical committee responsible for providing       the UK input to ISO/TC60         Gears, which is the ISO technical committee concerned with the       maintenance and development of       gear related standards and between these, over 100 gear related standards       are currently being       maintained, reviewed and developed.
Frazer is the current chair of MCE/5       Gears, and of       MCE/5/-/2, the sub-committee concerned with gear accuracy.
Shaw Chairs       MCE/5/-/14, the gear       materials sub-committee and is a member of MCE/5/-/15, the micropitting       sub-committee.
BGA       Technical Executive (also Honorary Secretary to MCE/5) comments that (S1):     "Without the research contributions from the Design Unit, the UK would         be unable to validate and         contribute so effectively to the preparation of ISO/BS standards and         supporting technical reports."
The research activities undertaken at Newcastle University has enabled       staff to make significant       contributions in gear geometry measurement and calibration, and       micro-pitting and gear surface       engineering.
These contributions have underpinned the development of a       range of standards for       mechanical power transmissions which have either been in industrial use       over the entire REF       period, or have been established within the REF period.
4.1 Gear Geometry Measurement and Calibration     The research undertaken by Frazer to establish robust and consistent data       sampling strategies for       gear profile measurement have fed directly into:             ISO 18653: 2003 and 2009 Gears &#8212; evaluation of instruments for           measuring individual gears         (contribution: methods for gear machine calibration).
ISO TR 10064-3: 1996/2006 Code of inspection practice &#8212; Part 3:           Recommendations relative to           gear blanks, shaft centre distance and parallelism of axes         (contribution: methods for measuring         gear blanks and determining alignment tolerances).
ISO/TR 10064-5:2005/Cor 1:2006 Code of inspection practice &#8212; Part           5: Recommendations           relative to evaluation of gear measuring instruments         (contribution: gear machine calibration         methods and examples).
ISO/TR 10064-6:2009 Code of inspection practice &#8212; Part 6: Bevel           gear measurement methods         (contribution: gear measurement method and examples).
ISO 21771:2007 Gears &#8212; Cylindrical involute gears and gear pairs &#8212;           Concepts and geometry         (contribution: geometry calculation procedure and logic for specifying         gear geometry).
ISO 17485: 2003 Bevel gear accuracy (contribution: gear         measurement methods).
The key contributions of Frazer to these standards have been confirmed by       the Honorary       Secretary to MCE/5 (source S1 as listed in section 5), and the Chairman of       ISO/TC 60 (S2).
All of       these standards have been active over the entire REF period, with the       exception of ISO/TR 10064-       6 which has been active since 2009.
4.2 Micro-pitting and Gear Surface Engineering     Research undertaken by Shaw on micro-pitting has directly informed ISO         TR 15144-1:2010         Calculation of micro-pitting load capacity of cylindrical spur and         helical gears.
The Technical       Director of Allen Gears, also the Chairperson of ISO/TC60 SC1       sub-committee notes that (S3):     "It was only the physical testing and research conducted at Newcastle         University that allowed         certain elements of the standard to be developed.
In particular,         elements relating to key         influencing features and testing techniques were developed resulting         from specific Design Unit         contributions.
The BGA-DU micropitting test procedure developed by         Newcastle University is now         directly referenced in ISO TR 15144."
Design Unit also work closely with the MoD, and have supported the       development of a key defence       standard for ship gear systems: MOD UK DEF STAN 02-381: Requirements         for the Forging and         Heat Treatment of Main Propulsion Gears, 2009.
The Head of Gearing at Defence Equipment and Support, MoD (S4), notes       that Design Unit were       fully involved in the process of developing this standard and were able to       include newly developed       procedures within the standard, and specifically that this included "grinding         burn detection using         Barkhausen noise when inspecting gears, and improvements to fatigue life         of gears following shot         peening of tooth roots" and further notes that "both of these         procedures, although novel at the time         are now standard practices".
4.3 Industrial Significance     These standards are clearly policy impacts which underpin an industry       which within the UK has a       value in excess of &#163;200M annually to the UK economy (S1), with the annual       worldwide market       value estimated at over $5B (S6).
The standards are widely used and are       often mandatory within       supply contracts.
The Chief of Commodity Engineering, Drive Systems       Structures and       Transmissions Engineering at Rolls Royce (S5) notes that when designing       new gearing systems       for aerospace applications:     "the basis of our designs will still start with the fundamentals of         gear standardisation, an area         where Newcastle University, Design Unit research has been of critical         importance in the         development of the current range of gearing standards we utilise."
BGA Technical Executive, also Honorary Secretary to MCE/5 (S1), notes       that:     "the research output from Design Unit has supported, and continues to         support the development of         a wide range of gear standards that are used in nearly every mechanical         power transmission         application worldwide."
