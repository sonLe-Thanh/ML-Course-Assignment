     Around the world, structures are designed using codes of practice, with       the European and North American codes being the most widely adopted.
The       contents of these codes is typically controlled by a committee of experts       and informed by researchers.
Members of the Structures Section at Imperial       have had long standing involvements in such committees.
For example,       Professor Nethercot was Chair of the BSI (British Standards Institute)       Committee responsible for BS 5950 and the UK input into Eurocode 3,       Professor Elghazouli is the UK National Delegate of the International and       European Associations of Earthquake Engineering and Professor Gardner is a       member of the BSI Committee response for steel structures, the UK National       Delegate for the steel and stainless steel Eurocodes, and Chair of the UK       Mirror Group for the steel Eurocode.
Owing to their widespread use,       structural design codes represent the primary means of enabling research       to impact on practice.
Recent years have seen the introduction or major       revision of a number of international stainless steel design standards       underpinned by the establishment of a broad experimental database [F], and       substantial increases in the use of stainless steel in construction [H,I].
In this case study, it is explained how research conducted at Imperial has       made the most substantial contributions [A] to many of the recent       developments, particularly in relation to the UK, Europe and North       America, though Imperial research has also featured prominently in the       development of the upcoming Chinese design standard for stainless steel       [A].
The key impacts are summarised below:     UK and European design practice     Based directly on research at Imperial College, a range of improvements       have been made to key stainless steel design documents:            In the UK National Annex [B] to the stainless steel Eurocode,         published in 2009, Imperial research has enabled strength enhancements         that arise during the manufacture of cold-formed sections to be         harnessed and utilised in design, leading to more efficient structural         solutions.
The method is given in Section NA.3 of the National Annex and         is based on research reported in [5].
The method first considers the         plastic deformation that is induced during section forming, which         relates primarily to the geometry of the formed section, and then the         potential for strength enhancement of the material, which relates to the         ratio of ultimate to yield strength of the unformed sheet.
The outcome         from the method is an enhanced yield strength that can be used in         subsequent design calculations.
The level of enhancement therefore         depends upon the properties of the sheet material to be formed and the         geometry of the final section, but up to two-fold strength increases can         be achieved.
The continuous strength method [4], described further below, has been         published as a UK NCCI [C] in 2013.
NCCI refers to `Non-Contradictory         Complementary Information' and provides supplementary guidance to the         Eurocodes for structural engineers.
The CSM is already being used in the         construction industry [G,I], with an international stainless steel         producer (Ancon Building Products) noting the resulting `step-change'         (i.e.
substantial increase in design capacities of sections) in their         practice [G].
The first studies [2] to examine the structural performance of lean         duplex stainless steel were conducted at Imperial between 2009 and 2012,         and based on this work, an amendment to the stainless steel Eurocode to         cover this family of grades [D] has now been accepted by the European         code committee CEN TC250-SC3.
Two other key amendments arising directly         from Imperial research, covering cross-section classification and shear         buckling, were also accepted in 2012 [A,D].
North American design practice     A new design standard for stainless steel in North America &#8212; AISC Design       Guide 27 &#8212; Structural Stainless Steel [E] was published in 2013, prior to       which no guidance for hot-rolled or welded sections was available.
The       technical basis for this document is linked closely to that of Eurocode 3,       but the opportunity to include the findings of recent research has also       been taken.
Thus, the new code makes very extensive reference to the       stainless steel research conducted at Imperial and described in Section 2,       with approximately one third of the code references related to research       being made to the publications of Professor Gardner [A].
Directly based on       this research are the slenderness limits given in Tables 3.1 and 3.2 of       the code, the effective area formulae to account for local buckling given       in Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2, and the design rules specified in Section 9.3       for bolted connections [E].
A major innovation in the code is the       inclusion of Annex A &#8212; the continuous strength method, which is a new       design approach enabling the more efficient design of structural stainless       steel elements.
The method was developed by Professor Gardner [3,4] and       represents a significant departure from existing practice, allowing       enhanced member capacities [G] and a more accurate and consistent       representation of observed structural behaviour.
Beneficiaries     The durability and favourable mechanical properties of stainless steel       make it an ideal material for sustainable construction.
With the recent       emergence and developments of structural design codes, a growing awareness       among structural engineers and architects of its benefits and an       increasing availability of structural sections, the use of stainless steel       in construction is becoming increasingly widespread [H,I].
Clearly, the       research at Imperial [A] enables more efficient structural stainless steel       designs, bringing about cost savings [G], more widespread use of the       material [A,H,I] and a reduction in the use of resources to the benefit of       future generations.
The breadth of impact throughout the stainless steel       and structural engineering communities, including producers [H], code       writers [A] and practitioners [G,I], and global reach of the research,       with extensive influence on UK, European, North American and Asian       practice [A] have been demonstrated.
