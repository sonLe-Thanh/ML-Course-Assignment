     4a: Informed and affirmed NICE guidelines for CFS and ME     As a major recommendation within its guidelines, NICE recommends: "Cognitive         behavioural therapy and/or graded exercise therapy should be offered to         people with mild or moderate CFS/ME and provided to those who choose         these approaches, because currently these are the interventions for         which there is the clearest research evidence of benefit."
(page 30)       [7].
There have been no trials of GET in severe CFS/ME.
However, partly       because of an open study conducted at Queen Mary, showing that GET helps       severely disabled patients (Essame CS et al.
Journal of         Chronic Fatigue Syndrome 1998; 4: 51-60), NICE recommend an activity       management programme for such patients that "draws on the principles         of CBT and GET."
Since publication of the PACE trial in 2011, NICE       have publicly affirmed their recommendation of GET (and CBT) [8].
4b: Graded exercise therapy has been adopted as a standard treatment         for CFS in the UK     The British Association for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/ME (BACME) "champions         evidence-based approaches to the treatment of CFS/ME" and represents       clinicians of NHS specialist services in the UK [9].
BACME welcomed the       findings of the PACE trial saying: "The PACE trial ... provides         convincing evidence that GET and CBT are safe and effective therapies         and should be widely available for patients with CFS/ME."
BACME is supported by the National Outcomes Database [9], which holds       clinical assessment and outcome data on ~9,000 NHS patients, to allow       benchmarking of effectiveness.
Crawley and colleagues compared patient       outcomes across six of the largest NHS services against outcomes after       both CBT and GET in the PACE trial.
Three of the services used GET; three       used activity management incorporating the principles of GET.
Symptomatic       improvement was similar to that achieved after GET provided within the       PACE trial [10].
However, the mean improvement in physical disability was       about a quarter of the size achieved by GET in the trial, which may be       partly explained by the fidelity of the intervention not always being       optimal when implemented outside a trial setting.
One obvious difference       is that some services deliver interventions in a group setting, rather       than individually as in the trial [10].
4c: Graded exercise therapy has been adopted internationally as a         treatment of CFS     Permission has been granted for both translation into German and the use       of the PACE trial GET manuals for a trial in neuromuscular disease, and       for use in an Australian trial of rehabilitation for patients with       traumatic brain injuries.
The PACE trial treatment manuals are free to       download from the trial website: www.pacetrial.org/trialinfo.
The site was accessed by 6,672 people between June 2012 and 21 August       2013, particularly from the UK, USA, Australia, Germany, and Canada       (source &#8212; Google Analytics), this monitored period being more than a year       after the main results were published [11].
4d: Graded exercise therapy is included in guidelines for treatment of         CFS internationally     Guidelines published in other countries recommend GET.
For example:             In USA, the Mayo Clinic states: "The most effective           treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome appears to be a two-pronged           approach that combines psychological counseling with a gentle exercise           program."
[12]        Also in USA, the Centers for Disease Control recommend GET;         specifically White's clinical website: "The GET Guide 2008 by Chronic           Fatigue Syndrome/ME Service at St. Bartholomew's Hospital can be           helpful in structuring your graded exercise plan."
[13]        Australian clinical guidelines for ME/CFS recommend GET "unless           severely affected" [14]        The Norwegian Knowledge Centre for Health Services,         commissioned by their government, concluded: "Cognitive behavioural           therapy and graded exercise therapy is likely to be effective for           people with chronic fatigue syndrome."
[15]          4c: Engagement with `lay epidemiology' and improving public         understanding of science     This research succeeded in spite of considerable opposition from       activists.
Some people in the CFS/ME community have developed a `lay       epidemiology' comprising purely organic explanations and hypotheses for       the condition, and view psychological hypotheses as dismissive of       patients' `real' experiences.
A vocal minority has actively opposed any       research into this condition with a psychological component and has even       sought to sabotage such studies [16].
Pressure from such activists       (including threats of violence) has led some researchers to pull out of       researching CFS altogether.
The approach taken at Queen Mary, as described       in Section 2, has been to seek dialogue with patients, carers and the lay       public, engage with their concerns, try to understand their explanations       and seek as far as possible to work with them rather than against them.
CFS is so controversial that the House of Lords held a debate about the       PACE trial in February 2013 [17].
One peer was critical, but seven others       supported the trial.
Baroness Northover replied for the Government, and       later wrote to White: "PACE was an example of a well conducted, robust         research study.
It is with thanks to you and your team that we now have         some very good evidence that CBT and GET are moderately effective when         provided alongside specialist medical care."
[18] As part of a       public relations policy to disseminate the PACE trial results, The Science       Media Centre hosted a press conference for the main paper [19].
This led       to positive, world-wide coverage, including almost all UK national       newspapers as well as the New York Times, Wall Street Journal,       Sky, BBC, and ITV, and radio stations in the UK, USA and Australia.
