 	             By early 2008 the researchers had developed a prototype instrument (the       Skoog) that gave its users accessible expressive control over real       sounding instruments.
Drs.
Sch&#246;gler and Skulina then determined to form a       commercial company to bring the Skoog to market.
They raised &#163;400k       investment funds from the University of Edinburgh, Nesta, Scottish       Enterprise, Banwell plc and the Daedalus Investment Fund; Skoog music was       launched in early 2010.
Skoog website hits reached 85,000 and sales had       passed 1,000 (in 16 countries) by February 2013 (the end of the last       accounting period), by which point the company had taken on two further       full-time employees, a software engineer and an applications development       officer, and two part-timers.
Turnover in the 12 months preceding was       &#163;177,671.
In its commercially developed form, the Skoog is a musical       instrument based on a sensor covered with a coating which makes it       sensitive to touch but tough enough to resist strong handling.
The sensor       is linked to a computer, which takes in information about how slow or       fast, soft or hard, and from which direction the player is touching the       sensor.
In essence, there is a virtual instrument inside the computer.
The       Skoog has been programmed to produce the sound of a flute, trumpet, bowed       or plucked strings and clarinet, among other instruments.
It can be set       for different levels of ability or range of movement.
The great majority of sales have been to schools or education services.
Skoog use figures are therefore much higher than the sales figures.
The       instrument's general value for music education, in enhancing innovation       and creativity, was quickly picked up by both reviewers in the specialist       press and early customers, as is indicated in these comments:     `A fantastic product that shows real innovation and fun alongside its         more serious educational benefits.
One of the easiest five stars we've         given.'
(Able Magazine's `Best of Best' 2010) (5.1)     `The Skoog is an inspired and inspiring creation.'
(ICT       Development Officer, Fife Council) (5.2) The Skoog's impact has been       particularly significant for people working with children with specific       physical disabilities.
In the words of one customer:     `I am an HCPC registered Senior Music Therapist from Northern Ireland.
In my clinical work I address the development of children and         adolescents living with visual impairments, physical impairments and         complex needs.
Recently, I acquired a Skoog and it has quickly become an         asset in my music therapy instrument "tool-kit", providing an effective         means for shared communication.
The Skoog's touch-sensitive         responsiveness means that it can bypass some of the more stringent         physical playing demands made by conventional musical instruments.'
(5.3)     One of the Skoog's most important attributes is its versatility: it can       be used in all sorts of music education settings, and therefore makes a       major contribution to policies of inclusivity.
A review in the magazine, Special         Children, noted that:     `The Skoog makes music accessible to everyone.
It has transformed the         life of one young girl at our school in particular.
She is on the autism         spectrum, with limited speech.
However when she plays the Skoog, she         becomes graceful, confident and at ease with herself.
It's wonderful to         watch.'
(5.4)     In 2011, Skoogmusic donated two Skoogs for use at Athens Special Olympics       events, and set up a Skoog Zone in the delegates' area for trying out the       instruments.
Videos from the Skoogmusic website show many of the athletes       enjoying making music with the Skoogs (5.5).
Mary Mavis, Managing Director       of Special Olympics Europe/Eurasia, commented that `The Skoog is a       wonderful invention which is accessible to everyone and gives people with       disabilities of all ages an opportunity to express themselves and develop       new skills' (5.6).
The Skoog also featured prominently in a composition commissioned for the       2012 Cultural Olympiad.
The Skoog was one of three instruments developed       for use by disabled performers, which were the inspiration for and       centrepiece of Technophonia, a piece commissioned from Oliver       Searle by the Drake Music School Project.
The piece premiered in Queen's       Hall Edinburgh, and was performed in the South Bank Centre as part of the       London Olympics celebrations (5.7).
In an interview given while working on       the piece, Searle explained how experimenting with the Skoog and the other       two instruments shaped the process of composition.
In particular, he       enjoyed `being able to work hands on with the instruments, with the       sounds, that might give me ideas that I might use later in the piece'       (5.8).
The Southbank Centre website commented that the piece would `stir       their audience and stimulate them to think again about what is possible,       as well as how we define musical instruments and performing musicians.'
The piece has been short-listed for the 2013 British Composer Awards       (Community or Educational Project category).
