     Since 2008 the University of Nottingham's School of Chemistry has       undertaken a sustained       programme of public engagement, both through face to face events and via       the internet, to       communicate its world-leading research in nanoscience and materials for       energy applications.
The       team has been motivated by a desire to enable the public to debate       scientific issues of societal       importance, enthuse a sufficient number of school pupils to pursue careers       in science and       engineering to sustain our national infrastructure in the future and to       communicate new discoveries       for their inherent excitement.
The School's innovative use of online media has enabled it to share its       research with a global       audience via our award-winning YouTube channel, "The Periodic Table of       Videos" (PTOV) [5.1].

The       PTOV team is led by Professor Martyn Poliakoff CBE, FRS       (Research Professor of Chemistry, 1979-present), in collaboration with Dr       Samantha Tang (Public       Awareness scientist 2004-present) and journalist Brady Haran.
It is one of       the most popular       chemistry focused sites on the internet, with greater than 325,000       subscribers and 47.5 million       views and for this work Poliakoff was recognised with the 2011 Royal       Society of Chemistry Nyholm       Prize for Education.
This ground-breaking project has earned critical       acclaim and a wealth of       positive feedback has been recognised by awards from IChemE, Science (Science,       2011, 332,       1046) and a prestigious US Webby Award in 2012.
In the 2009 International       Review of UK       Chemistry Research "Chemistry for the next decade and beyond" it was       highlighted that by using       PTOV to communicate science to school age students "such an approach to       community outreach       was extremely cost effective, reaching more than a thousand individuals       per pound invested" [5.2].
We have regularly used this medium to communicate the School's research       with about a quarter of       the research staff contributing to the production of scientific videos.
The research topics on       `nanoscience' and `materials for energy applications' feature in some of       the series' highly popular       entries alongside videos that describe e.g.
research into chemical       knots, X-ray photon       spectroscopy of ionic liquids and self-optimised reactions.
Using the PTOV platform, Liddle has communicated his work on uranium       [3.6] through the videos       `New Uranium Bond' (60,000+ views) and `Magnetic Uranium' (105,000+).
These build on an       earlier clip, `Uranium' (399,000+), in which he describes the element's       general properties and       dispels some of the misconceptions surrounding it.
Other videos feature       Khlobystov's work with       C60 (`Buckyballs'; 70,000+) and graphene (`Graphene'; 44,000+) whilst the       use of scandium-based       metal organic frameworks for hydrogen storage [3.5] is included in a video       about Scandium       (107,000+).
The original `Uranium' video is one of 34 PTOV films used in       products supplied by       Pearson to support GCSE-level chemistry in around 600 schools in the UK.
Pearson UK's Senior       Manager (Science) has confirmed the "very positive feedback" generated by       PTOV, remarking:       "[Its] use added to the educational value and engagement for students."
[5.3]     The School of Chemistry team continually evaluate their outreach       activities and a study of 179       teachers and 229 students by Dr Andrew Clapham (UoN Department of       Education) further       highlighted PTOV's educational benefits [5.4].
The independent study noted       that 77% of students       associated uranium with nuclear energy before watching Liddle's New       Uranium Bond video,       whereas afterwards 84% associated uranium with chemical bonds.
Some 80% of       students said the       video had changed their understanding of uranium and related research.
Similarly a study of       teacher's use of PTOV showed more than 70% of those questioned used it in       lessons.
Interviews       and focus group data suggested it influenced teachers' subject content       knowledge (89%) and       pedagogical content knowledge (42%).
Clapham observed: "PTOV impacted both       on how teachers       taught and, crucially, their own fundamental conceptions of nanoscience       and materials."
In 2008, the School's research into metal organic frameworks [3.4] and       nanotubes [3.1] was       presented to thousands of visitors at the NanoWhat?
Totally Tiny       Technology exhibition.
This       event, organised by the East Midlands Development Agency (EMDA), ran for       17 days in       Nottingham, Leicester, Loughborough, Derby, Lincoln and Northampton.
More       than 24,000 people       - including nearly 1,300 pupils, most aged 11 to 13, from 40 schools -       attended.
Each schoolchild       was engaged for an estimated six hours, including follow-up work with a       special activity pack.
An       independent study [5.5] concluded the event "fully met the targets defined       by EMDA and       significantly exceeded the estimates for public participation... [and]       served as a valuable curriculum       enrichment opportunity for the schools that attended".
Several       accompanying short films, including       one in which Champness discussed his and Schr&#246;der's work on new materials       for hydrogen       storage, were shown to visitors and at participating schools and later won       the Best Corporate/Non-       Broadcast Programme prize at the Royal Television Society Midland Awards       [5.6].
`Wonder in Carbon Land', an exhibit designed to communicate the School's       development of       nanotubes [3.1, 3.2], used interactive displays to convey both simple       concepts (e.g.
bonding       between atoms) and complex ideas (e.g.
the laws of quantum mechanics) to a       range of audiences.
It debuted at the 2008 Royal Society Summer Exhibition (RSSE), which       attracted 4,323 attendees,       including 894 schoolchildren.
Feedback compiled by the Royal Society [5.7]       showed 86% of adult       visitors felt their interest in science increased as a result of the       exhibition, while 62% of school       pupils said the experience made them more interested in a career in       science.
The EPSRC's then       Public Engagement Manager subsequently invited the School to exhibit       `Wonder in Carbon Land'       at the 2008 British Science Festival, noting: "Your department is highly       successful in terms of       EPSRC-funded research and public engagement."
[5.8] Almost 29,000 people,       3,755 of them       schoolchildren aged eight to 16, attended the event, with feedback [5.9]       indicating 88% rated the       exhibits "excellent" or "good" in terms of their ability to educate or       inform.
In 2010 the EPSRC used       the exhibit again, this time at a showcase event for EPSRC staff.
At the 2012 RSSE Liddle presented `The Wonder of Chemistry', a series of       nine public lectures.
This allowed him to communicate his uranium research to a total audience       of around 750 people,       including more than 600 14-to-18-year-old students.
Some 80% of attendees       said their knowledge       increased as a result [5.7].
A video of the lecture [5.10] was later       posted on the Royal Society       website to sustain public engagement.
At the 2010 RSSE, which was attended       by almost 50,000       people, including more than 1,000 schoolchildren, the School's research       into novel hydrogen       storage materials [3.4] was part of the Diamond Light Source exhibit.
Champness's work on molecular networks [3.3] has also been a key       component of `Seeing the       Unseeable', a series of annual masterclasses to encourage students &#8212;       particularly those unable to       pursue higher education without support &#8212; to study science at degree       level.
Since 2008, 134       students have attended; 48 have applied to attend the University of       Nottingham, with 13 enrolling.
Feedback from the past four years [5.11] shows 83% felt the programme       raised their interest in       science, with comments including "It has encouraged me to go on to HE" and       "It has opened my       mind".
