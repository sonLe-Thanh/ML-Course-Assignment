     Haynes and Bradley have exploited their research on religious soft power       to enhance the wider public understanding of the impact of religion in       politics and international relations.
Their research findings have been       disseminated through various means including: broadcast and internet       dissemination, publishing ventures, and research seminars and conferences       open to the public.
CSRCC organised international conferences in June 2011, June 2012 and       January 2014.
Their collective aim was to examine the effects of religious       involvement in politics and international relations, with emphasis on       religious soft power.
CSRCC also organises regular research seminars and       workshops, open to LMU and external academics, policy-makers, NGO       activists and members of the public.
Research findings are disseminated       via: broadcast media, web-based media, blogs, scholarly publications and       public events.
Haynes also disseminates his research findings via specially commissioned       publications.
For example, at the behest of the United Nations Research       Institute for Social Development, Geneva, in 1995 he wrote a 17,500 word       Discussion Paper, `Religion, Fundamentalism and Identity.
A Global       Perspective'.
In 2013, Haynes wrote a 17,500 word Working Paper,       `Religious Actors at the United Nations', published by the Robert Schuman       Centre for Advanced Studies, European University Institute, Florence.
Haynes's research also has public impact via his role as sole consultant       for a major ITV series, `Faultlines', broadcast in 2003, featuring the       former Beirut hostage, John McCarthy.
`Faultlines', a series of six       programmes broadcast on primetime terrestrial television in the UK,       examined the complex relationship between religion, human development,       politics, and international relations in relation to six countries: USA,       Brazil, Russia, India, Iran, and Israel.
The series was released worldwide       on DVD in 2006.
(`Faultlines' review at:       http://www.worldcat.org/title/faultlines/oclc/63820201?ht=edition&amp;referer=di)     In August 2013 Haynes was approached by the Tony Blair Faith Foundation       to produce a series of three 20-minute videos for use in a new on-line       course aimed at `professionals' (`to help current and future leaders       explore the place of religion in the modern globalised world')       (http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/).
National and international impact of Haynes's research on `religious soft       power' is also evidenced by the numerous requests he receives &#8212; around a       dozen each year &#8212; to speak at various public events, organised by       universities, governments, think tanks, NGOs, and professional       organisations.
Such invitations provide in the following ways clear       evidence of the impact of Haynes' research on religion, politics and       international relations in general and religious soft power in particular.
First, they emphasise that Haynes is an internationally significant figure       on the basis of his research on religious soft power.
Second, the variety       of invitations that Haynes receives &#8212; from universities, governments,       think tanks, NGOs, and professional organisations &#8212; collectively indicate       the public impact of his research on religious soft power extends beyond       universities to a variety of international, non-academic contexts,       including: (1) a development association (2) a political science research       body (3) a foundation, (4) an NGO, and (5) a think-tank.
