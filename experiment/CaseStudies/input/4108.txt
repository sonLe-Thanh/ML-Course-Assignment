     The research of the team has contributed to changing conservation and         resource management practice and policy.
The HONOWHS Research Agenda       (O6), initiated by Downes, was one of the first produced for a WHS; it       informed the research strategy at the WHS and is implemented in parallel       with the Historic Scotland WHS Management Plan.
The HONOWHS Research Agenda has been disseminated widely (available on       the internet since 2005), has served as a model for subsequent Research       Agendas (eg.
Br&#250; na B&#243;inne (E1) and informed the Historic Scotland WHS       Management Plan 2008-2013 (E2).The use of archaeological research as a       tool for sustainable development in a WHS context is applicable worldwide,       as demonstrated by Downes' advisory role in this respect at Euracademy's 6th       Summer Academy `Culture and Sustainable Rural Development' Crete (2007),       in consultancy in Vega Islands WHS, Norway (2009) and for Corporaci&#243;n       Nacional Forestal de Chile on Easter Island WHS.
The emphasis on a WHS       landscape approach has had a significant impact through, e.g.
the       geophysical survey which provided a planning tool for WHS site and       landscape management, beneficiaries being Orkney Isles Council (OIC) and       Historic Scotland (HS).
WHS research was important in the revision of the       WHS buffer zones and fed into the OIC Supplementary Planning Guidelines       (2010) (E3).
The research impact of fieldwork in the WHS area has been intensive       locally and extensive internationally due to a major focus on public         engagement.
Users and beneficiaries include: community organisations       (e.g.
Orkney Archaeology Society); Orkney community (schools, college,       businesses); communities of interest world-wide (tourists, members of the       public interested in archaeology); universities (students and researchers,       particularly from UK and North America).
The media have covered the research extensively in numerous local,       national, international, specialist and non- specialist archaeology items.
The reach of the research is worldwide, with the Ness of Brodgar       excavation having the most tangible and greatest impact.
Since July 2011,       the web pages dedicated to the Ness of Brodgar excavation diary hosted on       the Orkneyjar website (E4) have attracted over 180,000 visits.
This       website is also a reliable measure of the effect of a BBC2 programme on       Ness of Brodgar `Orkney's Stone Age Temple, A History of Ancient Britain       Special', first broadcast on 1/1/2012 (c. 3 million viewers), with repeats       on 5/08/2012 and 17/02/2013, shown on Special Broadcasting Service,       Australia July 2012 and New Zealand television, October 2012.
Peaks of       visits to the website occurred after the BBC2 screening in January 2012,       with over 2,000 visits in the first hour after the programme and c. 6,000       hits in the first day (E5).
An interview with Card on 20th       February 2013 on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) of America Newshour,       screened across the USA, was watched by c. 3 million viewers; the PBS       website had a further 22,900 views of the programme in the first week,       plus c.2,500 views on YouTube.
The programme contributed to the busiest       day on Orkneyjar.com's Ness of Brodgar pages with 6,327 hits (11,780 hits       in the week after the broadcast).
During the six-week excavation season at       the Ness of Brodgar in 2011, there were c. 32,700 visits to the Orkneyjar       website, increasing to 44,570 in 2012 and 70,000 in 2013.
Media coverage       has also had the impact of increasing visitor numbers to the Ness of       Brodgar, which rose markedly from 5,750 in 2011 to 7,600 in 2012.
Evidence of the impact of this public engagement are the several hundreds       of web sites in which the Ness of Brodgar features in discussion (source:       Google).
The excavations at the Ness and Ring of Brodgar have enhanced       interpretation of the WHS, already featuring in guidebooks for Orkney e.g.
Monuments of Orkney: A Visitors Guide (Historic Scotland 2012); The Heart       of Neolithic Orkney Miniguide (Charles Tait 2013).
The impact of public       engagement and of the significance of the impact is furthermore apparent       in the awards to the Ness of Brodgar excavation: 2008 runner up,       International Andante Travel Archaeology Awards; 2009 recognised as one of       the top discoveries in the world by the American Institute of Archaeology;       2011 Current Archaeology Research Project of the Year; 2012       winner, International Andante Travel Archaeology Award; 2013 nominee,       International Educational Travel Community Award.
The WHS-focussed Art and Archaeology research strand has engendered new       types of creativity and knowledge, as well as engaging new audiences.
Collaboration between Pier Arts Centre (PAC) and Orkney College UHI &#8212; two       workshops (15/01/2010 OC, 30/04/2010 at PAC), and a follow-up workshop on       28/01/2011 at PAC to accompany `Test Trenches' exhibition at PAC brought       archaeologists and artists together in knowledge exchange.
This       collaboration led to Scotland's Islands Flagship Fund project `Symbols in       the Landscape: Art and Archaeology in Orkney's World Heritage Site',       funded a residency for Rik Hammond in 2012 at the Ness of Brodgar, and       subsequent exhibition at the Pier Arts Centre `Being and Remembering'       18/2/-17/3/2012 (E6).
Artist Philip Hughes drew inspiration from the WHS       geophysical and topographic survey, creating a body of drawings and       paintings exhibited widely including at the Francis Kyle Gallery, London       2010, and the PAC in June 2012, and featuring in a book `Tracks' (Tracks:         walking the ancient landscapes of Britain Thames and Hudson 2012)       accompanied by a touring exhibition of UK.
The Orkney WHS research has made a significant positive contribution         to cultural, environmental and economic sustainability.
In the       remote rural context of Orkney "[w]ith tourism one of Orkney's major         industries the importance of excavations such as the Ness of Brodgar to         the local economy cannot be overstated."
(Orkney Archaeology Tours)       (E7).
"Tourism is vital to Orkney's economy, and the publicity         generated by the [Ness of Brodgar] excavation in both the         national and international news media is extremely beneficial."
(Orkney Tourist Guides Association).
Several Orkney-based tour operators       reported a large increase in enquiries and bookings, one reporting a 700%       increase (from 30 to 250) in daily web page visits following the BBC2       broadcast in January 2012; another (Orkney Archaeology Tours) reporting       400% increase website hits following the February 2013 broadcast (E7).
The       VisitOrkney website recorded a 200% increase in visits in the first week       after the BBC2 Ness of Brodgar broadcast in January 2012, and VisitOrkney       is in "no doubt the publicity generated by the Ness of Brodgar, with         the BBC and other channels has raised the profile of Orkney as a         destination and attracted additional visitors" (E8).
The impact of       the research on the sustainability of Orkney is further affirmed by       Highlands and Islands Enterprise: "the tourism industry is extremely         supportive of the work of the archaeology department, recognising its         importance in bringing Orkney to the attention of a worldwide audience."
(E9).
Moreover, the significance of the Ness of Brodgar research and its       impacts were highlighted in a motion proposed by Liam McArthur MSP in the       Scottish Parliament, on 1 March 2011 "That the Parliament notes that         on-going excavations on the Ness of Brodgar....[have won several       awards and ]..believes that the complex uncovered by the excavations is         further evidence of the rich archaeology of Orkney, both in the heart of         Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site and across the islands" (E10).
