     Ahmed is co-editor of a public online database and co-curator of a       touring panel exhibition which are designed to promote awareness and       understanding of the historic contribution of South Asians to British life       and culture since 1870.
The database Making Britain: Discover How         South Asian Shaped the Nation, 1870-1950 is one of a number of       outcomes from an AHRC funded project (Principal Investigator, Professor       Susheila Nasta, Open University) which investigated South Asian       contributions to Britain's literary, cultural and political life during an       under-explored period of migration.
Since her appointment to Teesside       University in 2011, Ahmed has contributed eight new articles to the       database (Anjuman-i-Islam; Chirag Din Chohan; Ghulam Sarwar Khan Chohan;       Inauguration of East London Mosque; Khwaja Kamaluddin; Paradise Caf&#233;       Restaurant; William H. Quilliam; Taslim Ali) [5:2].
Ahmed is co-curator of       an accompanying touring panel exhibition, "South Asians Making Britain,       1858-1950", which has been hosted at a range of locations across the UK,       including the British Library; Ahmed arranged for the exhibition to visit       North East England and presented a curator's talk for a public audience       during its residency at Middlesbrough Central Library (October 2011).
Ahmed has collaborated with regional and national cultural organisations       and public bodies to convene a range of events for public audiences and       schools; these events have brought new audiences and readers to the work       of contemporary writers of Muslim heritage, with a specific focus on       developing audiences and reader communities in North East England.
In June       2012 Ahmed convened and chaired a poetry reading and panel discussion       event, "Three British Poets of Muslim Heritage: Moniza Alvi, John       Siddique, Shamshad Khan;" this event was part of the annual Middlesbrough       Literary Festival programme, organized by Middlesbrough Central Library       and funded by Middlesbrough Council.
In October 2012 Ahmed convened and       chaired a public reading and panel discussion event, "Writing from a       Muslim Perspective: Selma Dabbagh, Aamer Hussein, Mirza Waheed" at the       Durham Book Festival, an annual event produced by New Writing North (the       writing development agency for North East England) for Durham County       Council and supported by Durham University and Arts Council England.
In       October 2012 Ahmed convened educational visits to two north east school       primary schools (Stanley Burnside Primary School and South Hetton Primary       School) by Wendy Meddour, author of the Cinnamon Grove children's book       series, which explore the lives of two British Muslim families.
These       activities were organized in association with the Durham Book Festival and       New Writing North.
Ahmed is Online Reviews Editor for Wasafiri Extra, an open access       website which provides access to original content, including reviews of       new writing and 'Summer Reads' and 'Christmas List' recommendations.
This       site is affiliated to Wasafiri:The Magazine of Contemporary Writing,       a publication dedicated to the promotion of contemporary international       writing [5:3].
Ahmed is co-author of two articles published by the open       access Huffington Post online: "Muslims Protest Against H. G. Wells Book       in 1930s Britain" (with Stadtler, 19 September 2012) [5:4] and "Literary       Controversies Since the Rushdie Affair" (with Chambers, 20 September 2012)       [5:5].
These articles were written to coincide with the publication of       Salman Rushdie's memoir Joseph Anton and served to foster and       inform public debate about religious minority protests against creative       works [5:6].
The following research beneficiary testimonies provide evidence of the       impact of this research:            Selected comments from audience evaluation questionnaire (South           Asians Making Britain, 1858-1950, exhibition and talk, 2011):         "Very useful information"; "Interesting snapshots of research"; "The         website is going to be a good research source"; "Very interesting and         informative.
New information for me about participation in war and         political activities"; "Enjoyed it very much.
I look forward to         exploring the Open University website."
An audience member described the         talk as an "excellent and thought provoking event" in an online blog         entry [5:6].
Development and Operations Manager, Middlesbrough Library Service (South           Asians Making Britain, 1858-1950, exhibition and talk, 2011 /         "Three British Poets of Muslim Heritage", Middlesbrough Literary         Festival, 2012): "Middlesbrough Library Service initially worked with         Rehana Ahmed to celebrate Black History Month in 2011.
Prior to this,         the service had only been able to promote the month with limited         activities, such as displays and book lists, however Rehana's touring         panel exhibition and talk, generated a lot of interest within the local         community, and we know that people visited the library, specifically to         see the display, and listen to the talk &#8212; some of whom had not         previously visited the library.
The Library Service received such         positive feedback about the event, that [the] Adult Services Manager and         Literary Festival Organiser, was keen for Rehana to revisit the library         during the 2012 Literary Festival, at which Rehana contributed a talk         entitled "Three British Poets of Muslim Heritage: Moniza Alvi, John         Siddique, Shamshad Khan".
This was again a successful event, again         enabling the library service to reach a wider audience.
We would very         much like to work together with Rehana in the future."
Moniza Alvi (Author and panel member, "Three British Poets of Muslim         Heritage", Middlesbrough Literary Festival, 2012): "The event was a         brilliant and unusual opportunity for me to read with two other poets of         Muslim heritage and to reflect, with the audience, on our different         worlds and cultural backgrounds.
.
.
.
As well as enjoyable, I feel such         events with readers who really do speak to each other in this way are         important for cultural understanding.
It would be marvellous to have         more of them."
Programme Manager, Festivals and Events, New Writing North ("Writing         from a Muslim Perspective", Durham Book Festival, 2012): "Drawing upon         Rehana's expertise to programme this event at the [Durham Book]         festival, helped us to bring a range of new authors to the festival and         hopefully allowed us to introduce their work to new readers as well as         existing fans of their work.
The event, which was for an audience of 30         people, sold-out very quickly, demonstrating the high-level of interest         it generated in our festival visitors; anecdotal feedback from audience         members was also positive.
The popularity of this event means that New         Writing North will certainly consider programming events with a similar         theme in future."
Wendy Meddour (Author, educational visits, Durham Book Festival,         2012): "My trip to Durham &#8212; and the school visits organised by Rehana         Ahmed &#8212; gave me a wonderful opportunity to meet (and enthuse) children         from very deprived areas.
Many of them had never met an author, and it         was touching to experience their excitement.
It was also great fun to         help them realise their own creative potential.
As it was a         predominantly white area, the school visits were also an opportunity to         introduce the children to the other cultures (largely Muslim) presented         in my books (A Hen in the Wardrobe and The Black Cat           Detectives).
They responded extremely well and we had a lot of fun         discussing characters, playing with plot and hopefully dismantling         prejudice!"
Selma Dabbagh (Author and panel member, "Writing from a Muslim         Perspective", Durham Book Festival, 2012): "I am a British Palestinian         writer of fiction and spoke at the event about my first novel, Out           of It.
.
.
I shared a panel with the British Kashmiri writer,         Mirza Waheed and the British Pakistani writer Aamer Hussein, neither of         whom I knew before the event.
Our styles of writing were very different         from each other, but there were thematic similarities that Rehana drew         out and our works complemented each other well.
It was an unusual         experience for me as a writer (and as an individual) to be presented         under the heading of a 'Muslim' writer, coming from a very secular         background, but Rehana encouraged me to participate in the panel despite         my reservations.
I believe that it was correct to do so, for it is as         important to show the diversity of approaches that can fall under the         heading, as the rejection of a particular religious heritage is as         important in showing the variety found in the 'Muslim world' as well as         those who define themselves by the title in a more devout way.
Much of a         writer's job is to dismantle stereotypes and panels such as the one I         participated in in Durham went some way to bringing the diversity of         voices found in the Muslim world to new yet curious audiences.
The         questions were thoughtful and the event was respectful and enjoyable.
.
.
it was great to work with Rehana who was extremely thorough in her         reading and understanding of our work and conscientious in her         presentation of us."
