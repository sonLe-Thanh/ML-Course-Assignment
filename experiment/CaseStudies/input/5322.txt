The Imperial research described has       allowed early detection of cardiac iron overload in TM major patients       which has been incorporated into national and international guidelines.
Follow-up of the UK cohort of TM patients (which represents 97% of the TM       population in the UK) has shown a 71% reduction in mortality since the       introduction of T2* CMR operating in concert with targeted cardiac iron       chelation.
This is related to earlier detection of cardiac iron overload       and improved treatment, which prevents the onset of heart failure that is       associated with a very high mortality rate [1].
A significant reduction in       mortality associated with the use of cardiac T2* CMR has been published       that is independent of Imperial College in Greece, Cyprus, Italy and Hong       Kong.
Large studies internationally have demonstrated that the use of       deferiprone is associated with lower rates of cardiac death and       complications.
This confirms the population effect of the cardioprotective       nature of deferiprone first demonstrated in our randomised controlled       trial [2-3].
Consequently, cardiac T2* is cited as pivotal to the management of TM       patients in four international sets of guidelines.
The guidelines       published by the Thalassemia International Federation describe T2* as the       standard method for effectively and rapidly assessing cardiac iron levels       [4; see page 40] to determine the course and intensity of treatment [4;       see page 49).
The UK specific guidelines also state that all patients       should have access to T2* MR imaging modalities for monitoring myocardial       and liver iron [5; see page 3].
Children with cardiac complications should       have the myocardial iron monitored by cardiac T2* from the age of eight,       with cardiac T2* maintained at &gt;20 milliseconds by the appropriate       adjustment of chelation therapy [5; see page 5].
The Italian guidelines       also state that cardiac T2* should be monitored in patients with a poor       chelation history [6; see page 747].
US guidelines are currently in press       which will also incorporate the use of cardiac T2* [7].
All the guidelines       above reference the research of Professor Pennell and colleagues.
Cardiac T2* has been installed in &gt;100 centres worldwide, with       calculations suggesting that there is potential for 30,000 lives per year       to be saved if universal access to T2* and appropriate treatment can be       achieved.
Worldwide survey of cardiac T2* at these centres shows that 42%       of TM patients have cardiac iron overload [8].
Furthermore, the Summary of Product Characteristics for deferiprone was       amended by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2011 to indicate that       deferiprone use was associated with a lower mortality [9].
The mortality       and cardiac data for deferiprone were used to gain approval for       deferiprone from the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) in 2011 [10].
The FDA is requiring new chelators (such as deferasirox) to show cardiac       efficacy through T2* as part of their assessment program (Novartis,       ApoPharma, AMAG, Shire).
Commercial benefits:     An Imperial spin out company named CVIS has been created to commercialise       cardiac T2* analysis software.
Magnetic resonance T2* sequences and analysis software have been       developed by Siemens, Philips and GE.
Siemens state that the availability       of T2* MR has been instrumental to the sale of scanners in some regions.
ApoPharma's drug Deferiprone has had a significant increase in sales and       has become profitable (letters available upon request from Siemens and       Apopharma).
