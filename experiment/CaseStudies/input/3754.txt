     Ramage's innovations in synthesis and purification of long polypeptides       rapidly established       Albachem as a world leader in the supply of chemically synthesised       immunomodulatory proteins.
The subsequent synthesis of biologically active peptides that afforded       insights into the structure-       function relationships of antimicrobial peptides [3], cytokines [4], and       the ubiquitination process [5]       demonstrated to the world the usefulness of Albachem's procedures.
The       Almac group (at that       time CSS) noticed Albachem's success and recognising the future earnings       potential, acquired       Albachem - thus taking a "quantum leap into protein synthesis".
[S1] "The         Albachem acquisition         allowed Almac to add very significant synthetic chemistry expertise to         its core competencies and,         critically, to establish a position at the interface between chemistry         and biology.
Access to         Ramage's innovations transformed [Almac's] market differentiation by         allowing provision of         specialist services to its clients worldwide with a focus on the         pharmaceutical industry".

Economic:     The skills and expertise resident in Albachem and derived from Ramage's       original research, were       key [S3] to the Almac group's subsequent success in worldwide protein and       peptide sales (&gt; &#163;6M       revenue in REF period attributed to the technology described in Professor       Ramage's papers, not       including revenue generated through Almac's GMP capability that was built       on technical expertise       flowing from Albachem[S4]).
Elaboration of the methodologies described in       Section 2 for the       chemical synthesis of long polypetides allows Almac to produce proteins in       high yield and purity.
Almac has made over 7000 peptides.
Almac can also make polypeptides with       non-natural amino       acids that offer new research avenues to their customers.
They specialise       in chemically       synthesised cytokines.
There are &gt;60 of these in their catalogue with       biotinylation and site-specific       fluorescent labelling or PEGylation available.
"A legacy of a research         focus developed at ...         Edinburgh and in Albachem is our ongoing development of protocols for         synthesis of chemokines...         As well as being long polypeptides, chemokines are challenging to         manufacture because they         contain ... cysteines that form disulfide bridges following oxidation.
Starting from methods that are         founded on Ramage's original technologies, we have robust laboratory         protocols that have been         applied to several GMP campaigns on a range of chemokine products."
[S4] In effect, Albachem       became the specialist R&amp;D arm of the Almac group that offers protein       and peptide services.
"it is         easy to trace a clear pathway from research carried out in Professor         Ramage's lab in the early         1990s, through the spinning out of Albachem and its eventual acquisition         by Almac, to significant         past, present and future economic and health benefit impacts".
[F1]     Almac is nowadays a global-reach company with 3300 staff (2000 in UK) and       a &#163;300M turnover       with &#163;14.3M profit in 2012 and total profits 2008-12 of &#163;55M based on       sales to 600 companies       including all the market leaders.
Peptide-based therapeutics represents       the fastest-growing class       of new drugs, accounting for ~2% of drugs on the market, but comprisin&#285;50%       of drugs in the       pipelines of major drug manufacturers.
The market for peptide drugs is       growing by 7.5% annually       and will be more than $13 billion this year.

Human Capital:     A total of 14 Almac employees (eight PhD level) remain in Gladsmuir, East       Lothian, Scotland, while       large-scale GMP polypeptide manufacture occurs in a dedicated facility       established (2006) by       Almac in Craigavon, employing a further 14 people.
In the REF period "we         have trained many         chemists in peptide synthesis, in both full-time appointment and on         placements generating         significant human capital contribution to the economy".
[F1]     If it were not for Ramage's pioneering work with Tbfmoc, Almac &#8212; who       employ people around the       world &#8212; would have looked overseas when it chose to buy into the protein       synthesis business.
They       may have not been able to make such rapid inroads into the market and       certainly would not be       employing any researchers in Scotland.
Impact Development Timeline:     1994 Albachem spun out from Ramage's research.
Distinguishes itself by       its unique capacity to       produce cytokines.
2002 Current Operations Manager (PhD, University of Edinburgh 1995) joins       Albachem.
2004 CSS/Almac acquires and expands Albachem.
[S3]     2005 The Almac Group further expands peptide synthesis efforts,       introduces GMP.
2006 Almac establishes a dedicated facility in Craigavon, employing a       further 14 staff.
2007 Almac announces' `First in Man' approach to peptides, embraces       development of peptide       synthesis, full analytical support, and GMP [batch production, and CMC       (Chemistry,       manufacturing and controls) documentation].
[S1]     2008 The current Almac Operations becomes Senior Group Leader in protein       synthesis at       Almac.
[S4]     2013 Almac is fully established as a global-reach company with 3300 staff       (2000 in UK), &#163;275M       turnover and &#163;15M profit.
