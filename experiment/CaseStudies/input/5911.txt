     MacKay's introduction to Lanchester combat models [1] has proven       useful to a number of military analysts, from the US Army, the (US) Air       Force Institute of Technology and Air Combat Command [6] and the       Australian Defence Science &amp; Technology Organization [7], and in MS or       PhD theses at the US Naval Postgraduate School [8], Canadian Forces       College [9] and by a USAF Operations Analyst [10].
It is also used in       teaching SM212 Differential Equations, taught 2008-13 by Prof. W.       D. Joyner and subsequently Prof. R. L. Jackson, at the US Naval Academy,       to a class of around 400 midshipmen, where its notation was adopted and       its text heavily quoted (Prof. Jackson commented [11] that [1] `said it       much better than I could').
The mixed-forces paper [2] has been used (as       `the latest Lanchester mixed forces model') by analysts from Taiwan [12].
The Battle of Britain work [3,4] has been presented to mixed audiences       from defence and industry, including serving ranking officers, at Mathematics         in Defence 2009 (by MacKay, at QinetiQ, Farnborough) and Historical         Analysis for Defence and Security (by Price, at DSTL Portsdown West,       2011).
More significantly, it has been used at the US Naval Postgraduate       School (NPS), as follows.
The US Navy is one of the largest technological military organizations in       the world, larger than the next ten navies combined.
The NPS operates more       widely, as `America's national security research university', and is the       world-leader in dynamic combat modelling.
It has about 2500 students on       2-year master's programmes, mostly mid-career officers from the armed       forces of the USA and its allies taking sabbaticals before returning to       front-line service.
Within the NPS, MOVES (MOdeling, Virtual Environments       and Simulation) `is the nation's institute for defense modeling and       simulation ... in support of all the services and our allies.'
Prof. T. W. Lucas teaches OA/MV 4655, Joint Combat Modeling, for       which [3] has become compulsory reading.
MacKay visited the NPS in       2011 for collaborative work with Profs.
M. Kress, R. Szechtman and M.       Atkinson on the dynamics of insurgency and to give an invited guest       lecture on [3,4] entitled Safety in Numbers: Lanchester, Fuller and         the Big Wing (Thurs 28 July 2011), attendance at which was       compulsory for OA/MV 4655 students.
The total audience was about 100,       composed of mixed faculty and students.
Thus MacKay's work is       informing and influencing the thinking of a wide range of mid-career       officers, the purpose of whose study at the NPS is precisely to develop       their operational thinking.
The impact here is in this knowledge transfer,       via the development of officers' understanding of combat dynamics before       their return to operational practice.
Most recently the historical air combat analysis of [3,4,5] was       referenced in a talk [13] on Prediction, given by Wayne Hughes,       the NPS's Professor of OR Practice, whose Fleet Tactics is `said       to be in every wardroom afloat' (ORMS Today, August 2007).
This       lecture was Keynote Speech at the Military Applications Society 2012       conference, the annual meeting of the military operational analysis       practitioner community.
Hughes called [3-5] a `detailed recent analysis       [whose conclusions are] no theoretical matter'.
Brian McCue, senior       analyst at the US Center for Naval Analyses and field representative at       the US Fleet Forces Command (which controls around 200 ships and 1000       aircraft), has described the results of [5] as `a severe strike against       the operational utility of [Lanchestrian] theory [for] the operational       planner' [14].
Countering the belief that Lanchester's square law applies       to air power will remain important for as long as planners continue to use       it in support of their theses, as for example in [10].
MacKay, Price and Wood have been formally invited [15] to visit       the NPS in 2013-14 to present and discuss their new work on naval       simulations, and have a standing invitation from Profs Kress and Lucas to       present their work in the Naval Postgraduate School Combat Modeling and       Advanced Combat Modeling courses.
Finally, MacKay has presented his warfare modelling work widely       in public engagement, giving presentations about the Battle of Britain       research for the Further Mathematics Support Programme, to the National       Mathematics Teachers' Summer School (of about 30 school mathematics       teachers from across the UK), and locally at various schools, societies       and open days.
The work has also been featured in New Scientist       [16].
Most recently MacKay and Wood, together with       historians Chris Price and Ian Horwood, organized a half-day event       (25-6-2013), with lectures and wargames/simulations, on mathematics in       First World War naval tactics and the Battle of Jutland as part of the York         Festival of Ideas [17].
