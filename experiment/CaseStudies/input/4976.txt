     Smith has played an important role in the historical development of the       distinctively English       tradition of politically engaged artists' film, and in the increasing       world-wide appreciation       for that tradition.
Using the ideas of structural materialism, yet       fascinated by the everyday       and by the power of film narrative and spoken word, he has developed a       body of work       which transforms reality, playfully exploring and exposing the language of       cinema.
Hotel Diaries has been applauded for its use of banal objects and       interiors to explore and       analyse violent conflicts and media-transmitted political reality.
Writing       in Sight and Sound       (2008), Ian Christie noted that:     `Nothing in John Smith's long career as Britain's wittiest maker of         avant-garde         films suggested that he would turn his deadpan gaze on the plight of the         Palestinian people, yet this is the theme that slowly comes to dominate         the diary         pieces that Smith made during his travels around film festivals.
Shandy-esque         observations on his immediate surroundings gradually turn into a         sustained         reflection on what it would be like to be trapped in Palestine.
Finally,         Smith finds         himself in Israel, able to see the territory that has begun to obsess         him.
A         deeply engaging work that provokes an unexpected comparison with the         master         of oblique polemic, Chris Marker' [a].
Similarly, Maximilian Le Cain, in Film Ireland Magazine (2008)       commented that:     `...these deceptively unassuming works consist of single takes from         the point of         view of Smith's camcorder as he explores the nocturnal spaces of hotels         he is         staying in and delivers monologues on his thoughts and observations.
At         once         politically concerned and very funny, these brilliantly structured         ramblings         connect the observations of his surroundings with the horror of world         events in         consistently surprising ways' [b].
Hotel Diaries' inclusion in major international film festivals and       exhibitions demonstrates       the reach of Smith's research since 2008: the many museums, galleries and       arts       institutions in which his work has been shown around the world have been       key       beneficiaries of his research.
It has featured in 7 solo exhibitions       (Kestnergesellschaft,       Hanover (22/2-29/4/12); Grand Hotel Atlantic, Bremen (4 &amp; 18/2/12),       Pallas Projects,       Dublin (2/3-3/4/11), Kunstbunker, Nuremberg (30/9-7/11/10), Tanya Leighton       Gallery,       Berlin (12/6-24/7/10), Royal College of Art Galleries, London       (19/3-13/4/10)[6] and Sala       Diaz Gallery, San Antonio (26/2-28/3/10); in 11 group shows (Dorothea       Schlueter       Gallery, Hamburg (15/2-16/3/13), Site Gallery, Sheffield (13-17/6/12),       Haus der Kunst,       Munich (10/6-26/9/12)[3], ZKM Museum of Contemporary Art, Karlsruhe       (17/9/11-19/2/12)[4],       Israeli Center for Digital Art, Holon (19/11/11-4/2/12), Mathildenh&#246;he,       Darmstadt (27/3-24/7/11), Independent Art Fair, New York (3-6/3/11),       National Gallery of       Art, Vilnius, (15/10-19/12/10), KW Institute for Contemporary Art, Berlin       (11/6-8/8/10),       Kunsthalle, Basel, (28/3-24//5/10) and TR1 GalleryTampere (8/2-9/3); and       in 35 solo         international festival and cinema screenings [c].
The impact of Hotel Diaries is further demonstrated through       Smith's involvement in 23         international symposia, conferences and artists' talks that have       stimulated debates       about issues of aesthetics, fiction and censorship in media       representations of conflict.
The       work has been programmed in exhibitions addressing the artistic and         media         representation of conflict, many of which have reached wide public       as well as art-professional       audiences.
These have included Image Counter Image (Haus der       Kunst,       Munich, 10/06-16/09/12) [d]; The Global Contemporary: Art Worlds after         1989 (ZKM,       Museum of Contemporary Art, Karlsruhe, 17/09/11-05/02/12) [e]; and Serious         Games: War         Media Art (Institut Mathildenhohe, Darmstadt, 27/03-24/07/11).
Although audience demographics are not precise, feedback from the artist       indicates       interesting exchanges and lively discussions with participants reflecting       localised       concerns.
For example, an audience in South Korea discussed military       tensions with North       Korea, while an online conversation with an Israeli curator explored       boycott and the impact       of Britain's foreign policy [g].
Furthermore, Hotel Diaries has generated         32 articles,         interviews, reviews and essays in print, online and many radio broadcast         in UK and         internationally [b, f, g, h].
Audiences can access Smith's work on       DVD [1, above] or via       online platforms such as TankTV and Lux Online.
The series was       included in Tate's       collection in 2010 [f] and bought by Wolverhampton Art Gallery in 2013       thereby ensuring       its wide public accessibility.
This widespread showing of Smith's work has encouraged a resurgence of       interest in a       genre that tests the limits of documentary and fiction, supporting new       forms of artistic       expression that engage audiences with complex socio-political topics via       its sophisticated       yet apparently artless aesthetic.
Smith's work has also had important       impacts on teaching       and research at HEIs within and beyond the UK, as the next generation of       curators, critics       and artists continue to be inspired and influenced by his work [g, j].
In       2010 students of the       Royal Academy's MA Curating Contemporary Art programme organised the       largest       exhibition to date of Smith's work and the first solo show curated by       students in the MA's       20-year history [g].
