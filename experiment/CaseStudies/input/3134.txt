     The impact of the public-history research activity undertaken is       reflected in positive influence within       three broad areas: in civil society, through forming and influencing       associations between       individuals and groups, as well as their values and assumptions; in       cultural life, by developing       forms of cultural capital held by people, communities and institutions;       and in education, by       influencing the development of good practice in learning resource creation       and use.
Prominent and       tangible types of impact include: preserving, conserving and presenting       cultural heritage;       contributing to processes of commemoration; and supporting the design of       curriculum delivery       through the development of IT resources for educational purposes.
These       three areas of impact       and impact types have been achieved through four clearly defined, and       public or privately funded,       projects and their related engagement activities:     Devon History and Heritage Online project commenced as a pilot in 2006 to       mark the 100th       anniversary of the publication of the Devonshire Victoria County History.
The project, becoming       Devon History Online from 2008, was funded by Devon County Council       (&#163;25,000), would seek new       ways of publishing the county's history through digitising and       web-publishing a great volume of       primary sources relating to coastal and market towns, held primarily in       central repositories based in       Exeter.
The design of the website encompassed a place-promotional heritage       agenda, and also       the design of interactive resources for use by schools.
Ilfracombe, as the       pilot case, and site of       state-assisted economic and cultural regeneration, became a particular       focus of attention.
Ermine Estate e-Archive project is the result of a partnership with St       John the Baptist Parish       Church, Ermine, Lincoln, from 2008.
The project has been concerned with       collecting, collating,       preserving, conserving and publishing a rare and unusual council estate       community archive held at       the church on behalf of the estate.
The content of a neighbourhood       newspaper, the Ermine News,       has been identified as being of particular significance.
The work of the       project and on the archive       has marked the 60th anniversary of the start of the       construction of the estate, and the 50th       anniversary of the building of the church.
Outputs of the project       partnership have included the       digitisation of the entire archive in 2009 (funded by the Skills for       Sustainable Communities Lifelong       Learning Network, &#163;15,000, and Diocese of Lincoln Quarry Trust, &#163;1,000),       the public hosting of the       material in an e-archive on the church's website, the production of a new       local history of the estate       and church, local exhibitions in the library and church, and the       production of learning resources for       schools.
The Lincolnshire Cooperative e-Archive was created to mark the 150th       anniversary of the Society.
A project was commissioned by the Coop (&#163;15,000) in 2009 to conserve and       preserve the original       copies of a substantial part of the Society's archive.
The project also       digitised and webhosted       those archives for public and popular access, given their significance for       the lay and professional       study of the development of Lincoln and Lincolnshire in modern times, and       for the history of the       cooperative movement nationally.
The Survey of Lincoln commenced in 1999, and is a project part-funded by       the City of Lincoln       Council, and bringing together local government officers, academics and       local historians.
The tasks       of the Survey team are primarily to produce a multi-volume set of       publications of the history and       heritage of the city aimed at a general and popular readership, with       supporting talks and events.
An important agenda item has been that of producing histories of       twentieth-century districts of the       city, off the heritage trail but subject to environmental decline and       regeneration.
This author is a       committee member and has been responsible for producing chapters on three       of the city's council       estates in 2009, 2010 and 2013.
Progress made by the four projects, and related underpinning research,       has been reported through       various media aimed at general, popular and professional audiences and       readerships from 2008.
Public lectures have been given to the Association for Local History       Tutors (2008), Branston U3A       (2012), British Association for Local History (2010), City of Lincoln       Council's Historic Environment       Advisory Panel (2012), Ingham History Group (2012 and 2013), Lincoln Book       Festival (2009),       Lincoln Rotary Club (2012), Lincolnshire Heritage Consortium (2009),       Society for Lincolnshire       History and Archaeology (2010 and 2012), The Lincolnshire Archives (2010),       The Survey of       Lincoln (2009 and 2010), Sleaford Museum Trust (2009), and West Lindsey       U3A (2012).
In       addition, two national events were staged to mark the work of these       projects.
In 2010 a conference       was organised in partnership with the University of Lincoln, British       Association for Local History       (&#163;1,000 grant funding) and Society for Lincolnshire History and       Archaeology on `Researching and       writing local histories of the twentieth century'.
In 2011, a conference       was organised in partnership       with the University of Lincoln, `The history and heritage of post-war       council estates: exploring       landscapes and culture', attended by academics, and officers of local,       central and non-governmental       agencies.
The work of the projects has also been disseminated through a       number of       published outputs aiming also at a general and popular, as well as an       academic, readership:       chapters in books published by the Society for Lincolnshire History and       Archaeology (2011) and       The Survey of Lincoln project (2009, 2010 and 2013); and articles in Devon         &amp; Cornwall Notes &amp;         Queries (2008), Family and Community History (2010), Lincolnshire         Past and Present (2012 and       2103), Local History News (2012), The Lincoln Enquirer       (2012) and The Local Historian (2008).
