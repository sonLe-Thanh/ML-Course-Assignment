     Humberstone has focused on developing theory-based practice in outdoor       education, linking the educational theoretical dimensions of outdoor       learning with nature-based sport.
The NFE project provided the impetus and theoretical underpinning that       drew together practitioners and academics to create a Non-Formal       Educational Framework (NFEF) which constitutes the main element of a       European Training Centre of Excellence within the European Institute of       Outdoor Adventure Education and Experiential Learning (EOE).
The NFE       collaboration included 18 partners from 12 European countries, mostly       practitioners, and attracted 250,000 Euros from EC funding.
Dialogue and       research into needs and good practice was undertaken by partners overseen       by Humberstone and Festeu and outputs from the project included a set of       resources aimed at enhancing professional practice and influencing       professional standards.
These constitute a Handbook and guidelines       `Non-formal education through Outdoor Education in Europe', achieved       through direct work with 50 people and the collaborative contribution of       over 250 people (Source 1).
These resources have been distributed       at Practitioner conferences, via the EOE website and since 2012 have also       been downloadable via academia.edu.
(Number of views 1013).
The Handbooks       are aimed at providers and practitioners of outdoor learning for youth       work.
The Handbook is used in all the countries of the partner       practitioners.
As a result of the NFE project, 14 small companies have been established       in the outdoor education sector in the Brasov region of Transylvania.
It       has been estimated that each company has, on average, approximately 400       customers using these outdoor education services, meaning that the overall       customer base exceeds 5500 people.
The social impact of the services       provided by these outdoor education companies is illustrated by the rapid       expansion of children being actively engaged in outdoor activities with       the parents.
In Hungary, the NFE project has led to the establishment of a Training       Centre by the Human Reform Foundation in Chirui Bai, currently providing       training for approximately 25 people each year.
The majority of these       people have established their own businesses in outdoor education or they       use outdoor education in schools where they teach.
Moreover, the       Foundation, using the NFE methodology, is reaching approximately 200       people per year, where volunteers are trained in the maintenance of the       region's natural habitat.
Following on from the NFE project, Professor Humberstone was invited to       supervise the Breaking Barriers project, a European network of       institutions using outdoor adventure education and experiential learning       to support young people with different disabilities and to establish good       practice for exchange between youngsters and social workers in this field.
A Handbook of Good Practice on `Non formal education through outdoor       activities for disabled people' resulting from this project has been       widely distributed and is freely available through the EOE website (Source         2).
The two Handbooks have had 2894 views since 2011.
The academic research has also been disseminated to practitioner groups       via:            Conferences and workshops European youth workers and practitioners in         social work, teachers and providers (annual EOE conferences http://www.eoe-network.eu/conferences/         (from 2000 in Sweden, Germany, Poland, England Wales, Slovenia, Finland,         Iceland (2014)       NFE workshops (2004-2006) UK and Romania Stan, I.
