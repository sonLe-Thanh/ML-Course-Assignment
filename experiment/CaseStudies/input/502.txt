     Impact on Policy Makers     The business decision-making model developed from the IDCOP and CREW       projects has directly informed local and national government policy       frameworks.
Locally, members of SBERG worked closely with Croydon Council's       Sustainability Team and Lewisham Council's Emergency Planning Team to help       them develop their community resilience plans.
The team briefed council       officials and organised scenario-based cross-departmental workshops with       their adaptation-relevant teams on 15/7/10 (Lewisham) and 08/12/10       (Croydon).
These centred on the impacts of climate change on extreme       weather events that might affect their communities, and provided technical       input into development of their flood risk and overheating adaptation       plans.
Local, regional and national policy makers were also involved       [5.1&#8212;5.3].
Regionally, SBERG worked with the Greater London Authority (GLA) to       understand the adaptation challenges London faces.
The community       resilience factors identified by the CREW project helped inform the       Mayor's Climate Change Adaptation Strategy through a series of meetings       with the Mayor's Strategy Manager for Climate Change Adaptation and his       direct involvement with the CREW project.
As part of this process,       Professor Jones was invited to be a member of the GLA team which presented       the lessons learnt from developing the Mayor's Strategy to an       international policy-making forum at the 2011 Resilient Cities Conference,       Bonn.
Approximately 80 people, representing cities from around the world,       attended a workshop where London's approach to adaptation planning was       held as exemplary [5.4-5.6].
At the national level, Jones briefed the Cabinet Office (29/10/2011) and       DEFRA/EA/DCLG (26/05/2010) civil servants on the CREW project findings as       they affect policy thinking [5.7].
Impact on the built environment industry and its clients     The performance-based approach to built asset management and the       adaptation framework developed through the IDCOP, CREW and RBS projects       formed the basis of two TSB Design for Future Climate Change       projects and seven training/awareness-raising workshops/assemblies for       industry.
In TSB project `PN 400258' (2011-2013), SBERG worked with Octavia Housing       (a Registered Social Landlord) and Pellings (a Chartered Surveying       Practice) to apply the adaptation framework to assessing the resilience of       3,989 homes, located in London, to extreme weather events.
The project       used the framework to evaluate the vulnerability, resilience and adaptive       capacity of Octavia's housing stock and identified pluvial flooding (25.6%       of Octavia's stock is at potential risk from flooding) and overheating       (55.7% of Octavia's stock is at potential risk from overheating) as the       highest risk categories, both today and into the future.
This was at odds       with Octavia's expectations and contingency planning which was primarily       designed around recovering from fluvial flooding.
The adaptation framework       was also used to identify and evaluate 29 adaptation solutions, of which       eight (ranging from technical interventions to working with tenants to       raise awareness and prepare personal flood protection plans) have been       adopted.
Octavia have also reviewed their contingency plans and developed       a built asset management strategy that integrates adaptation of their       existing stock to future climate change.
This represents a fundamental       change in approach to adaptation which is normally reactive rather than       pro-active.
SBERGs involvement with Octavia is on-going [5.8].
In TSB project `EM/1520160' (2011-2012), members of SBERG joined the       client's team (the University of Greenwich) to examine the adaptation       needs to climate change of a new 15,267m2 educational building.
SBERG helped develop a range of future performance scenarios against which       adaptation solutions were assessed.
Twenty five adaptation solutions were       developed by the building's design team (Heneghan Peng, Hoare Lea,       Fanshawe and Alan Baxter Associates) of which seven (ranging from       technical changes to the original design, to future changes in service       equipment) were adopted by the client and included in a future       refurbishment strategy.
This again represents a fundamental change in       approach to climate change adaptation where the future performance of the       building is proactively considered at the design stage and future       solutions integrated into long-term built asset management strategies.
The       integration of climate change adaptation into the initial design stage of       a building was presented to an international audience of Facilities       Managers and Built Environment Professionals at the EFMC2013 Conference in       Prague [5.9].
Finally, the SBERG team worked closely with the London Climate Change       Partnership, Climate South East, London Confederation of Small Businesses       and the London Knowledge Transfer Network to ensure that the CREW       project's outputs raised awareness/understanding and stimulated debate of       climate change resilience and adaptation amongst London businesses.
Five       industry-focused workshops (28/09/10 &#8212; LTN/Willis RE; 08/03/2011 &amp;       10/11/11 LCCP/Climate SE; 05/04/2011 &amp; 13/07/10 &#8212; FLASH) attracting       over 250 delegates, and three Assemblies (03/04/2009, 02/07/10 &amp;       25/11/11) attracting over 280 delegates, ensured that the adaptation       framework reached a wide, non-academic audience [5.5, 5.6].
The framework       is also the subject of a book chapter aimed at industry [5.10].
