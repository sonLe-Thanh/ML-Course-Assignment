     City's Compressors Grouphas developed a worldwide reputation.
It has       advised or assisted 68 organisations in 26 countries on compressor and       expander design.1 It is believed that more than half the       world's screw compressors, currently manufactured, contain our patented       "N" profile rotors.
(1) Economic Impacts     (a) Profiling and Design of Screw Compressors     Our 1996 "N" rotor profile patent (GB9610289) has allowed the design of       screw machines that are cheaper and more efficient, with a broader range       of applications, than earlier technologies.
In many cases, the Group       designed, built and tested machines in order to validate their predicted       performance.
In others licensees, after training at City, have used this       profile to design new products in conjunction with technical advice from       academic staff.
It has been licensed to 27 manufacturers, including       world-leading companies.
Three examples of its use since 2008 are listed       below:             Holroyd, the original sponsors of our Compressor Centre, were         able to penetrate the Chinese market in the face of strong competition         from foreign manufacturers.
This led to their acquisition by the CQME         Group, valued at $1 billion, in June 2010.2         Howden Compressors Ltd is the major compressor manufacturer in         the UK (www.howden.com).
The use of         our "N" rotor profile and new design principles allowed the company to         secure the single largest contract in its history (&#163;14M), raise its         turnover, from &#163;15M in 2009 to &#163;39M in 2011 and expand its staff by 40%.
Income to the University resulting from work with Howden has totalled         over &#163;1M to date.3         RotorComp, a major German manufacturer, developed a new family         of air compressors, also based on our "N" rotor profile, and         consequently increased their sales from 19,000 units to 50,000 units per         annum between 2008 and 2010.
(b) Screw Expanders for Power Recovery from Low Grade Heat     A market survey by BP Alternative Energy International on the use of       City's concepts for power recovery found that the potential world market       was in excess of $5 billion per annum.
Two examples on the use of these       concepts in practice are given below:     Industrial partnership with ELECTRATHERM       ELECTRATHERM (www.electratherm.com) is       a US manufacturer of small scale Organic Rankine Cycle Systems (ORC) for       power generation from low grade heat sources.
In 2006 they were granted a       licence to use the City expander technology for power recovery in their       "Green Machine".
The company has since received investment of more than       $30M.
Since 2011, more than 50 "Green Machine" systems which utilise expanders       manufactured by Howden Compressors Ltd in the UK have been installed in       the field.
These recently reached a cumulative 87,000 hours of operation,       thereby generating approximately 300 MWh of electrical energy so far.
The       demand for such machines is rapidly rising.
New spin-out: HELIEX Power Ltd       HELIEX Power Limited (www.heliexpower.com)       is a spin-out company from City University London established in 2009 to       commercialise innovative steam screw expander technology to utilise waste       energy from industrial steam.
BP Alternative Energy International made an initial investment of &#163;2M at       the end of 2010 to get HELIEX started.2 A further &#163;5M has since       been raised from BP and Greencoat Capital, the investment arm of the       Electricity Supply Board of Ireland.
A further &#163;3M investment from these       companies will have been made by the end of November 2013.
Pre-production       machines have been successfully tested and the first commercial machines       have been installed, including one in a steelworks in Italy.
Currently the       company is valued at &#163;15M and employs 23 people.
Heliex has established a       factory at East Kilbride near Glasgow with a capacity of 2,000 steam screw       expander generator sets per year and production is under way.
The company       has also built a test and development centre which incorporates 160 and       600kW dynamometers and a 0.5MW connection to the national grid.
Each       generator set sells for between &#163;110,000 and &#163;240,000 depending on size.
A       European distributor network is being established and the company is       exploring joint ventures in China (market for 1M units) and India.6       Heliex has been named in the 2013 Global Cleantech 100 list.7     (2) Impacts on the environment     According to the International Energy Agency, approximately 15% of global       electrical energy is consumed by motors driving compressors, while       approximately 80% of all industrial compressors are of the twin screw type       and would benefit from the fitting of our more efficient `N' rotor design.8     Such retrofitting would improve the energy efficiency of these widely       used devices by up to 8%, resulting in a reduction in global power       consumption of at least 0.1% and an equivalent reduction in global CO2       emissions.
Based on Enerdata's Global Energy Statistical Yearbook 2013,       this accounts for around 30 Mega Tons (Mt) of CO2 per annum.9     (3) Impacts on practitioners and professional services     To maximise uptake of our analytical software, we have run training       courses for engineers and designers in more than 30 organisations over the       past few years.
For example, our work with Gardner Denver, the world's largest       manufacturer of air screw compressors, has ensured that the firm now       exclusively use our "N" profile rotors and our DISCO&#169; and SCORPATH       software.
Dr Elvedin Mujic, a former PhD student in the Group, is now a       leading researcher in Bitzer, a major German manufacturer of refrigeration       compressors.
City organises a biennial International conference on `Compressors and       their Systems' which is backed by the IMechE.
It is the main meeting point       of leading engineers and managers from more than 100 major world       compressor manufacturers.
This serves as a forum for dissemination of       results achieved at City and has had a big impact on industry since its       inception in 1999 (http://www.city.ac.uk/compressorsconference).10
