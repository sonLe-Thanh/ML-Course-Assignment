     Our research has informed worldwide dietary advice and therefore the       health and development of children.
It has been cited by national and       international organisations in connection with recommendations for dietary       intake of LCPUFAs and policies on infant nutrition which influence the       dietary advice given by governments to the public.
Additionally, infant       formula manufacturers are guided by recommendations from expert bodies       when considering the amount of LCPUFAs to add to formula and cite the       research in advice given to the public about infant feeding.
In 2013, The World Health Organisation (WHO) published a systematic         review of the long-term benefits of breastfeeding [1], citing Forsyth et           al.
(2003) [v].
The WHO plays a leading role in advising         governments and national health organisations on policy concerning         breastfeeding.
In 2012, the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the         Department of Health and Human Services published new guidelines for         cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children [2].

In 2009 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published a summary of         published research on the beneficial effects of fish consumption and         omega-3 fatty acids on neurodevelopmental health [5], citing Willatts         et al.
(1998a, 1998b) [i,ii] and Willatts and Forsyth         (2000) [iii].
In 2009, the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology,         Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) published a statement on breast         feeding [6] citing Forsyth et al.
(2003) [v].
In 2008, the International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and         Lipids published a statement on dietary fats in infant nutrition [7]         which cited the article by Koletzko et al.
(2008).
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) publishes opinions of the       evidence portfolios surrounding claims for the health benefits of foods       which are submitted by the food industry in European member states.
These       opinions form the basis of food law passed by the European Commission, and       are relevant to the health of the population in Europe.
The research by Willatts       and Forsyth contributed to several recent opinions (2009-2012) [8]       published by EFSA concerning the health benefits of LCPUFAs.
Willatts has been actively involved in communicating the findings       of this research to the general public and health care professionals.
He       has given numerous radio, television and press interviews, as well as       presentations to health care professionals at workshops and symposia.
Infant formula manufacturers have highlighted the research in the       information and advice on infant feeding they provide to the general       public and healthcare professionals.
Examples include Mead Johnson       Nutrition [9], Wyeth Nutrition [10], Danone (Aptamil) [11], DSM [12] and       Nutricia [13].
Willatts has been an invited speaker at numerous national and       international meetings on LCPUFAs and children's development which were       sponsored by industry and other organisations to inform health-care       professionals, industry and the public:            Lecture at the Middle East Pediatric Update in Budapest, May 2013, for         invited health-care professionals, sponsored by Danone.
