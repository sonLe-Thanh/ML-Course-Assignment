     From Research to Impact: Two significant factors currently limit       use of hearing aids: cost and       availability.
WHO figures (2013) indicate that worldwide 360 million       people have a disabling       hearing loss, including 30% of those over 65, especially in Asia and       sub-Saharan Africa.
Hearing       loss affects functional communication, language development in children,       academic achievement,       social and emotional communication and employment opportunities, with       knock-on effects on wider       economies.
Despite clear demand, current production of hearing aid       technology meets less than       10% of global need and in developing countries fewer than 1 in 40 people       who need a hearing aid       have one.
The annual cost of hearing impairment in the EU is estimated to       be &#8364;224 billion and,       whilst in the developed world hearing tests and effective hearing aids are       expensive, in much of the       third world they are unobtainable.
To address these challenges the group       used further EPSRC       funding to develop BioAid, a smartphone app that transforms an iPhone or       iPod into a fully       functioning hearing aid.
The BioAid app was developed to provide a freely       available device that       could be used worldwide not only by individuals, but also as a hearing       test application that can be       used by 'micro-entrepreneurs', equipped with a mobile device and some       other basic equipment,       enabling them to cost-effectively assess the hearing of those in remote       regions that currently lack       any provision for hearing impairment.
The BioAid app: BioAid used the computational       models from the Hearing Dummy projects to derive       correctional strategies to restore lost hearing       functions.
These correctional strategies form the       basis of six basic audiogram shapes, divided into a       total of twenty-four profiles (see figure 1).
With a       standard pair of headphones, users are able to test       these settings at their own pace and in their everyday       environments, in order to find which one best suits       their needs.
An extensive explanation of the research       and technology behind BioAid, as well as the app's       features and capabilities, is available on the BioAid       website [see corroborating source 1].

BioAid Dissemination: BioAid was made freely       available via the iTunes online store in December       2012, and its launch was supported by a project       website and Facebook page [1] [2] [3].
In March 2013       the app was showcased in a University press release       and vodcast [4] and featured in online magazines       across the world including: PhysOrg's `Medical       Xpress', `medgadget', `Healthline', `Hearing Life',       `popbuzz.me' (Australia), and `Top News' (United       Arab Emirates).
The vodcast received 4,500 views in       the first two months [5].
As awareness grew, the       story also received global media coverage.
The       project website details how it was featured both in a large number of       mainstream news outlets, as       well as websites covering areas such as healthcare and technology [6].
In       June 2013, Meddis gave       the invited keynote talk to the `International Forum for Hearing       Instrument Developers' in       Oldenburg, Germany (http://hadf.hoertech.de/)       where he introduced BioAid to manufacturers.
This       invitation-only meeting for scientists, engineers, clinicians and managers       involved in developing the       system technology for hearing instruments hosts key individuals from       industry, universities and       other research institutions.
The 2013 programme included contributions       from GN ReSound,       Starkey and Widex &#8212; three world-leading providers of hearing aid       technology.
BioAid Uptake: By making the app freely available to download and       use, the research team       intended that the widespread proliferation of smartphones in society would       ensure a broad       audience of beneficiaries could be reached.
By August 2013, BioAid had       been downloaded by       more than 20,000 users in over 90 countries, with the greatest number of       downloads occurring in       the US, Germany and Japan [7] [8].
By the same date BioAid had also been       recognised, over       various periods, as the iTunes most downloaded medical app in 11       countries, including Germany,       Egypt and Bahrain [9].
A not-for-profit company working in central Africa       has begun collaboration       with the Essex Hearing Lab to develop a cost-effective hearing test       package for use in remote       areas where lack of resources, power and mobile phone reception limit       individual use of the app.
BioAid Feedback: Overwhelmingly positive feedback received on both       the project and iTunes       websites show that BioAid is enabling significant health and social       benefits [10].
Users of varying       ages and personal circumstances report how BioAid can outperform       conventional hearing aids and       describe the positive effects that its use is having, ranging from       improved social interactions to       increased engagement in education.
Users also commend BioAid's       cost-effectiveness, its ease of       use and its impressive range of settings.
These figures of merit are       acknowledged by an indicative       sample of user feedback, below:     "BioAid enabled me to [...] thoroughly enjoy Easter lunch with my family       and hear every       conversation and domestic sound for the first time in 30 or more years,       absolute bliss!"
"[BioAid] is so much more helpful than anything else I have experienced"       "Its a great substitute or even better than the hearing aids sold in       market for thousands of       pounds"     "Since downloading the BioAid app on his iPad and iPod, my son is       actively taking part in class       discussions"     "[BioAid] provides a simple user friendly way of selecting the       frequencies you need amplifying,       other hearing aids just make everything louder which makes them       uncomfortable most of the       time."
"What distinguishes BioAid from the competition is the availability       within the app of multiple       settings to meet the needs of different types of hearing loss."
Finally, in many cases BioAid is having an important impact even for       those who chose not to use it       as a long-term solution to hearing impairment.
Online discussion, both       between users and with the       developers, illustrates how BioAid has contributed to enhanced dialogue on       this subject [11] [12].
Even if short-term use of BioAid acts as a means of encouraging users to       visit a clinician for a full       consultation, this can still be considered an important aspect of this       impact.
