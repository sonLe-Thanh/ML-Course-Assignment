     In addition to raising public awareness of bibliotherapy and of The       Reader Organisation [TRO], Morrison's Guardian essay has been       widely recognised as the inspiration for hundreds of bibliotherapy groups       that have since been set up under TRO's aegis across the UK and       internationally, as well as for other `reading for therapy' schemes in       Australia and Europe.
TRO, which refers to it simply as `The Article',       credits it with a huge surge in interest and activity over the past five       years, and with transforming the organisation from a hub with just 12       staff for 50 reading groups on Merseyside to an international       bibliotherapy charity with 60 staff members.
[1] Thus:            over 300 people contacted TRO in the week following the essay's         publication       of the 22 press and media reports listed on TRO's website, all but one         short piece appeared after the essay.
it is cited by hundreds of on-line articles and blogs about         bibliotherapy.
[2]        in the two years following its publication, the number of TRO reading         groups grew from 50 concentrated in the Merseyside area to 280         nationally.
This growth led TRO to develop its `Read to Lead' courses which,       in the 3 years between 2008 and 2011, trained 600 people to lead reading       groups in the UK, Denmark, Australia, the US and Germany.
The Director of       TRO has provided a letter verifying this, and will provide further       corroboration on request.
[3]     Impact within the UK     TRO currently has c. 300 people registered as operating its Get Into         Reading [GIR] groups, with most running more than one group each.
Groups average around eight participants at any one time, so at a       conservative estimate several thousand people have engaged with       bibliotherapy in this country alone.
Amongst numerous individual       initiatives which have reported being stimulated by Morrison's article:            In Sandwell (West Midlands) two librarians undertook TRO training,         with funding from Sandwell Primary Care Trust as part of the Community         Libraries Programme, and established GIR groups in 2009/10.
They         describe their experience, and how it was triggered by reading         Morrison's essay, in Panlibus (a library-focused quarterly magazine).
[4]         Both groups continue to meet, and their contribution to a broader scheme         which sought to address mental health issues in the local community is         described in an Arts Council Museums, Libraries and Archives Council         report'.
[5]        NHS East Lancashire funded the establishment of a TRO reading group         scheme in Burnley,[6] initiated and run by the library         service's Reading Development Officer who had been prompted by reading         Morrison's essay to undertake an MA Reading in Practice at Liverpool         University.
Recently, TRO has gained the support of the Sainsbury charitable       foundation, The Headley Trust, which provides funding for projects       relating &#8212; among other things &#8212; to the health and welfare of vulnerable       groups such as those with mental health problems or dementia.
This funding       contributed to a pilot study associated with the Department of Health       National Dementia Strategy, and entailed offering bibliotherapy groups to       people with dementia living in BUPA care homes.
162 reading group sessions       were run, attended by a total of 138 people, and yielding nearly 1300       `beneficiary experiences'.
The outcomes were highly positive; for example       81% or participants showed improvements in mood during the sessions, the       care home managers felt that it had been beneficial in various ways, and       all 22 of the staff trained to run the groups said they would recommend it       to colleagues.
[7] TRO has recently received major funding from       Guys and St Thomas's hospitals to set up 150 new reading groups in South       London over the next three years.
As noted in the previous section,       Goldsmiths is now participating in a collaborative research project to       evaluate the effects of these groups on mental health outcomes.
International impact     Examples of the interest and activity stimulated by Morrison's essay       outside the UK include:             Australia: The republication of Morrison's essay in the         Australian newspaper, The Age, led a librarian in Melbourne to         take a TRO course.
She was awarded a scholarship by the Library Board of         Victoria to study reading groups in the UK, and then to implement and         evaluate a similar group in a Melbourne care home, looking at its         effects on healing, health and wellbeing.
Her encouraging findings are         described in a detailed report[8a] and in 2009 were published         in a widely-read professional journal for Australian librarians.
[8b]         Anecdotal comments on the responses of her participant included: 'It           [the reading group] is the only reason I got out of bed this morning';         and 'There are a lot of activities offered here, but the reading           group is the only thing I come to.
I really look forward to it'.
Another librarian went on to set up a Book Well programme for         the Victoria State Library.
Her report, citing Morrison extensively as         the inspiration for her work, describes a project to train group         facilitators on TRO's GIR model and then to implement and evaluate five         pilot schemes.
[8c] She notes that "everyone involved in           the facilitator training has been especially transformed in some way,           shape, or form &#8212; further testament to the power of a Get Into Reading           group".
Denmark: A researcher (Mette Steenberg) at of Aarhus         University set up The Danish Reading Association (L&#230;seforeningen)         which now runs a number of Get Into Reading schemes in various Danish         cities, following the TRO model.
[9]         Morrison continues to support TRO's work in promoting bibliotherapy.
[10]         In 2010 he spoke at its Get into Reading event in Lancashire and         at its National Conference in Liverpool.
He has spoken about         bibliotherapy at several literature festivals in the UK, including Hay         and Bath.
In January 2012, he chaired a British Council seminar in         Berlin focusing on the relationship between reading, health and         well-being.
As noted previously he will also be a consultant on the         collaborative project, with health service funding, to set up and         evaluate reading groups in London over the next 2-3 years.
