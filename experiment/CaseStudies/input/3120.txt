     A significant proportion of cereal production and other carbohydrate       sources are used as animal and pet feed materials.
The petfood market in       the UK for cats and dogs alone is &#163;2.4BN, and the European market is worth       &#8364;13.5BN per annum.
The animal feed industry utilises 50% of UK cereal       production and is a major consumer of imported maize each year.
A       scientific framework that allows materials and process conditions to be       matched for optimal manufacture is a useful contribution to minimising       wastage and improving product quality.
UoN research has had a major influence on animal feed producers, many of       which have initiated further research projects with Professor Hill to       elicit a better understanding of their processes and how these can be       modified to achieve optimum levels.
The work was disseminated to the       industries, where it is most relevant, through a series of conferences and       invited talks to companies about this subject (Source 5).
The       degree of penetration of the topic has been such that the concept of       starch conversion, coined by UoN researchers [1], is now used       within the industry to illustrate the complex series of changes that occur       to starch as it is broken down.
Modelling the changes to the starches as       they were hydrated, heated and sheared has provided companies with new       options for their processing lines.
This allows for optimisation of the       current processes or the use of different technologies so that the       required product quality, in terms of energy yield and palatability, can       be achieved.
The impact of our research is significant in three major       areas.
These are:     A) Implementation of revised processing strategies for feeds     B) Upgrading of analytical techniques to establish nutrient       benefits of animal feeds     C) Extension of possible resources for animal feeds through novel       processing     An example of A) that shows that a company altering their       processing regime to optimise nutritive performance comes from a quote       from the Head of Monogastric Development at BOCMPauls, a major UK animal       feed manufacturer.
"Data generated showed that with correct thermo         mechanical processing, the rate of starch degradation in-vitro, as         measured by glucose release, is significantly improved.
This information         has been incorporated in to our piglet starter diet formulations as part         of our new product development programme.
The new diets have         demonstrated enhanced performance whilst controlling nutritional scours         which can develop as a consequence of undigested starch passing into the         hind gut."
(Source 1).
Further quotes from the company also       indicate that they are utilising the battery of analytical methods       developed by UoN (B).
These are now robust enough and the       understanding of the relationship between nutrition and processing       sufficiently well-established and measurable, to enable environmental       issues to be dealt with in the holistic mix.
"The extrusion process is         an energy hungry process, however the input of adequate specific         mechanical energy is critical in getting the benefits of the thermo         mechanical processing.
The data generated (from research       programme e and f) has helped with developing methodologies for         quantifying the relationship between energy in and benefits out for the         extrusion process.
By doing this we are now able to optimise production         conditions and therefore minimise units of electrical energy consumed         per tonne of product."
This company has put a monetary value for       this understanding in terms of energy saving "Under "normal use" the         extruder would be consuming around &#163;10 worth of electricity per tonne of         throughput.
We saw that with careful optimisation we could save in the         order of 5% of this cost with no negative effect on physical quality or         starch gelatinisation."
(Source 1).
An example of utilisation of understanding of processing and how this can       be manipulated to use materials not previously commercially viable as       feeds (C) is being exploited by the livestock feed company Dodson       and Horrell.
They are using understanding of processing generated       by UoN to study a material considered as a co-product from the brewing       industry (brewers' grain) as an animal feed stock.
In a statement on the       UoN work on brewers grains, the Director and Consultant Nutritionist of       Dodson and Horrell commented that the work was "promising in terms of         reducing final product cost, utilisation of a feed ingredient that         previously had only been considered as a ruminant feed as a replacement         for a proportion of cereal content and as a protein source."
(Source         2).
UoN facilities, expertise and willingness to work with industrial       partners have also allowed a route for serendipitous exploitation of       ideas.
An example of one such case is the use of the pilot scale equipment       within the School of Biosciences and Professor Hill's research expertise       on extruded starches, to investigate the possibility of extruding silage       to create a novel feed for horses, which is now being manufactured by       Dodson and Horrell on a commercial scale.
"Studies in the Food science         department, utilising their extruder and understanding of extrusion         technologies has enabled Dodson &amp; Horrell to develop a unique         extruded whole-crop maize product for horses.
This product satisfies a         number of criteria, in that the yield per hectare is high relative to         other feed materials, it is produced local to the D&amp;H mill         (environmental criteria), as a high energy feed for horses replaces a         human food material (oats, human food criteria) and does not occupy farm         ground that would be used for human food as the maize forms an ideal         break-crop within the farm cereal production cycle.
Dodson &amp;         Horrell has launched this feed ingredient in its performance and         competition feeds and has maintained horses feed sales in an otherwise         falling market place" (Source 2).
Those working within the animal feed industry need robust predictors of       animal performance and the use of the battery of tests UoN developed       through the LINK programmes have helped establish a range of in vitro       tests that indicate in vivo performance.
This has led to       publications by ABVista (an international supplier of animal feed       ingredients) and their sponsoring of the implementation of these ideas.
The work has led to a new classification of maize samples so that the       company can differentiate itself from other companies by targeting its       animal feed enzymes to the maize variants.
The company uses an online corn       quality assessment (Source 3) as part of their sales tools and part       of the validation of this has been carried out with the University of       Nottingham.
A quote from a research manager at ABVista states (Source 4),       "Optimising the methodology has allowed us to improve our experimental         efficiency and reduce costs.
For example in this last budget year we         have saved significant amounts of money by not commissioning         digestibility studies which we now know are inappropriate.
For example,         an animal trial may carry a cost of &#163;25,000".
"Such information         is essential for us to maintain our position in a highly competitive         environment and to enable us to move forward and expand our sales in all         markets.
It is impossible to put an exact value on such research, but it         would be impossible for us to stay competitive without it."
The combined knowledge of material changes during processing and animal       nutritional quality makes UoN an obvious first port of call for companies       looking to establish improved and novel processing for animal feeds.
For       example Professor Hill took part in and organised a number of workshops       (five between 2008 and 2011) that helped shape the strategy and basis for       the Mars Petcare business (Source 5).
A further example of the       impact of the understanding of nutrition and processing understanding is       demonstrated by GA Petfoods.
This company are developing a novel process       and between 2010 and 2013 they invested &#163;18 million for the innovative       manufacture of dry pet foods.
To aid in the success of this venture a       knowledge partnership was established with Professors Wiseman and Hill as,       "the group in Biosciences at Nottingham University are leaders in this         field and have a proven record of industrial co-operation."
"Their         knowledge will help assure that the investment is beneficial and will         allow greater penetration of the UK and European pet food market" (Source         6).
