     The research has achieved impact at various levels:            At national level, findings from the HOME Study         (Publication 3) were presented alongside the other three studies that         were funded under the ESRC's Multiple Exclusion Homelessness Research         Programme at a launch event organised by Shelter in London in September         2011, which was attended by about 90 policy-makers and practitioners         from the field of homelessness and supported housing.
Our evidence was         an integral part of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation's research round-up         document (McDonagh, 2011), which was given to all delegates and         placed on the JRF web site.
A high level representative from the         Department for Communities and Local Government stated that this         `powerful evidence' would be fed into the cross departmental Ministerial         Working Group on Homelessness.
Findings were also endorsed by Grant         Shapps, Minister for Housing and Local Government, in an accompanying         press release (Homeless Link, 2011), and a delegate from the Department         for Work and Pensions commended their value in highlighting the support         needed in securing labour market access for adults with complex needs         (Department for Work and Pensions, Labour Market Inclusion Division         e-mail).
Since then, the Ministerial Working Group has acknowledged the         influence of the Multiple Exclusion Homelessness Programme on its most         recent proposals on homelessness (Department for Communities and Local         Government, 2012, pp.8-10, 13) which share the importance that our         research demonstrated of the role played by homeless people's encounters         with support services in either preventing or causing homelessness.
Likewise, our findings that multiple disadvantages compound one another         in reinforcing homelessness and other problems has been recognised by         the Government's Social Justice Cabinet Committee in urging a         multi-agency approach to acute deprivation (Department for Work and         Pensions, 2012, p.49).
At local level, impact has been achieved through the         long-standing relationship between Bowpitt and Framework Housing         Association mainly through the sponsorship of postgraduate students         noted above.
Framework Housing Association has testified to the value of         its research, including that undertaken in collaboration with Nottingham         Trent University (Research reference one; Walsh, 2006).
Exploratory         research informs the way they work and evaluative research tests the         quality of services and measures its benefit to service users, all as a         basis for developing and sharing good practice.
Wider local reach has been achieved through the HOME Study,         during which two practitioner workshops in London and Nottingham in         December/January, 2010/11 were attended by managers and practitioners         from public and voluntary sector services used by homeless people, at         which early findings from the ESRC funded study were presented and         debated.
Subsequent to these events, delegates have indicated ways in         which findings have been used by their respective organisations in, for         instance, informing service specification for commissioners (Notts         Supporting People Team, Commissioning Officer e-mail) or supporting bids         for funding (Big Life Group, Executive Director e-mail).
In Nottingham,         the Emmanuel House day centre commissioned a report based on an analysis         of our findings concerning the value of day centres to people with         multiply excluded forms of homelessness, and this report was used to         help avert the threat of closure by securing new funding from private         sources at a time when local authority funding was withdrawn (Emmanuel         House, Operations Manager e-mail).
Further reach has been achieved among the population of single         homeless people who have been the subject of our research, and this too         has generated some impact.
A total of 10 peer researchers in Nottingham         and London participated in the HOME study in designing research tools,         undertaking semi-structured interviews, providing feedback on early         analysis, and disseminating findings.
A DVD has been produced in         collaboration with our team of peer researchers to summarise the         findings in a format accessible to homeless people and service         practitioners.
The HOME Study DVD is available for viewing on You Tube.
This experience of involvement in the delivery of a research project has         enhanced their employability and contributed to securing employment in         several cases.
