     (a) Reach     Woods' research has achieved impact in the fields of civil society,         cultural life, and public discourse through a wide range of outputs       in 4 main areas: publications, public engagement, education, and the       Gender Studies list of the European Reference Index for the Humanities       project.
Publications:     Sales figures (09/13): History of Gay Literature 5,672; Historia         de la literatura gay 1,028.
Typically, sales of poetry are much       lower (e.g.
Quidnunc c200, An Ordinary Dog c250), yet       impact may prove no less profound and lasting.
Public engagement:     Woods is an exceptional example of writer, academic and community       activist who has brought his work directly to community groups and         public services to address and challenge homophobia, promote mental       health and aspiration among marginalized young people and promote HIV/AIDS       awareness and HIV prevention (e.g.
his famous safer-sex poem `My Lover       Loves' in May I Say Nothing).
His readings and talks at health       service and community group events emphasize key messages about the       desirability of challenging prejudice and directly address the health and       social needs of his target audience.
He has concentrated on regional         events for library services, the NHS, local authorities, lesbian,       gay, bisexual, and transgender groups, etc.
In this REF period he gave 3 film         introductions (Broadway, Nottingham), one including a post-screening       discussion with the director and producer; poetry readings in       bookshops (Waterstone's, Nottingham; Gay's the Word, London) and at       festivals (Lowdham x2, Dulwich, Beeston, Queer Up North Manchester,       Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Trans History Month x2 in London, and       Ljubljana Gay and Lesbian Film Festival), and the opening public event at       Nottingham Contemporary.
He participated in discussions on gay         literature at Leicester's States of Independence independent presses       day (x3) and at Nottingham/shire Libraries Readers Day (x2 including an       in-conversation with novelist Armistead Maupin) and spoke on gay erotic       literature at Parlare, Royal Festival Hall, London.
He gave art         gallery talks at Nottingham Contemporary, Djanogly Gallery, and       Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, UCL.
He gave networking         addresses at Ashfield District Council and Nottingham/shire       Healthcare Trust Employee Partnership Conference, and was guest of honour       and keynote speaker at the annual Rainbow         Heritage Awards evening (02/13), Nottingham Council House.
Dr James       Moran said of Woods (BBC Radio Nottingham 6/08/13): `He is a really       important local figure ... Lots of people will have seen him talking about       his poetry in local libraries, art galleries, theatres and all sorts of       places around Nottingham ...
He's really adept at swapping between the       seminar room and then going out and talking to real people and getting       them excited about literature'.
Woods has further developed his public engagement through online         social media: his website       has had 32,000 visits; his new blog       1600+ visits; and he has 1400+ followers on Twitter.
Education beyond the UoA:     Woods' critical work is foundational in gay studies worldwide.
It is used       on courses too numerous and varied to list here, but examples include:       "Queering Fictions in the 20th Century" (ENLI10326), U of Edinburgh; MA in       Modern Literature, U of Leicester; "African-American Literature" (EN3303),       Royal Holloway, London; "Literary Representation and the History of       Homosexuality" (ENGL3021), UCL; English PhD course, Solapur U, India; and       others at California State U, Birkbeck, Bergamo, Venezia Ca' Foscari.
It       was used as an organisational model for The Gay Mormon Literature         Project (2009-) by Gerald Argetsinger, Rochester Institute of       Technology.
Woods' poetry was used on courses at (e.g.)
Durham, Istanbul,       and U of the Arts London.
(See 5.1.)
More broadly, in mainstream literary       studies, A History of Gay Literature is the standard text,       referenced in such textbooks as Pope, The English Studies Book       (Routledge 2002), Bertens, Literary Theory: The Basics (Routledge       2008), Barry, Beginning Theory (MUP 2009).
Woods has facilitated gay academic research in many further ways.
A major       example from this REF period is his chairing (2004-13) of the Gender       Studies expert panel for the European Reference Index for the         Humanities.
The European Reference Index for the Humanities       lists have been widely used by research agencies at national and       university levels for evaluating research proposals and outputs.
The       project has now been taken over by the Norwegian Research Council.
(b) Significance     Since there is no established consensus on how to measure the impact of       literary criticism or poetry beyond quantification of outputs (as above),       NTU commissioned an independent survey, recruited via social media, to       provide a snapshot of the significance of Woods' research.
(See 5.1.)
Unprecedented in the Humanities, this approach provides direct         empirical evidence of impact which might otherwise be merely       speculative.
Given that self-completion surveys represent a small sample,       usually in the order of 2%, of the eligible population, this survey       suggests, through participation alone, evidence of the impact of Woods'       work on many thousands of people worldwide.
By several measures       (countries, professions, etc.)
this sample shows far-reaching       international impact.
123 people responded from a range of categories,       including teachers in HE and schools, arts administrators, writers,       critics, booksellers, as well as lay readers, from countries including       Brazil, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Latvia, Singapore, S.Africa, Spain       and USA.
The survey also provides both quantitative and qualitative       evidence of depth of impact.
Over 90% said Woods' work had substantially       affected their understanding of gay literature and their sense of its       breadth, and over 80% had changed their view of what openly gay poetry can       achieve.
Nearly 80% said he had changed their view of homophobia in       culture.
Respondents attested to a profound and lasting impact that extends         across educational, creative, social, and cultural contexts: `I've       come back to the [History] again and again over the years, and it       continues to offer insight and guidance'.
His work `opened paths for       critical thinking' and had `a liberating intellectual effect'.
`He broke       down doors so that a new generation ... could walk through those doors       easily'.
`He has made me realise the huge complexity and richness of gay       literature and its centrality within Western culture'.
His critical/creative work has had a profound effect on writers: `He       helps me feel less alone in my work'; `His early studies ... more or less       gave me the theme of my first collection'.
He `influenced my thinking and       my practice as a writer'.
He `inspired my own work'.
Broader impact was felt by readers in general, empowering their sense of       gay identity: he `helped me in forming my own identity as a gay man'.
`As       a gay man, I have found my own life and experience elucidated'.
His poetry       `changed my life'.
`His work has been, for me, a way of life and a mode of       being'.
`He is the most important poet writing on gay themes outside the       USA.
He ... corrected many of the stereotypes of gay men in popular       culture'.
The poetry was said to be `exemplary ... putting queer theory       into practice,' `an eye-opener ... as to what poetry can be used for       politically,' and `a revelation, giving voice to things so often still not       voiced'.
