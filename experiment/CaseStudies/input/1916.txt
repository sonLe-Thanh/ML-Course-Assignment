     With partners in the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, the city's economic       development       company, Liverpool Vision, and environmental NGO Groundwork Merseyside,       Liverpool University       researchers North, Nurse and Barker established the ESRC-funded Low Carbon       Liverpool       Knowledge Exchange Partnership as a "focussed attempt to shift the         framework of public policy         and shape the terms of public debate within Liverpool around the         challenges of climate change and         the need for cities to embrace a low carbon approach to sustainability"(1).
The Partners worked       together to develop common understandings of the issues through       secondments of university       researchers to the partners, through participant observation of the policy       making process, and       through action research.
Results were published in a report (North and       Barker, 2011 available at       www.lowcarbonliverpool.com) and       presented to an audience of some seventy local policy makers       in February 2011.
The report's recommendations were welcomed by our local       partners (1, 3.
4) who       felt it and associated consultations provided a "strong evidence base"(1)       which "helped catalyse a         coalition that is determined to ensure that Liverpool creates the         conditions that enable the city to         reap the rewards from such an approach'"(1,6).
The report       provided options for stakeholders to       explore and action, benchmarking the current status of activity and       setting quantifiable       measurements from which future progress can be charted.
This independent       external assessment       was welcomed by Liverpool City Council in informing local policy on       environmental change and       climate issues (1,5,7) Research findings framed a new       understanding on the need for Liverpool to       develop on a more sustainable approach, which were written into local       strategic documents       including Merseyside's Local Transport Plan(2):     "The project helped to provide a platform for taking forward key         themes around reducing         carbon emissions from transport whilst supporting sustainable economic         growth, where         walking, cycling and public transport are the modes of transport of         choice, and where long         distance trips by motorised transport are minimised."
The Primary Care Trust provided funding for a Strategic Policy Officer       based at the Chamber of       Commerce.
This integration had significant impact on cementing the       partnership of the key project       stakeholders, and on policy formation and strategic planning to improve       the city's environmental       performance (6).
After the launch a wider range of partners emerged who established a new       multi-agency Green       Partnership which was formally launched in July 2013 and which "gave         the project an immediacy         and potency it would otherwise have lacked.
(1) This wider       group continued to use processes of co-production       to research the advantages of the European Green Capital bid process to       catalyse low       carbon policy making at the urban scale.
The bid process "became a         motor for focussed action         and engaged a whole range of institutions and public and private bodies         with the project".
Our       research included an analysis of the experiences of previous Green       Capitals and other examples       of good urban practice.
It included an audit of Liverpool's environmental       performance, which was       presented in March 2013 and identified four areas of poor performance       (recycling levels, cycle       lanes, use of green cars, and water metering) which were widely discussed       in the city.
(5, 6) The       partnerships work and the associated debate influenced the establishment       of a Mayoral       Commission to accelerate progress and performance in this area (5,6).
Thus impact can be demonstrated through:     (1) Catalysing local discussion, public understanding and debate reported       in the local media,       including eight events involving between 50 and 100 delegates from the       public, private and       community sectors which discussed and analysed the issues (1,5)       in a city where climate change       had not been a priority and in a sceptical political environment with the       result that:     "socially innovative approaches to the creation of sustainable         economies and communities         have not been side-lined but have retained strength and potential as a         pathway to growth         and economic opportunity.
"(1)     (2) Improved partnership working and stimulating policy debate.
The       report's key recommendation,       that Liverpool look to "improve the alignment of programmes, processes         and awareness"(1, 5) was       accepted.
The co-production process has been owned by partners in what       they saw as an       "interesting and innovative journey"(,3,4, 5).
The       impact of Low Carbon Liverpool has not just been       excellent university research accepted by and then adopted by partners:       they have welcomed the       ability to explore new ideas that at first felt uncomfortable, which       challenged conventional wisdom.
Low Carbon Liverpool has provided a "trusted, neutral space for the         improved alignment of         programmes, processes and awareness" (5) with the       university fulfilling the role of facilitator and       trusted arbiter, Partnership working     "has helped break down silos and bureaucratic boundaries which         hindered a holistic         approach.
There is now greater possibility of `joined-up' thinking and         compatible and         coherent action with more intellectual `osmosis' between institutions,         especially through the         engagement of the public sector with the private and academic knowledge         base within the         city.
"(1);     (3) The adoption of the project's proposals, including the methodology       for working up a bid to be a       European Green Capital (b) the audit of the city's environmental       performance and (c) the creation       and launch of the Liverpool Green Partnership to take these issues forward       in concrete ways(6).
