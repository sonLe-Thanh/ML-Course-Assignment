     Throughout his academic career, Hopper has been committed to       communicating his work beyond an academic audience, and has maintained a       particular interest in adult education and distance learning.
From 1999 to       the present he has worked as a tutor for Oxford University's Department       for Continuing Education (OUDCE).
He has taught twenty-four 10-week       courses for their Weekly Public Programme Office, specialising in modern       and contemporary Irish literature and film, and literary adaptation (his       courses since 2008 include `Flann O'Brien: An Introduction to his       Writings' and `Irish Writing After Joyce').
Since 2008, he has taught six       week-long summer school programmes for international students on Irish       literature and film.
He has also written and taught a series of online       programmes for OUDCE, including, most recently, `Modern Irish Literature'       (2008).
Hopper has directed and lectured on three Public Day Schools,       including `Modernism and the City' (9 February 2013), `"Make It New":       Modernist Literature' (11 February 2012), `James Joyce: New Perspectives'       (12 February 2011).
Hopper's research on modern and contemporary Irish literature and film       has been disseminated through books, newspapers, magazines, radio, and TV.
Prior to 2008, he contributed to two TV documentaries for RT&#201; (on Flann       O'Brien) and Channel 4 (on Irish cinema).
More recently, he contributed to       two radio documentaries on Flann O'Brien for Bookbound (Dublin       City FM, 2009), and Arts Tonight (RT&#201; Radio 1, 2011): http://www.rte.ie/radio1/arts-tonight/programmes/2013/0909/473230-arts-tonight-monday-9-september-2013/?clipid=1307036       [listening figures: 15,000].
Hopper has written essays and reviews on Flann O'Brien for the New         Statesman (`With Love and Squalor' [`Critic at Large'], 15 August       2011) and the Irish Times (`The Balm and the Bane of the       Intelligentsia', 26 March 2011), and is a regular contributor to the Times         Literary Supplement.
His influence in shaping the public       appreciation of contemporary Irish literature and film is evidenced in his       most recent articles for the TLS:            `No Apologies' [review of three books by Desmond Hogan] (26 July         2013), 20.       Review of The Scattering by Jaki McCarrick (7 June 2013), 21.       Review of Shall We Gather at the River by Peter Murphy (15         February 2013), 22.
`Irish Slides' [review essay of two books on Irish cinema] (16         November 2012), 31.
The main findings of Hopper's research have been communicated to       audiences at cultural events, talks, and discussions at community,       national and international locations.
To mark the centenary of Flann       O'Brien's birth in 2011, he was the keynote speaker at international       conferences held in Singapore and Vienna.
Several other centenary events       were open to the public, including talks for the Woodstock Literary       Society, Oxfordshire (December 2011), the Irish Cultural Centre,       Hammersmith, London (October 2011), Trinity College, Dublin (October       2011), Birkbeck College, London (May 2011), and Sligo Institute of       Technology (February 2010).
Hopper is also a member of the International       Flann O'Brien Society (Steering Committee, 2011-present).
This impact feeds into a developing network of links with cultural and       community organisations in Britain and Ireland, and further afield in       Europe and Southeast Asia.
In June 2013, to mark the publication of The         Short Fiction of Flann O'Brien, the book was launched at the Irish       Embassy in Rome during the Second International Flann O'Brien Conference       (this event was covered by the Irish Times: http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/the-hard-life-meets-la-dolce-vita-1.1438055).
Other recent public events include an interview with actors/directors Mark       O'Halloran and Mikel Murfi at Universit&#224; Roma Tre (June 2013), and a       public lecture on Flann O'Brien at St Mary's University College (April       2013).
In February 2013, Hopper chaired a panel on Irish literature for Irish         Writing London at the Irish Cultural Centre, Hammersmith, which led       to him being invited to join the Advisory Board of the Irish Writers'       Festival, London.
As part of the 2013 Irish Writers Festival, Hopper was invited to give a       public lecture on Flann O'Brien at House of Commons, London (8 October       2013).
(Although strictly speaking this event falls beyond the census       cut-off date (31 July), the impact being claimed is evidence of Hopper's       research influence on the group of MPs who sponsored the event, i.e.
the       All Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain, a body of       considerable significance in this context.
