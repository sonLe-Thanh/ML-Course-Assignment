     As a direct result of Thompson's research on Bloch, Marxism and the       Frankfurt School, he has become a regular media commentator on religious       affairs from an atheist perspective.
This started in 2007 with a `Face to       faith' column in The Guardian and then led to Thompson being       commissioned to write an ongoing series of columns in that paper from       2009, with some 34 columns by July 2013 [S1].
These include two specialist       8-column series, the first on `Karl Marx' (2011), and the second on `The       Frankfurt School' (2013).
Following his initial Guardian       contributions, Thompson was also invited to write a long article (3,000       words) for the Church Times which was published on Christmas Day       2010.
These national press contributions have significantly heightened       public engagement with atheism [S5], as is evidenced by the c.10,000       comments on Thompson's columns.
To date, Thompson's Guardian       columns [S1] have been read by at least 75,000 individual users; given the       extent of the readership, it is difficult to define the exact type of       beneficiary of Thompson's work on atheism, but they include international       audiences [S6], with a particularly active US and Spanish cohort of       readers contributing to the comments section.
The international reach is       also evidenced by the translation of Thompson's Marx series into Turkish       [S2], and the republication of the columns on a Basque blogsite [S3], for       example.
Thompson's work has reached all age ranges from students to       retired school-teachers, many of whom have sent personal emails to       Thompson, who responds both to private emails and to reader comments on       the Guardian online forums, thereby actively engaging in public       debate.
The major impact thus generated from Thompson's research has been on       public debate about the nature of the relationship between atheism and       religion from a Blochian standpoint which goes beyond the sterility of       "New Atheism" and takes full cogniscence of the importance of religious       belief as a part of the human condition rather than seeing it as a       delusion.
This means that for an atheist like Bloch, taking religion       seriously can more easily change public opinion on the topic of atheism.
This is done via a range of modes of public and media engagement, both in       print and online journalism and through podcasts/publications of public       talks and national radio broadcasts.
From public talks to online journalism     For example in August 2009, Thompson was invited to contribute to a       non-academic public art conference in Amsterdam, to discuss the role of       Bloch's concept of a "concrete utopia" in artistic and cultural urbanism.
The audience of 250 for this event was made up largely of city planners       and cultural workers and Thompson's talk has been published subsequently       in Jeanne van Heeswijk's artbook The Blue House (2013) [S4].
Similarly, in November 2009, and issuing from the Verso introduction [R2],       Thompson was invited to give a paper on Bloch, Brecht and Benjamin at the       public launch of the book Walter Benjamin and Bertolt Brecht: Story of         a Friendship by Erdmut Wizisla, the director of the Brecht and       Benjamin archives in Berlin, at Birkbeck University of London       (subsequently podcast online via Backdoor Broadcasting).
The informal       public response to this subsequently led Thompson to publish again on       Benjamin, this time in relation to Bloch, in his 2013 Guardian       column on the Frankfurt School.
A reader comment from 29 April 2013 states       that: "I have learned a lot from this series [...].
The most important         thing for me has been reading Benjamin and Bloch.
[...].
Bloch opened up         a really new line of approach to Marxist analysis", demonstrating       how Thompson's research and impact activities have informed the public       about a key avenue of philosophical thought which influences their       outlook.
From online journalism to national radio broadcast     Similarly, on the basis of Thompson's work on atheism, Marx, faith and       authority in The Guardian, the BBC commissioned a 45-min Sunday       feature for Radio 3 on the first German atheist playwright, Georg B&#252;chner,       which was broadcast in February and August 2011.
Thompson wrote and       presented the documentary, for which the listening figure was 100,000 on       each occasion, demonstrating how Thompson's research has fed into a wider       public debate about the cultural outputs which emerged from this       philosophical school of thought [S7].
The invitation by the BBC to write       the B&#252;chner documentary happened alongside the invitation from The         Guardian to write the Marx column series in 2011; a similar link-up       with the BBC for a radio series based on the Frankfurt School columns is       also underway.
Specifically, it is as a result of Thompson's interventions that Bloch is       once again being recognised by scholars, independent philosophers and       members of the public alike, as a thinker who has much to contribute to       the debate on atheism and religion in the modern world [S8].
For example,       an anonymous comment from a member of the public on Thompson's Guardian       column stated the following: "I wonder if the attraction of this         extraordinary philosophy [of the Frankfurt School] has anything to do         with the collapse of religious faith.
[...] I have long wanted to study         the theories and motivations of the Frankfurt school.
[...] This has         been a good introduction."

Besides his work derived specifically from Blochian thought, Thompson has       also written more broadly on commemorations of the war for The         Guardian (e.g.
for Remembrance Sunday 2012) and in November 2012 he       also took part as a speaker in a Sheffield Salon event on the Second World       War attended by over 70 members of the public.
As is evidenced, Thompson's       impact activities thus range from one-off events, to long-term       collaborations (e.g.
with The Guardian), and have become an       integral part of Thompson's research cycle since at least 2007.
