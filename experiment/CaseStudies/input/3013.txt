     1.
The key impact of this body of research is the reduction of likelihood         of personal information disclosures from research data.
The immediate         beneficiaries are national and international data stewardship         organisations (DSOs), who have responsibility for disseminating data       whilst at the same time maintaining confidentiality.
The reach of this       impact has increased in recent years from national statistical agencies       (UK and overseas) to include government departments &#8212; such as the       Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and the Department for Communities       and Local Government (DCLG) who are under increasing pressure to release       administrative data as part of a wider `open data' agenda.
Impact has been delivered through collaborative research partnerships         with practitioners and professional services in data stewardship.
This research, consultancy and advisory work in relation to data       management and confidentiality has helped to shape professional best       practice in the field.
The body of work described here is impact-embedded       research.
An example of this is [B], which describes an algorithm       developed whilst analysing the risk inherent in the Neighbourhood       Statistics &#8212; work carried out for ONS several years earlier.
Overall,       impact has been delivered through a variety of pathways:           Impact through DSOs adopting methods into their practice.
The         Canadian firm Privacy Analytics Inc. has utilised [D]: "as part of           the general heuristic for re-identification risk assessment in our           software, [with Elliot's] work on scenarios of attack (1999)           and SAR data (2001, 2007) helping shape the methodology that is being           used by the company.
Privacy Analytics, Inc.'s solutions have been           leveraged by approximately 70 organizations in the US and Canada to           control their disclosure risk, including: the American Society of           Clinical Oncology, Heritage Provider Network, Icahn School of Medicine           at Mount Sinai, Department of Preventative Medicine, State of           Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, Alberta Healthcare,           Cancer Care Ontario, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, College           of Family Physicians of Canada, Public Health Agency of Canada, TELUS           Health, and Vancouver Costal Health" [1].
Likewise, after reading         articles and presentations of the research at meetings, the Australian         Bureau of Statistics noted that: "Your work helped shape ABS's           current thinking on confidentiality protection for microdata...         [and has] assisted the ABS to produce high quality statistics while           maintaining provider trust" [2].
Specifically on [D]: Statistics         Canada say: "The Skinner-Elliot measure, adapted for survey weights           by Skinner &amp; Carter, is often used by our surveys to provide an           indication of the risk inherent in certain combinations of their           variables.
The measure has been incorporated in our in-house           disclosure risk generalized program" [3].
On documents [C] and [E] ONS say: "Previous work carried out by Dr           Elliot continues to have an impact on the way we conduct our           assessment of risk at ONS [and] ONS occasionally use the           Skinner and Elliot (2002) metric to assess microdata releases which           come to us for approval via our Microdata Release Panel and in           particular a significant contribution consistently used is Dr Elliot's           concept of special uniqueness involving the identification of uniques           that stand out regardless of geography.
Many of his research ideas           have been fundamental in informing GSS Disclosure Control Policy for           Social Survey Microdata" [4].
Further afield, the US Census Bureau         contends that the research has "had a significant impact on the way           in which disclosure control is carried out in our organisation",         and that they have adopted the concept of special uniques in their         reidentification studies which: "has helped us to identify public use           microdata records that are at risk of disclosure.
We are then able to           slightly distort those records so that we can release them while           preserving the statistical properties of the data" [5].

Based on the principles developed in [A] and [E], Elliot set up the           Data Environment Analysis Service (DEAS) with funding from ONS, to         guide the specifications of the 2011 Census outputs.
This informed ONS's         own disclosure risk analyses and policy, with their Head of Statistical         Disclosure confirming that it: "greatly assisted ONS in performing           day-to-day disclosure risk assessments of our microdata and knowing           under what conditions they should be released.
It also informed the           specification of the Sample of Anonymised Records (microdata from the           2011 Census)" [4].
3.
The provision of consultancy reports to DSOs, evaluating the           disclosure risks from specific datasets (to be disseminated) or           analysing the risk impact of particular policy decisions.
Commissioned on the basis of the expertise and track record of Dr Elliot         and his team, these evaluations (`Report on the Disclosure Risk         associated with Fire and Rescue Incident Datasets', `Report on the         Disclosure Risk associated with Supporting People Datasets', `Disclosure         Risk Audit of the Smart Steps Data Service') directly apply the research         reported above.
For example, the report to Telefonica         (`Disclosure Risk Audit of the Smart Steps Data Service') highlighted         the potential risks of providing information at multiple units of         geography, and the need to suppress small counts in remote areas to         ensure individuals cannot be identified through reverse engineering [6].
These reports have enabled DSOs to make better decisions about the data         in question, resulting in safe and usable data.
For example, DCLG         confirms that: "[the] work showed that the database which I provided           was far from anonymised in practice" and in turn this:           "...showed that we needed to proceed with access to the database in a           secure setting and/or under data access conditions" [7].
Similarly, ONS note that: "The outcome of [`EUL to OGD: A Risk         Analysis'] will have significant implications on the way ONS will           provide data to its customers in the future, and helps ONS to meet           government strategic aims in proactively supporting the Open Data           Agenda" [4].
4.
The provision of dedicated SUDA software to DSOs to help them         carry out of their own disclosure risk analyses [8].
Several DSOs, such         as the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Singapore Department of         Statistics, have incorporated the software into their data dissemination         practice.
For example, the Australian Bureau of Statistics confirms         that: "Since 2007 SUDA has been a part of the standard assessment           process for all CURFS [Confidentialised Unit Record Files]           released by the ABS.
In particular SUDA is used to help identify risky           records.
Generally, as a result of the SUDA analysis, a number of           records on each CURF are given additional confidentiality treatment to           mitigate the identification risk" [2].
5.
The provision of certificated safe researcher training         delivered via the Administrative Data Liaison Service (ADLS), a service         set up to support research using administrative data (www.adls.ac.uk).
The primary goal of the training is to educate participants in dealing         with data safely, and is attended by DSO staff as well as researchers.
The course is part of the Safe Researcher Training Programme and is         endorsed by major administrative data holding organisations in the UK         and the Information Commissioner's Office.
By the end of 2013 this         course will have run 14 times, each attended by 20-50 participants.
The         research is embedded throughout the course and is the basis of the most         important module of the course.
The course is an approved method for           access to administrative data held by the Scottish government and NHS           Scotland.
6.
The development of the UK Anonymisation Network (UKAN), set           up to establish best practice in anonymisation.
Led by Elliot and         funded by the UK Information Commissioner, UKAN offers practical advice         and information to anyone who handles personal data and needs to share         it (www.ukanon.net).
The network         provides a range of resources to private and public sector data holders         in the UK, including anonymisation clinics (where individual         DSOs attend to receive guidance on specific data anonymisation         problems), and a web site providing case studies of disclosure           control in practice, including several derived from UoM research.
In a joint press release, the UK Information Commissioner, said: "The           work of UKAN will help build on the recommendations laid down in the           ICO's data protection code of practice on managing the risks related           to anonymisation which we published last year" [9].
The information economy requires the free flow of data, but privacy       breaches lead to a breakdown of trust, respondent non-co-operation and DSO       over-cautiousness.
Armed with the tools and methods developed from this       research, DSOs can proceed with greater confidence, and make more informed       data release decisions.
As ONS state: "The long-term impact of the         reports above and ongoing collaborative work with Dr Elliot has meant         that ONS can demonstrate a rigorous and considered approach to data         dissemination given a fuller understanding of the potential disclosure         risk.
This helps ONS to achieve its vision to produce high quality         trusted statistics that meet user needs."
[4] Similarly, the US       Census Bureau agrees that: "The broader impact of this work is to help         ensure that we can disseminate high quality data products whilst         maintaining the confidentiality of respondents" [5].
In sum, without this work delivery of the open data agenda would be       significantly hampered.
