     Impacts on society, culture and creativity:       Public understanding has improved, and public debate has been         stimulated and informed by research       Out of the collaboration between BPV researchers in Biochemistry,       Plant Sciences and Chemical Engineering and researchers of the       `Design in Science' project at the Institute for Manufacturing (IfM)       arose the `Moss Table'.
The designers at IfM, Alex Driver and Carlos       Peralta, were keen to create       an item which the general public could easily relate to, through which       they could showcase BPV       technology.
The table incorporates 112 BPV moss pods where photosynthate       of moss leads to       generation of current, which aids in powering an integrated table lamp.
The Moss Table has       become a high profile tool to educate about opportunities for sustainable       design, as well as the       challenges of generating sufficient renewable energy.
The table and/or the BPV technology has been exhibited at high         profile international design         fairs (London Design Festival 2011; Salone Satellite of Milan         Furniture Fair 2012; ALIVE / En Vie,         Paris, 2013), at national and regional science exhibitions (Royal         Society Summer Science         Exhibition 2010, Big Bang Fair 2011, National Science Week March 2012         and 2013, EPSO         Fascination of Plants Day May 2012 and 2013, National Sciences Week /         Bio Biology Day Oct         2012), and through an event in the `Living Designs' series of the       InCrops Enterprise Hub (Jan         2013).
The exhibit received extensive international press         coverage (including the New York         Times, the Financial Times, and Made Magazine; Refs 1-2, Section 5)       and global attention via       blogs and newsletters.
It has been selected by members of the public as       the "peoples' choice"         for the Design Icons Exhibition organised by Creative Front       Cambridgeshire for the Design       Council in Feb 2012 (Ref.
3, Section 5).
A film about the BPV technology       and the Moss Table has       been part of the British Council-sponsored touring exhibition         `Everything &#8212; Forever &#8212; Now',       showcasing contemporary approaches to sustainable design coming out of       Britain that use new       technologies and materials.
So far the exhibition has visited Thailand,       Malaysia, Vietnam and       Poland (Ref.
4, Section 5).
The Moss Table Project is featured in the book       Bio Design &#8212; The         Convergence of Science, Technology and Creativity, by Myers and       William, published 2012, which       profiles recent works that illustrate the convergence of design and       biology (Ref.
5, Section 5).
In       addition, the Moss Table was included in the technology section of the Channel         4 program         "Sunday Brunch" on 13/5/12, and the BPV technology was featured by       South-African       collaborators of the Cambridge consortium on the "Space Life" radio         show of the Assembly Radio       station (based in Cape Town) on 15/2/13 (Ref.
6, Section 5).
Through the exhibitions, fairs and events an estimated minimum of 50,000       people in 7 countries       (UK, Italy, France, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Poland) have interacted       directly with the BPV       technology (Ref.
7, Section 5)), and millions more have learned about it       through the media       coverage and online resources (based on their traffic figures).
Repeated       requests have been       received to purchase the moss table or other BPV technologies that have       been showcased, which       indicates interest and engagement created through the publicity.
Impacts on commerce:       A spin-out company (H+Energy Ltd; Company No.
05942643) was set up in 2006       by members of       the consortium led by Howe in order to develop commercial exploitation of       the technology, leading       in 2007 to the filing of a patent protecting the BPV technology by the       company (Ref.
8, Section 5).
In 2009 H+Energy became a wholly owned subsidiary of Ortus Energy Ltd       (Company No.
06950554); the shareholders exchanged their shares in H+Energy Ltd for       shares in Ortus Energy       Ltd.     Impacts on schools and creative professions:       Educational practices have changed outside the submitting unit:       Based on the BPV technology, an educational toolkit (for interdisciplinary       training in photosynthesis,       (electro)chemistry, experimental design, and for raising energy awareness)       has been developed,       and has been trialled with a group of students at Hills Road 6th       Form College, Cambridge, in July       2013.
The trial elicited high interest from the students, and Hills Road 6th       Form College have       decided to use the tool for student group projects (Ref.
9, Section 5).
Professionals have used research findings in conducting their work:       A London-based designer was researching new ways of generating power in       2011.
She testifies:       "As a designer interested &#8212; but not necessarily an expert &#8212; in technology,       I eagerly delved into the       BPV research published by a team around Prof. Chris Howe of the University       of Cambridge.
I       started a collaboration with Paolo Bombelli from the Howe group in 2012,       about integrating BPV       into a futuristic scenario of how plants (in this case bryophytes) might       be used.
This led to us in       2013 jointly developing a moss-powered radio which is now being       exhibited."
(Ref.
10, Section 5).
A Norfolk-based architect bureau, MCMM Architettura Ltd, has approached       the Howe group in       2013 with an interest in integrating the BPV technology into architectural       designs.
The architect is       now working with members of the Howe group on an installation for the       e-Luminate Festival 2014       (Ref.
11, Section 5).
