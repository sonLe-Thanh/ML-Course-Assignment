     Pathway to Impact: The research has resulted in significant       developments relating to the care and treatment of extremely premature       babies and to an enhanced role for parental decision making.
It has been       deliberated upon, and adapted through the applied policy recommendations       contained within a ground-breaking NCOB report [A]; overseen by Professor       Brazier, who was invited to chair the NCOB working party, and co-opted as       a member of the council to facilitate communication between the two, a       task achieved with "considerable skill... [that] made a         significant contribution to other discussions and debates within the         council" .
As the Director of the NCOB goes on to attest, the       invitation was originally offered, in 2004, on the basis of Professor       Brazier's "considerable academic record and experience in chairing         other major committees which gave her a knowledge of the wider policy         environment" [1].
Under her leadership the NCOB conducted further multi-disciplinary       research.
As the (then) Chair of the NCOB confirms, "Professor Brazier         played a key role in the drafting of the Report, and it was her own         research which moulded the contents of the Report and the important         recommendations made by the Working Party and endorsed by the Council"       [2].
An extensive programme of consultation was initiated, including       European debate, which sought the view of parents, professionals and NHS       managers.
The report played a major role in the amendment and development       of professional guidelines and good practice, and was subsequently       summarised via an editorial piece in the Journal of Medical Ethics       [3].
Impact of NCOB Report: As the co-author of the JME piece attests       Professor Brazier's role was "pivotal in the success of the report...         a report that integrated a wealth of findings into a coherent and         compelling narrative with a set of clear suggestions for policy... its         success led to its having a huge influence across the relevant domains         of medical practice and policy regulation.
No organisation or individual         concerned with the matters under review ignores it, and most cite it as         a canonical statement of what can be and what ought to be done" [3].
More specifically, Professor Brazier contributed to the chapter on ethics,       and researched and drafted chapter eight on law, as well as supervising       the overall production of the final report.
Although, as a member of the       working party (and former President of BAPM) testifies, whilst Professor       Brazier's "contribution was formally in the section on Legal         issues, which was one of the cornerstones of the final document... her         perceptive inputs to the remainder of the document and her ability to         steer a big multidisciplinary group to consensus were most impressive.
She was a highly active contributor and challenger throughout the         process" [4].
The report resulted in a high level of media interest which promoted       vigorous public and professional debate, and kept the subject on the       public and professional agenda.
Professor Brazier gave a number of public       lectures, took part in the BBC radio programmes `Today' and `The Moral       Maze' and was interviewed by several newspapers, including The Telegraph,       and The Independent [5].
More recently, the report featured in the BBC2       documentary `23 Week Babies: The Price of Life' (2010) watched by 2.02       million viewers [1][6].
Within the NCOB report, detailed guidance was offered to assist in the       definition of `best interests', and amongst the report's main         recommendations were that:            Guidance should reflect the current medical understanding of the         prospects for survival and the incidence of disability for babies born         extremely prematurely.
From 24 weeks gestation the presumption should be that intensive         neonatal support should be instituted for the baby.
From 23-24 weeks precedence should be given to parental wishes.
From 22-23 weeks intensive neonatal support should not be instituted         unless the parents make a fully informed and re-iterated request.
Below 22 weeks no baby should be resuscitated save with the fully         informed consent of both parents and within an approved clinical trial.
To minimise recourse to traumatic legal proceedings, the parties         should have readier access to clinical ethics committees.
Bioethics mediation, now utilised in parts of the USA, should be         introduced in the UK.
Reach and Significance: The NCOB Report is now cited in virtually       all accounts and debates relating to the care of extremely premature       babies - 176 articles and 10 legal documents since 2006 [2] - and has been       downloaded at least 2,212 times (with 23,274 page views) since September       2010 (no download data is available prior to this time) [1][7].
As the NCOB director confirms: "The British Association of Perinatal         Medicine (BAPM) and several other organisations took up the Council's         recommendations and worked together to draw up new medical guidance in         2008 on the management of extremely premature babies, closely following         the recommendations made in the Council's report" [1].
This is       recognised by BAPM in their palliative care framework:     Recent guidance from the Nuffield Council of Bioethics (Nuffield 2006)         and the British Association of Perinatal Medicine working group on the         clinical care of extremely preterm infants supports the decisions of         clinical staff and parents not to resuscitate or institute intensive         care when this would not be in the baby's best interests.
The Department         of Health is developing guidance on end-of-life care for adults but not         yet for the fetus, neonate, or infant.
[8]     As the BAPM secretary noted at the time: "the Nuffield Council for         Bioethics advised us to develop an update to our previous document         (2001).
We were able to discuss the draft with members of the NCoB         Working Group in December and are delighted that they were very         supportive of the progress and direction of the framework" (BAPM       Newsletter).
This led to the BAPM promulgating guidance on `The Management       of Babies Born Extremely Preterm...' in August 2008, which remains in       place to this day [8].
As noted, it closely follows NCOB guidance, and       thus represents the translation of research into practical impact in       neonatal care.
Crucially, the BAPM framework mirrors the NCOB timeline and       the criteria to be utilised in the assessment of `best interests'.
The       former President of BAPM confirms that the NCOB report significantly       influenced BAPM, and that the ensuing guidelines have had an impact on       practice in neonatal care:     "This document remains the reference document in a range of settings         and is very frequently quoted in talks and publications as the benchmark         in the field.
No lecture on perinatal ethics in this country or abroad         fails to refer to it, even if it is just as a starting point.
The         document formed the basis of the professional document prepared under         the aegis of BAPM, RCPCH, RCOG, RCM, and RCN, entitled Management of         babies born extremely preterm at less than 26 weeks of gestation: a         framework for clinical practice at the time of birth, published in         Archives of Disease in Childhood, which is still the mainstay of UK         policy today...
The document from this working group remains one of the         most influential documents in perinatal care since it was published and         required reading for all trainees in the area."
[3]     The report has also been considered in detail by the Royal College of       Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) &#8212; with a recognition that the       Nuffield "recommendations have recently been considered and adopted in         the development of a professional framework for care" [9] -and       welcomed by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), who       noted that the "advice is consistent with the current RCPCH framework         for `Withholding or Withdrawing Life Sustaining Treatment' (2004)"       [10].
In conclusion, the NCOB Guidelines draw heavily on Professor Brazier's       prior work and her individual and steering contribution to the NCOB       report.
Furthermore, impacts are clearly on-going as a recent article       (2012) in the Telegraph attests; "with no legal definition of 'viable'         when it comes to premature babies", an experienced neonatal       consultant observes that:     "...most decisions he and the unit take are based on guidelines from         the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, revised by the British Association of         Perinatal Medicine.
The guide states that before 22 weeks 'any         intervention is experimental', and should only happen within a 'clinical         research study that has been assessed and approved by a research ethics         committee and with informed parental consent.'"
[5]     The research continues to influence debate, with particular respect to:       firstly, criteria that should guide decisions on resuscitation; secondly,       how to give more concrete guidance on best interests; and thirdly, how to       promote partnership between parents and professionals, noting how       communication breakdown could trigger legal conflict.
