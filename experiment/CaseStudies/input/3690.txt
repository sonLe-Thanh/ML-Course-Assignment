     The Litpop bookclub at The Sage Gateshead has run continuously from 2011,       connected to the Sage's education programme.
It was set up with the       intention of raising appreciation amongst a non-academic audience of the       findings emerging from Hansen's 2010 monograph.
In particular,       participants were encouraged to jettison their preconceptions and to       consider afresh the distinction and barriers between different forms of       culture.
Hansen encouraged those involved to value their own responses to       popular music influenced by the work of literary figures, as well as to       `literary' writing influenced by popular music.
The club has also branched       out recently with a spin-off meeting at the Darlington For Culture       Festival (May 2013) and a Litpop Workshop delivered at the Star and Shadow       Cinema, Newcastle upon Tyne, April 2013.
Hansen has also delivered public       talks at The Sage Gateshead as part of their `Exploring Music' series in       April 2012 and February 2013, and in May 2011 delivered a lecture on       Shakespeare and popular music at Newcastle's Literary and Philosophical       Society to an audience of 30 (the subsequent podcast has received 86 plays       and 9 downloads (source 8)).
All these events have created an opportunity       for him to engage audiences with the ideas at the heart of his study on Shakespeare         and Popular Music: namely the links between writing and music, and       the popular and the elite.
His research has impacted upon readers, writers       and musicians in the North East of England in these two ways:            The Litpop bookclub benefited its host institutions' engagements           with their audiences, while also improving public understanding of the           links between literature and popular music, and high culture and           popular culture.
The Litpop bookclub was never intended to be a standard reading group.
Established at The Sage Gateshead, one of the premier musical venues in       the UK, and appealing to an audience with musical tastes as much as       bookish ones, it attempted to bring the worlds of literature and music       together.
Sessions featured music playlists brought in (and heard) by       participants and often followed participants' recommendations for books.
The books also needed to have musical references or themes, ensuring that       the relation between music and writing was constantly stressed.
The       sessions were participant-led, but discussion was framed and underpinned       by Hansen's work on the relations between writing and popular music.
The       bookclub has been of particular benefit to The Sage Gateshead in terms of       diversifying its programme of events: since the club's inception 168       people (Oct 2011 to August 2013: figure from the Sage) have attended at       least one session, of whom 10% have been classed as new bookers or       non-regular attendees.
This has helped the Sage meet its strategic       objectives.
The Cross-Strand Programme Manager at the Sage affirmed that:       `The Litpop Book Club has helped to expand the [Sage's] education         programme...by offering participants a unique forum to combine their         interests in literature and popular music &#8212; we are not aware of another         book club of this nature in the region &#8212; and to help fulfil The Sage         Gateshead's mission: to entertain, involve and inspire each and every         person we meet' (source 1).
The Chair of Darlington For Culture       Festival, echoed this perception of the value of the bookclub for his       Festival: `Book clubs are a key part of any literary festival and the         Litpop one added something extra' (source 2).
Reflecting on the       Litpop workshop and performance, The Star and Shadow Cinema confirmed that       `several performers...had never been to the...Cinema before, and having         new artists come to the cinema is crucial to the survival of our venue',       since one of the `strategic aims of the cinema' is `to...help         with the creation of new and challenging work'.
The Cinema reported       that attendance for the evening performance was `very good'       because `many members of the audience had never been to the cinema         before' and in that sense, `this event greatly helped the cinema         to grow and diversify its audience' (source 3).The bookclub has had       beneficial impacts for participants, in terms of fostering new       appreciation of the links between writing and popular music and of the       complex relation between elite and popular culture.
One Sage bookclub       participant observed that `[my] view has changed positively towards         associating writing with music' and that the book club has         `broadened my knowledge'.
Another affirmed `I enjoy the         opportunity to develop my thinking on the linkage between words and         music'.
One comment summed up much of the feedback: `The books         chosen have helped me discover writers I probably never would read         otherwise, &amp; discover new perspectives'.
Responses after the       Darlington book club similarly indicated that the event `Developed my         understanding of how poetry operates within music' (source 6).
The Litpop workshop, performance and public talks helped musicians           and writers to generate new forms of creative expression, in doing so           enriching the imaginations and lives of individuals and groups          The Litpop workshop at the Star and Shadow Cinema brought together a       small group of local musicians and writers in order to share their       practice.
The event was designed as an experiment in music speaking to       writing.
Guided by resources provided by Hansen, the seven writers and       musicians worked together on a new verbal and musical composition,       subsequently performing this in public at the Cinema.
Participants noted       changes in their own creative practices as a result of the workshop, and       due to specific exercises involving musical adaptations of Shakespearean       sonnets: `I can see clear links between how writers may use music         either as inspiration for pieces of writing or as accompaniment to         writing'; `I have new ideas for pieces of music related writing';       `My understanding of how others relate to music and how they go about         writing the content of their songs has been greatly expanded'.
One       participant said they would try `experimenting more within my writing         &#8212; using musical forms', while another asserted that the event had       the benefit of `boosting my confidence, widening my creative         perspective' (source 7).
They also benefited from the opportunity       for collaboration: `it was good to meet collectively'; `[I         benefited] by having time &amp; opportunity to work with other writers         &amp; musicians, observe their creative process and be inspired by their         work'.
Hansen's public talks at The Sage Gateshead (as part of their `Exploring       Music' series in April 2012 and February 2013) involved working with       people in non-HEI contexts to illuminate and challenge cultural values and       assumptions.
These talks addressed popular music and literature,       particularly the writings of Shakespeare: 42 people participated of whom a       fifth were new bookers or non-regular attendees (source 1).
Subsequently,       17 out of 19 questionnaire respondents from the audience for the 2012 talk       affirmed that their view and/or knowledge of Shakespeare and/or popular       music had changed as a result of the talk; and the same number agreed that       the talk had had a `positive impact' on their understanding of Shakespeare       and popular music.
Comments suggested respondents recognised what they       termed the `connectivity' and `juxtaposition' because the       material was `original', `thought-provoking', and `awakened         unexplored thoughts', by presenting ideas participants `hadn't         previously considered' or `would never have linked'.
This       included the notion, for example, that `maybe rappers have an insight'.
Where one respondent noted the talk `challenged me to examine...more         deeply', another summed up the majority of responses: `It has         made me consider how `elite' Shakespeare is viewed which perhaps         intimidates people &#8212; can popular music break through this fear?'
(source 4).
By beginning to ask these questions, participants showed       evidence of the impact of the research undertaken.
Questionnaires       collected after the 2013 talk affirmed the session had benefited the way       attendees saw the links between writing and popular music and that the       talk would change the way they read about and listened to music.
One noted       that the talk had `Enhanced my thinking on the links between music,         writing and identity'; another suggested the talk `Made me         re-evaluate the way I connect lit/music' (source 5).
Reflecting on       the impact of these talks, combined with the book club, the Cross-Strand       Programme Manager at the Sage states that `Adam's involvement with The         Sage Gateshead has been beneficial to both the programmes and         participants &#8212; both the Exploring Music talks and the LitPop Book Club,         led by Adam's specialist knowledge and enthusiasm, have engaged with new         audiences who have continued their own musical journeys by attending         other programmes' (source 1).
