     The analysis provided by QUMS researchers at the request of the Charity       Commission and OSCR strongly influenced the SORP Committee's review and       amendment of the present (2005) SORP.
A new SORP, has now been drafted and       is out for consultation drawing heavily on the QUMS research.
In the foreword to the 2009 report, Charity Reporting and Accounting:         Taking Stock and Future Reform, Andrew Hind (Chief Executive,       Charity Commission) and Jane Ryder (Chief Executive, OSCR) wrote:     "The Charity Commission and the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator,       as the joint SORP-making body, welcome this insightful and independent       analysis of the SORP research undertaken with the assistance of the SORP       Committee and our sector partners....We would like to thank Professor Noel       Hyndman and the team at Queen's University Belfast for their report... We       commend this thoughtful report.... As the evidence demonstrates,       high-quality charity reporting is essential to maintaining public       confidence in the work of charities."
The impact of the QUMS research is evidenced in the minutes of SORP       Committee, which are publicly available.
Two of many examples of extracts       from these minutes that show the impact of the research are:     Minutes of 22nd September 2009       "3.8 The Committee concluded that:       - The findings of the report were extremely valuable in identifying the       strengths of SORP and those       areas where improvements could be made;       - The outcome should be shared with the sector.
The Charity Commission and       OSCR will publish       the report as the joint SORP making body, acknowledging the role of       Queen's University Belfast, in       analysing and summarising the findings;       - The overwhelming support for SORP shows that a SORP or similar framework       is essential to       underpin confidence in charity reporting and accounting."
Minutes of 13th October 2010       "Item 7: New SORP module &#8212; Fund Accounting       7.1 Nigel Davies introduced this module.
He noted that the 2008-09 SORP       research findings had identified that the analysis of funds was an       essential aspect of charity accounting and that real difficulties existed       in practice in properly identifying the funds held."
The research has also been widely cited and used by other accounting       bodies.
The Charity Commission has cited Charity Reporting and Accounting:         Taking Stock and Future Reform in responses to a range of       consultations to outside parties, including to the:            Accounting Standards Board consultation on the future of UK GAPP on         27th January 2010;       Financial Reporting Council's discussion paper Cutting Clutter         on 30th September 2011; and       the International Accounting Standards Board in their 'Exposure Draft:         revenue from contracts with customers' on 9th January 2012.
In addition, it has been promoted and used by other parties, including:            the Welsh Audit Office in responding to the Accounting Standards Board         consultation on the future of UK GAPP (26th January 2010); and       Howieson, B. in an agenda paper to the Australian Accounting Standards         Board `Defining the Reporting Entity in the Not-for-Profit Private           Sector (including consideration of the concept of control) Part 1 of           Phase 1 &#8212; Identification of Issues Associated with the Application of           Control' at their meeting of 18-19 April 2012.
