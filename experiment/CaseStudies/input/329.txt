     The reach and significance of the research can be clearly       demonstrated by the way Thorpe has worked with a major international       agency and international donors to influence fisheries policy across       several countries.
The research has contributed to legislative change,       shaped sectoral development strategy, and influenced international donor       investment (Impact 1); helped underpin the scientific and technical       work programme of a newly-established UN fisheries body (Impact 2);       and provided technical inputs and expert training for a capacity-building       programme on fish supply chains (Impact 3).
Impact 1 (Public Policy): Legislative Change and Influencing National         Fisheries Policy       Thorpe was despatched to Kyrgyzstan in September 2007 by the FAO (project       P2) to undertake base-line research and to then help coordinate the first       National Workshop on Fisheries and Food Security involving 53 key       stakeholders - including the Minister of Agriculture and two cabinet       officials (Corroborating Source - CS1).
These inputs fed into the       completion of the first ever FAO National Fisheries Review published in       mid-2008 which Thorpe played a significant role in drafting.
Thorpe's role       was to collate, synthesise and relate the ideas emerging from local       stakeholders with established practice elsewhere in the field of poverty       reduction and fisheries governance (R1), `drafting the notes of the       September [2007] meeting that started the ball rolling' in the eyes of the       FAO regional Fisheries and Aquaculture officer (Corroborating Person -       CP1).
The Director of Fisheries of the Kyrgyz Republic (Letter - CP2)       acknowledges that `Thorpe's work helped underpin many of the policies       espoused' in the first National Strategy for Fisheries and Aquaculture         Sector Development and Management in the Kyrgyz Republic 2008-2012       (NSFASM).
The legislative change that ensued (April 2008 Law - CS2)       resulted in the decriminalisation of artisanal fishing -affecting an       estimated 100,000 individuals who were transformed from `poachers' into       legitimate artisanal and recreational fishers.
This change had been       strongly advocated by Thorpe in both the Review and in subsequently       published research (R3) as was acknowledged by the FAO officer and the       Director of Fisheries (CP1 and CP2).
Impact 2 (Public Policy): Shaping Restocking Policy of a Regional FAO         Fisheries Body.
The success of this project (P2) prompted the FAO into scaling-up its       activities in the region, successfully soliciting US$1.9 million for a       five year (2009-2014) Central Asia Regional Programme for Fisheries         and Aquaculture Development under the FAO Turkey Partnership in 2008       (Project Document - CS3).
Significantly, the background section of the       `project design' component of this partnership project (p.9-10) employed       both the precise wording employed by Thorpe in R3 (Introduction) and also       borrowed the preliminary findings of Thorpe's research into regional       inland fisheries livelihoods (R5) to articulate priority intervention       needs (CS3 - p.13).
As a result, Thorpe and his colleagues (Whitmarsh and       Drakeford) were invited to study the potential for aquaculture development       in the region under Output 4.3 of the project.
The findings of this new       study (R6) were presented to the Fourth Inter-governmental Meeting       convened to establish the Central Asian and Caucasus Regional Fisheries       and Aquaculture Commission (CACFish) in June 2011.
The meeting       acknowledged the high quality of this research, agreed with the       overarching principles proposed to guide future regional culture-based       fisheries and stocking activity, and accepted the importance of       implementing simple - yet pragmatic - national regulatory frameworks       across the region (Report CS4 - paragraphs 46-8).
The inaugural meeting of       CACFish in Ankara in December 2011 (Report - CS5, p.41) put on record the       need for members to prioritise restocking and developing culture-based       fisheries in the region in line with the recommendations made by Thorpe       and colleagues (R6).
Additionally, `the comprehensive, detailed,       recommendations provided [by Thorpe and colleagues] ...are likely to       remain the cornerstones upon which future regional fisheries policies will       be built' (CP1).
Impact 3 (Economic/Commercial): Development of Improved Aquacultural         Production Practices.
In response to this CACFish directive the Kyrgyz government requested       support from the FAO to develop a functional fish supply chain for the       commercial cultivation of trout and capture fisheries.
Drakeford was       consequently contracted to review the current fish supply chain, lead a       national capacity-building workshop (early 2013) and advise on a national       development programme designed to enhance domestic production practices       and add value across the whole supply chain.
The development of such       academic-industry events was acknowledged as an imperative first step in       addressing the countries nutritional deficit by the Team Leader of the       FAO/Finnish fisheries support programme (Letter - CP3).
In summary, the field research and associated publications were not only       instrumental in causing significant legislative change which reached - and       decriminalised - an estimated 100,000 artisanal and recreational fishers       in Kyrgyzstan, but also played a fundamental role in the establishment of       a new FAO regional fisheries body (CACFISH) and has contributed to       enhanced domestic fish production practices in Kyrgyzstan.
The research       also led to the publication of the first ever FAO National Fisheries       Reviews of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and two FAO Technical reports on       fisher livelihoods and the feasibility of culture-based fisheries in the       region.
