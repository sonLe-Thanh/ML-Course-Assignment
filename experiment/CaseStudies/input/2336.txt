     The principal impact of Dawson's work has been on the development of         public health ethics         frameworks, which have led to changes to policy and professional       behaviour around the       implementation of public health ethics programmes.
In addition to the       impact of his publications, he       has also used his research when acting as a consultant on expert advisory       panels.
The research       and public engagement have influenced each other.
(a) World Health Organisation Task Force: Ethical Guidance for           Tuberculosis interventions       As a result of his research on bioethics, vaccinations and infectious       diseases, Professor Dawson       was appointed as one of the twenty-two Expert Members of the World Health       Organisation (WHO)       Task Force on Addressing Ethical Issues in Tuberculosis Care and         Control Programmes, which       was formed in 2008.
The Task Force was required to complete a       comprehensive analysis of the       ethical issues in TB and formulate and produce guidance.
The resulting       document, Guidance on         ethics of tuberculosis prevention, care and control [source 1], was       published in Dec 2010 with the       purpose of providing governments and other stakeholders with guidance on       how to implement TB       care and control programmes in an ethical way [source 2].
Dawson wrote the       first draft of the       section on values at the start of the document (a fifth of the total text)       and his definition of public       health is used centrally in the document to identify the need for       co-ordinated action to generate       conditions in which all members of the community are protected (p. 6).
This document provides the       ethical reasoning for the collectively organised (public health) action on       TB that the WHO       advocate, and adds significant weight to the WHO argument that access to       TB care is a global       welfare right that governments have a duty to provide.
The impact of this       document has been       substantial in the attention that has been paid to it by the target       audience; for example, it is cited by       Public Health England as a key document on TB for Health Workers [source       3]; its impact       continues as this document is still used today as a basis of training       workshops focused on frontline       medical staff and national policy makers by WHO's Stop TB campaign all       around the world.
(b) A Public Health Ethics Framework: Ontario, Canada       Public Health Ontario is responsible for all aspects of public health       activity in Ontario (the most       populous province in Canada).
Dawson was one of six members of the       Conceptual Framework       Working Group.
The group's first publication was a consultation document An         Ethical Framework         for Public Health Projects: A Discussion Paper.
The document uses       Verweij and Dawson's       definition of Public Health as a key definition (2011, source 4, p. 3).
This was circulated to various       public health professionals and academics in the Province.
This discussion       paper and subsequent       feedback was then used to inform the development of a framework in 2012, A         Framework for the         Ethical Conduct of Public Health Initiatives [source 5], to `guide       the ethical conduct of evidence-generating       public health initiatives'.
This white paper adopts the public health       framework approach       of Dawson whereby questions are used to examine the issues and to consider       the interests of all       stakeholders, particularly emphasising the positive obligation to promote       equality and reciprocity       [source 5].
It cites Dawson and his work throughout, in particular drawing       on his research to       demonstrate the need to develop a framework specifically for public health       ethics (p. 6) and to       explain how the framework is necessary for providing guidance to determine       when public health       interventions may restrict individual autonomy (p. 7).
This framework has       been useful in guiding       Public Health Ontario (PHO) in the development of a new ethics review       approach, with the       framework being used to guide investigators in the ethical reflection of       core principles in the       planning and review of evidence-generating public health initiatives, for       example in program       evaluation, surveillance, quality improvement activities, and public       health research.
This approach       is currently being piloted by Public Health Ontario staff through a suite       of ethics support services       which include (1) ethics advisory services, (2) ethics education, (3)       public health ethics resources       and (4) ethics review process and board, and so is used by public health       professionals in Ontario       on a daily basis [source 6].
(c) British Medical Association: Advice on Hepatitis B vaccination              Dawson's research has influenced debate among medical practitioners about       universal       vaccination.
An article by Dawson in The Lancet (Dawson, 2005)       advocates the universal       immunisation of children in low-risk countries, such as the UK, as a       preventative measure against       the dangers posed by this quickly spreading disease based on his wider       arguments about public       health.
This appears as a key citation in the British Medical       Association's policy on "Hepatitis       vaccination in childhood" [source 7], in support of their call for       universal immunisation.
When it was       first published in 2006 (subsequently updated, in 2010) it received wide       media attention [source 8].
Dawson's article is also cited in a paper on childhood vaccinations       [source 9] in a practitioner       journal for paediatricians and health care professionals.
The paper       advocates Hep B childhood       vaccinations and uses Dawson's article to support this argument.
(d) M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res (MSF) Ethics Review Board       Dawson has been a member of M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res Ethics Review Board       (MSF ERB) since       2009.
The ERB reviews all MSF research (used by MSF to improve its       clinical practice and       advocacy work) and provides guidance on working/practical issues and       policies.
In 2013 the ERB       produced a new document entitled Ethical Guidelines for Research.
This document was largely       written by Dawson and adopts his approach to frameworks (Dawson 2009) &#8212; a       series of ordered       questions to facilitate deliberation by researchers and other non-experts       &#8212; about how to produce       ethical research.
This is now the key document for discussing ethics in       all research conducted by       or sponsored by MSF [source 10].
Outlined here are specific examples where Dawson has had significant       impact on the development       of particular approaches to addressing public health ethics.
But by       establishing public health ethics       as a distinct sub-discipline within bioethics (for example, through       establishing the key Public Health       Ethics Journal and editing collections of papers) Dawson has been       instrumental in the construction       of public health ethics in itself and therefore has facilitated the       impacts of others working in the       field.
Examples include references to his work in reports on Polio       vaccination campaigns in India       [Source 11] and being commissioned by the Centers for Disease           Control and Prevention         (CDC), a US federal agency, to help shape a White paper on       the ethics of public health       emergencies [source 12].
