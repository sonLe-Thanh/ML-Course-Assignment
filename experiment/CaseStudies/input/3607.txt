     The archival research outlined above has had significant impacts within       Portugal on public understanding of and engagement with the country's       ambiguous role in World War II, particularly its negotiation as a neutral       power and its relationship with Jewish refugees from the Holocaust.
This       was achieved primarily through the publication of Lisbon: War in the         Shadows of the City of Light, 1939-1945, Neill Lochery's book, based       on his archival research.
Lisbon appeared in English in November       2011; six months later it was published in Portuguese by Editorial       Presen&#231;a, a major publishing house and, in May 2013, in Spanish.
Uniquely       amongst histories with a popular readership, it provides an inside view of       the discussions within the Salazar administration and in Allied diplomatic       correspondence, based on many years of primary research using unpublished       archival material.
The book received immediate critical acclaim through reviews in major       Portuguese newspapers, as well as in widely-read political, literary and       lifestyle magazines including:     - Expresso Actual, `Mis&#233;rias liter&#225;rias' 16 June 2012.
4*       review in culture supplement of top weekly newspaper with a circulation of       140k.
- Time Out Lisbon, `Lisboa em tempos de guerra' 20 June 2012.
4*       review in weekly events magazine, circulation of 13,100 per week.
- Di&#225;rio de Not&#237;cias, `Algo de Scott Fitzgerald' 19 July 2012.
Top daily paper, circulation of 34k in 2011.
[1]     These uniformly positive reviews recognised the unique contribution of       Lochery's research to Portuguese citizens' understanding of this important       passage in their country's history.
For example, the 4-star Expresso       noted that:     "Lochery understands that Salazar is a controversial figure, and the       merit of his book (for the Portuguese) is to show in detail the double       dealing; the complex politics of the former dictators policy of `flexible       neutrality', which both annoyed or reassured the Allies and the Germans,       while at the same time he kept an eye on Spain and did not lose sight of       the internal opposition [in Portugal]."
Translated from the original         Portuguese [1]     In addition, excellent reviews were received in widely-read publications       in the English-speaking world, including:     - The Wall Street Journal (3 Dec 2011), which wrote of Lisbon       that it "... traces the subtlety of [Salazar's] manoeuvring with clarity       and precision.
Distilling an enormous quantity of research, he [Lochery]       has rendered a fascinating and readable account of this small country's       role in World War II, protected, as it was, by its wily champion".

[1]     By May 2013, some 7,000 copies of the Portuguese version had been sold,       with the book nearing the end of its third edition.
The extent and       significance of public interest aroused in Portugal by the book is evident       in Lochery's many invitations to follow-up activities, including invited       talks to:     - An audience of approximately 200 secondary school pupils and parents at       St Julian's, Lisbon.
Nov 2011.
- Students, journalists and the general public at the Wars and Cities       conference, New University of Lisbon and Camara Municipal, 15 Sept 2012.
- A general public audience at Camara Municipal de Lisboa (city hall), 25       Oct 2012.
Most significantly, the book's success inspired a group of public and       private sector sponsors to support a highly successful free photographic       exhibition titled `Lisbon: Bottleneck of Europe in WWII: 1939-1945'.
Held       at the Camara Municipal and opened by the Mayor of Lisbon on the evening       of 17 October 2012, the exhibition presented many of the historic       photographs and other documents identified by Lochery in the course of his       research [2].
A cocktail reception for 185 guests was hosted by Societ&#233;       G&#233;n&#233;rale Private Banking, in association with Pernod Ricard Portugal and       Mont Blanc Iberia, attended by ambassadors from several European countries       and the United States, as well as by business leaders and arts       professionals.
The interest and enjoyment taken by attendees in this new       exhibition of artistic resources is evident in the following comments,       extracted from the Exhibition Report prepared after its close:     - `Casts new light upon Lisbon's unique role during those terrible years'       &#8212; Partner, Morais Leitao, Galv&#227;o Teles, Soares da Silva &amp; Associados       legal firm.
- `An impressive and unique portrait of the Portuguese capital in the       1940s' &#8212; Centro do Historia BES.
- `Very interesting and diversified display of documents, most of them       previously undisclosed to public eye' &#8212; Head of International, Montepio       Bank.
- `Especially wonderful to see and to have on display for the first time       new documents uncovered on Peggy Guggenheim and her family' &#8212; President,       Peggy Guggenheim Collection Advisory Board.
[4, p11]     A 56-page catalogue documenting the exhibition was published in an       edition of 550 copies, with sponsorship from the Soci&#233;t&#233; G&#233;n&#233;rale bank, as       part of efforts to fulfil its commitment to supporting artistic progress;       the bank itself distributed 200 copies to its own guests at the opening       reception.
The remainder were sold through the gift shop, distributed by       the mayor as gifts, and provided to Lisbon's municipal libraries [3].
The exhibition and catalogue successfully engaged a large Lisboan public       with new archival research on their city's murky history during World War       II.
Although the exhibition was free and the precise visitor numbers were       not collected, a three-week tracking exercise found that on average the       gallery had 1,500 to 2,000 visitors per week, giving an estimated total of       10,500-14,000 visitors over the course of the relatively short run [4, p.       10].
A visitor survey found that whilst the greatest number of visitors       were Portuguese, many other nationalities (notably British, American and       Spanish) were also represented [4].
While all age groups were evenly       represented, several schools benefitted particularly from the provision of       guided educational tours for Year 6 pupils (age 10-11) to support the       national curriculum of WW2 studies, as well as tours for students in       continuing education and civics.
In particular, educational resources,       such as quizzes, were developed to help teach WW2 history through the       exhibition.
One head teacher remarked: `...the students have just returned       from Lisbon, full of enthusiasm for the way they were looked after on       their visit to the exhibition &#8212; and found it instructive, attractive,       poignant and uplifting &#8212; as all good History should be.'
[4, p. 11]     The exhibition received substantial and enthusiastic press coverage, with       long and detailed features appeared in at least 10 major Portuguese       language national and city newspapers, with a combined circulation of over       a million, a tenth of the population of Portugal.
Examples include:     - Expresso Revista `Lisboa j&#225; foi Casablanca' 20 Oct 2012 (a 4       page interview feature in weekend magazine, circulation 140k per issue).
- Jornal de negocios `Lisboa, "Casablanca" de Salazar' 26 Oct       2012 (3 page interview feature in this daily newspaper, circulation 300k       per issue).
- Time Out Lisbon feature and Top 3 Time Out Choice (weeks of 18       and 25 Oct 2012).
[3]     This was accompanied by widespread broadcast coverage, including:     - Primetime evening news broadcast on SIC News (national commercial TV)       23 Oct 2012.
- Lunchtime News broadcast on RTP News (national state news) 24 Oct 2012,       repeated in `Good Morning News' the following day.
- Antena 1 (national state radio) 23 Oct 2012.
[4]     Coverage continued well after the exhibition's end, demonstrating the       ongoing impact on media discourse; for example, Diario Economico,       the country's premier financial newspaper, published a 4-page article and       interview in its monthly magazine supplement in March 2013.
[5]     However, the greatest indicator of the strength and scale of public       interest in the exhibition itself and in the social, historical and       political issues that it raised is its extension of the exhibition &#8212; due       to public demand &#8212; beyond the initial four weeks to seven weeks; it       eventually closed on 30 November 2012.
The significance of the associated       public engagement activities is also witnessed by the fact that the       exhibition has consistently contributed to the visitor service and tourist       experience in Lisbon.
Thus the Portuguese Tourist Board, for example, used       the story told in Lisbon of the refugees passing through Europe to       develop interest in the sights of this city by making it the focus, in       March 2012, of its regular `This Month's Travel Secret' feature, [6] and       in May 2013, the National World War II Museum in New Orleans (USA),       announced it had invited Lochery to present a talk and private exhibition       viewing of Lisbon for 300 passengers on a cruise commemorating the       70th anniversary of the D-Day Landings the following year.
