     Pathway to Impact: The pathway to impact from this research is       primarily via Dr Salo's broad and       significant involvement in applied work with practitioners.
Dr Salo's       close working relationship with       UK Athletics has allowed him to translate the acquired knowledge directly       to the very highest level       of the sport.
While research on elite athletes is inherently difficult and       changes are in most cases       practically impossible to quantify at the athlete level due to so many       extraneous variables, it can be       clearly demonstrated that UK Athletics and British Bob Skeleton have       changed their practices, and       that both coaches and athletes appreciate and value the insights drawn       from Dr Salo's work.
Using research to inform professional work and practice: The       research from paper 1 improved       understanding of key issues in 4x100 m relay exchanges and how to measure       these baton       exchanges.
Based on this research, Dr Salo created a videotaping and       analysis template that has       been used by UK Athletics over the last 10 years.
This work also prompted       UK Athletics to adapt       and develop a new approach which included inviting and supporting Dr Salo       to attend pre-competition       training camps and to be part of the support team at major Championships.
During the       current REF cycle, Dr Salo has analysed over 90% of all British national       senior relay team activities       (52 relay training sessions and 49 relay competitions).
These include the       following preparation       camps and Championships: Beijing Olympics 2008, Berlin World Championships       2009, Barcelona       European Championships 2010, Daegu World Championships 2011 and London       Olympics 2012       [15].
Notably, Dr Salo was the only biomechanical technical personnel in       the whole of Team GB for       the Beijing Olympics in 2008 [16].
During these preparation camps and the Championships, Dr Salo worked with       the best British       athletes and their coaches &#8212; advising and supporting their preparations       for better performances.
Adding the aforementioned relay work (based on paper 1), he has also been       able to translate the       research knowledge from papers 2 (hurdling), 3 (sprinting) and 4 (sprint       start) to advise athletes'       technique in the training camp environment.
Over 100 top British sprinters       and hurdlers and their       coaches have received analysis and feedback from Dr Salo in the last 5       years (i.e.
all those who       have represented Great Britain in major Championships).
His work and input       have been publicly       appreciated by athletes including a quote from British World Championship       medal sprinter Harry       Aikines-Aryeetey in an article in The Washington Post in summer 2012: "He         films all our (baton)         exchanges and then goes off to calculate how much faster we could go if         we did things differently.
Getting his feedback gives us confidence we're doing the right things         and everything possible to         win a medal" [17].
Further, the UK Athletics Performance Director       stated: "He has made a valuable         contribution to inform coaches and athletes on performances across all         speed events with a very         direct contribution, for example, towards British men's 4x100 m relay         team winning a World         Championships bronze medal in Berlin 2009."
[15].
Dr Salo's       translational research and role as       part of the UK Athletics support team is unique in British HEIs in       relation to athletics.
Influence on professional training and enhance professional practice:       Dr Salo has been       invited to participate in off-the-track work as an invited speaker for UK       Athletics workshops (during       the current REF cycle in Novembers 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011) providing       education for athletes       and top coaches about relay running (paper 1).
Each workshop included up       to 10 of the best male       and female sprinters in the UK.
The purpose of these workshops was to go       through performances       from the previous summer and to learn lessons for the future.
While the       target audience as top       athletes is inevitably limited by the elite nature of the group, the same       message reaches broader       audiences via the coaches, as they coach wider groups of athletes       (including youth).
Further       workshops have been held for hurdle coaches in November 2011 and December       2012 (15-20       coaches in each).
Key topics in these presentations were the further       insight into hurdling technique       found in paper 2 (technique changes when fatigued and how take-off       distances are related to       running velocity).
These workshops were the first time that these issues       had been introduced into       formal coach education in the UK.
The National Event coach for hurdles at       UK Athletics (who has       personally coached athletes to ten Olympic or World Championship Gold       medals) has utilised this       insight in his coaching over the last few years: "I have worked with Dr         Aki Salo on various sprint         and hurdles related projects since 1998.
All this time, he has been able         to uniquely explain         biomechanics and research issues with very applied and understandable         way to help my coaching         processes.
For example, in the early 2000's, Dr Salo's work revealed how         hurdle take-off distance         is dependent on running velocity, which helped me to implement changes         to my athletes' running         technique.
I am still using the same principles with my current athletes         who include, for example,         Lawrence Clark (4th at the London Olympics 2012 in 110 m hurdles) and         Andrew Pozzi (4th at the         2012 World Indoor Championships in 60 m hurdles)."
[18].
Further,       based on the research in paper       5, Dr Salo and UK Athletics have analysed critical step length and step       frequency values from all       100 m finalists in the UK Championships since 2005 to inform coaches on       their athletes' technique       [15].
Consequently, this work has reached all 80 male and female finalists       and their coaches in the       current REF cycle.
Stimulated practitioner debate and wider dissemination: Dr Salo's       work has also found wider       national and international non-science audience &#8212; for example, paper 5 was       specifically discussed       in American coaching web-sites and blogs in spring 2011 [19].
His applied       research work with UK       Athletics (based on papers 1, 3, 4 &amp; 5) has been featured in the       Universities UK reports on "the       Impact of Universities" and "The Impact of University Research and Sports       Development" as well       as in mass media including international news agencies, newspapers and       national TV in 2012 [20].
This work also received governing body endorsement with an honourable       mention from the       European Athletics Association [14].
Influence on policy: Dr Salo's work at the Berlin World       Championships in 2009 forced the       International Association of Athletics Federations to clarify and modify       their relay running rules (the         definition of the exact starting point of the baton exchange) in the       following autumn [15].
Changed practice and influence on professional standards: The       impact and benefit of Dr       Salo's research is not limited only to athletics sprinting.
Based on       research knowledge and findings       on sprint start and sprinting (papers 3-5), UK Sport and British Bob       Skeleton contracted the       University of Bath to translate his expertise to the bob skeleton start in       2012-2014 [21].
This       demonstrates that Dr Salo's research can be transferred to and have an       impact across other sports       and this project is the first of its kind for bob skeleton.
The Head of       Research and Innovation at UK       Sport acknowledged: "Bob Skeleton has recently been one of the most         successful winter sports for         Team GB.
In order to keep ahead of our competitors, UK Sport and British         Bob Skeleton decided         to start a specific bob skeleton start project in 2011.
Based on Dr         Salo's research expertise in         athletics sprint start and generally in sprinting, it made him a natural         choice to lead this project and         translate his knowledge to other sports which has not utilised applied         sport science to its full         potential."
