     ADNAT supports the UK government's recommendations for tailored education       based on needs assessment as part of its recently introduced `Best       Practice Tariff' strategy (DoH (2011) Payment by Results Guidance for         2011-12.
London: DoH) and integration of technology into clinical       practice (DoH (2010) Delivering 21st Century IT Support for the NHS.
National Strategic Programme.
London: DoH).
ADNAT has been included in the       2013-2018 National Paediatric Service Improvement Delivery Plan (NHS       Diabetes.
(2013) National Paediatric Diabetes Service Improvement Plan       2013-2018.
London: DoH) following uptake by the NHS Paediatric Team.
In       their letter of support they state,     "ADNAT provides an opportunity to improve care in this highly         specialised field.... We are therefore happy to work with you and your         team to take ADNAT forward within the clinical field and to further its         research."
This Team also includes the UK Project Manager for the international       SWEET Project EU (www.sweet-project.eu)       which is working to develop EU centres of reference for paediatric       diabetes for which ADNAT has been recognised as having potential for       future EU dissemination (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pedi.2012.13.issue-s16/issuetoc).
ADNAT is also being discussed as a tool to provide data for the National         Paediatric Diabetes Audit, with an invitation to present at the       Royal College of Paediatric and Child Health in London in November 2013       (see email re: National Paediatric Diabetes Audit).
For researchers, ADNAT can provide both quantitative and qualitative       information regarding adolescent diabetes self-care needs.
This is an       important outcome as evidence suggests that the relationship between       educational outcomes and processes can provide an understanding of how       interventions should be targeted.
The ADNAT study is registered with the National Institute for Health       Research (NIHR) Cheshire, Merseyside and North Wales Medicines for       Children's Research (CMNWMCRN) Network Trials Unit (StudyID=6633),       and co-adopted by the Diabetes Research Network.
In a letter of support,       they wrote:     "...ADNAT has been one of the most successful studies within the MCRN         portfolio with respect to both recruiting participants on time and the         integration with research network resources'"     As a result of this success, Professor Cooper successfully applied for a       2-day secondment to the CMNWMCRN, and funding to support the study's       research associate.
The CMNWMCRN funded research nurses are also       supporting the delivery of the evaluation study in four hospitals,       including service support activities, monitoring and recruitment.
Other beneficiaries include lay volunteers who participated in the       study's Research Steering Group (n=16, 2005-2012).
This group, which       comprised 50% lay people including adolescents with T1D and their parents,       ensured that the research was focused by sharing understanding of youth       culture, identification of priorities, use of suitable research tools, and       disseminated locally through peer dialogue.
Findings have been disseminated nationally and internationally at both       professional and academic conferences and have included ten personal       invitations including one to present at the International Diabetes       Federation's World Diabetes Congress in Dubai, 2011, and three key-note       lectures to National (2012) and Regional Paediatric Diabetes Professional       Network (www.diabetes.nhs.uk/networks/paediatric_network)       Meetings (South East of England, 2012, North West, 2012, and Yorkshire and       Humber, North East and North Cumbria, 2013).
Other presentations include       Diabetes UK's Annual Professional Conference (2010, 2011, 2013), British       Sociological Association Medical Sociology Annual Conference (2008, 2011),       International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes, USA (2011),       Diabetes UK Major Supporter's Events (2011, 2011), NIHR Medicines for       Children's Research Network Annual Conference (2010, 2011), NIHR Diabetes       Research Network meeting (2010), Royal College of Nursing International       Research Conference (2008, 2010), and the Royal College of Paediatrics and       Child Health (2013).
Research work in both adult and paediatric diabetes has led to       invitations to contribute to a number of national expert groups, as       summarised in Table 1 below.
