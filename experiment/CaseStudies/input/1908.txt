     The following are examples of impact derived from research in Molecular         Ecology and Conservation at the University of Salford:             Continuing: The Stock           Identification Methods Working Group influences the EU Common         Fisheries Policy, focusing on minimising mismatches between true         biological stocks and traditionally perceived management areas and the         formulation of improved approaches to defining stock units and the         promotion of evidence-based management approaches.
As a result of         research by Mariani et al, management advice was devised for several         species, including Atlantic herring, plaice, black scabbardfish, and         oceanic redfish.
2012: Irish fish, Irish people: roles and responsibilities           for an emptying ocean: Responsible policy decisions and effective         enforcement are necessary to improve the sustainability of the Irish         fishing industry.
A major socio-political impact of the detection of         species substitution in the seafood market resulted in the establishment         by the Irish government of a "Food Fraud Task Force" in 2012, to         oversee trade operations in the food sector.
The aim of the task force         is to act as a communications, co-ordination and networking group, where         intelligence and research can be further developed and shared.
2012-onwards: LABELFISH         is a network of laboratories and national bodies developing a common         strategy and harmonised techniques to control the genetic traceability         and labeling of seafood products sold on the Atlantic and a Europe-wide         standardised approach to identifying and authenticating the major fish         products traded in the EU.
The UK government, through DEFRA, is         co-funding this project and working with Mariani to ensure that the         deliverables have maximum benefit to all stakeholders, including         consumers, retailers, food processors and fishermen.
[a]        A key element of deriving impact from research into fish mislabelling         is public engagement.
Mariani's seafood mislabelling studies have been         covered by The             Guardian, prompting 129 comments and debate among the         public, The             Independent, The             Telegraph and El Pais.
The BBC series Fake             Britain, Newsround         and the Channel 4 documentaries Dispatches         and Food             Unwrapped commissioned Mariani to provide advice on matters         of genetic identification, seafood traceability and fisheries         sustainability.
Public engagement has raised awareness about the         environmental implications of seafood substitution.
Mariani has also         successfully engaged food processing organisations and fishing lobby         groups including SEAFISH whose         purpose is to secure a sustainable and profitable future for the UK         seafood industry, which has promoted           Mariani's research.
2012-2013: Contribution to the Manchester           Science Festival raised awareness about the diversity of fish         species and their sustainability as food sources.
A blind taste test of         people attending a Manchester Science Festival event at the University         of Salford found that only 15% could identify cod served up from a fish         and chip van.
2013: The Pelagic           Freezer-Trawler Association (PFA) has commissioned Mariani to         genetically screen fishery samples of horse mackerel (Trachurus           trachurus) and provide an independent assessment on their degree         of similarity.
PFA represents the interests of 9 European pelagic         freezer-trawler companies.
The association has members in the UK,         Ireland, France, Germany, Lithuania and the Netherlands, operating         freezer-trawlers that process pelagic fish for human consumption.
[b]         2011-onwards: Research undertaken by Mariani in landscape         genetics and phylogeography of mountain caribou led to the re-definition         of conservation units by the Committee on the Status of Endangered         Wildlife in Canada, influencing exploitation of natural resources (oil,         gas, timber) in Alberta and British Columbia and leading to further         funded research in collaboration with the University of Calgary.
[c]        Jehle is the co-author of the IUCN           Red List of Threatened Species&#8482; assessment of 8 amphibian species         of major conservation importance (Lissotriton boscai, L. helveticus,           L. vulgaris, Triturus carnifex, T. dobrogicus, T. marmoratus, T.           pygmaeus, T. cristatus).
The IUCN Red List is committed to         providing objective, scientific information on globally threatened         biodiversity, providing the foundation for informed decisions about         conservation from local to global levels.
The List provides taxonomic,         conservation status and distribution information on plants and animals         that have been globally evaluated using the IUCN           Red List Categories and Criteria, designed to determine the         relative risk of extinction (i.e.
those listed as Critically Endangered,         Endangered and Vulnerable).
[d]         2013: Nativeness of great crested newts in the Scottish           Highlands: Jehle's advice has supported the conservation         management of UK amphibians, in particular the crested newt.
The crested         newt has declined in Europe, is very rare in Scotland and the rarest of         three newt species native to Britain.
Those which live in the Scottish         Highlands, are separated by more than 80 km of unfavourable habitat from         the main habitat in Central Scotland, so most assumed that they were         introduced into the Highlands.
Scottish           Natural Heritage (SNH) commissioned Jehle to use DNA         fingerprinting to discover if great crested newts are native to the         Scottish Highlands.
Jehle et al compared the DNA of eight populations         from the Highlands with two reference populations from the northern         limits of their more continuous distribution in Central Scotland and         showed that great crested newts are almost certainly native to the         region and Highland newts are genetically distinct from those in central         Scotland.
SNH intends to devise new strategies, the creation of new         ponds and the regulation of translocation schemes.
David O'Brien of SNH         said: "A number of us suspected the great crested newts were native           to the Highlands, and we're thrilled to find that this hunch was           right.
It's important to know the newts' origins, as they're rare and           protected nationally and internationally.
This research gives even           more reason to conserve the small, unique populations of great crested           newts in the Highlands."
[12,e]         2011, 2013-onwards: Jehle et al were commissioned by Natural         England in 2013 to Great Crested Newts and their use of the Farmed           Landscape in England.
[13]         2013: Jehle was commissioned by a A           One + Area 7 to investigate the genetic impacts of a large-scale         newt translocation due to construction work along the A6 in Derbyshire         contracted by the Highways Agency.
Jehle demonstrated that translocated populations are genetically healthy         but have survived in isolation, initiating the implementation of         measures towards improving habitat modifications to increase         connectivity.
[14]        Jehle's involvement in the Council of the Tropical           Biology Association influences the remits and targets of this         prestigious organisation, which is the primary NGO for conservation         capacity building in Africa.
The University of Salford is one of the few         UK members (alongside Cambridge, St Andrews, Edinburgh, Liverpool,         Leeds, Aberdeen, Nottingham, Belfast Universities).
