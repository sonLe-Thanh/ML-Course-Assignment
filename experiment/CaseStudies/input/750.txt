     Beyond the direct impact of his academic publications, Professor Bewley       Taylor has communicated his formulation of the increasing tensions between       the prohibition-oriented UN drug control conventions and national policies       through his place on NGO delegations to CND between 2003 and 2013 and       associated off-the-record briefings with a range of policy actors       (national and NGO delegations, EC officials and UN secretariat).
He has       also presented his research findings, conclusions and policy       recommendations at government and NGO sponsored satellite events at the UN       in Vienna (2011, 2012 and 2013).
These Chatham House rules events       attracted a diverse and sizable audience (50+), including UN secretariat       as well as diplomats and NGO delegates many of whom have provided impact       testimonials listed below.
Bewley Taylor also achieved significant secondary reach through       collaboration with the Netherlands based non-governmental organisation,       the Transnational Institute (TNI; http://www.tni.org/work-area/drugs-and-democracy)       and its Drugs and Democracy Programme director, Dr Martin Jelsma in a       series of grey literature reports.
These include The UN drug control         conventions: The Limits of Latitude, www.tni.org/sites/www.tni.org/files/download/dlr18.pdf       (March 2012, Spanish version: www.undrugcontrol.info/images/stories/documents/dlr18s.pdf),       which outlines the policy-space nation states possess while operating       within the confines of the extant treaty framework and classifies all       policy options as either conforming, challenging or contradictory to the       UN conventions.
The reports have been widely disseminated via NGO cascade       news alerts reaching civil society, government and International       Organization end users numbering in the thousands and are referred to by       policy makers.
Indeed, the Spanish version of the Limits of Latitude       brief was used as a key document during private discussions within the       Bolivian government when considering moves to revise its position relative       to the UN drug control treaties.
Further evidence of reach can be seen through citations to both this       report and `Challenging the UN drug control conventions: problems and       possibilities' article (R6) within the Organization of American States'       recent study on drug policy reform Scenarios for the Drug Policy in         the Americas: 2013-2025 (http://www.oas.org/documents/eng/press/Scenarios_Report.PDF).
This is the first inter- governmental report to discuss international drug       policy reform and Bewley-Taylor was an invited speaker at a high-level       round-table event discussing the report's findings at Chatham House in       July 2013.
This took place within the context of the High Level Segment       (HLS) of the CND in 2014 and the United Nations General Assembly Special       Session on Drugs (UNGASS) in 2016.
Ernesto Samper Pizano, President of       Colombia (1994-1998), has played an important role opening up the drug       policy debate within Latin America and it is of note that Bewley-Taylor's       research is also cited within Samper's recent book on the issue, Drogas         Drigas: Prohibici&#243;n o Legalizaci&#243;n. Una nueva propuesta (Debate       Books, 2013)     Within the UK, Bewley-Taylor is the expert advisor on international drug       policy to the All Party Parliamentary Group on Drug Policy Reform (APPG),       and participated in a key meeting of national drug `czars' and ambassadors       at the House of Lords in November 2011 to discuss possible alternatives to       the current system of UN drug control.
His ideas on the formation of `Like       Minded Groups' is currently being applied in work with the APPG on the       development of a group of European states to support drug policy reform in       Latin America in the lead up to the HLS and UNGASS.
Bewley-Taylor also       presented research at an Expert Seminar Organized by the Czech Government,       TNI and the NGO the International Drug Policy Consortium (IDPC http://idpc.net/),       on drug policy reform in Prague in February 2012 to discuss possible       routes for treaty reform.
Elite drug policy makers who have heard his presentations, been briefed       by, worked with and/or read Bewley-Taylor's research testify to the       significance of his impact on their work.
Indeed, as the following       testimonies demonstrate, while not claiming direct responsibility for       specific policy shifts, which result from highly complex processes of       change, his research can be seen to have had an impact in stimulating       debate among national, UN and European Union drug policy officials and       national ambassadors considering changes in policy or withdrawal of       existing policy.
- Former Head of the Drugs Policy Coordination Unit of the           European Commission, `I have found Bewley-Taylor's work on         the historical background, functioning, and future of the UN drug         control system extremely valuable for contextualizing the geopolitical         forces at play within what is a complex and fluid issue area.
His         accurate and realistic analysis of `narco-diplomacy' in general, but         particularly in relation to the role of the United States and parts of         the UN drug control apparatus, helps provide the clarity necessary for         decision-making within a multi-dimensional policy environment such as         the Commission.'
- Member, Global Commission on Drug Policy, Geneva, Former         President of Switzerland and Minister of Home Affairs: `A       growing number of States Parties to the UN conventions are moving away       from a punitive approach to drug use, confronted with the public health       and the security challenges (or consequences) of the policy followed for       decades.
Bewley-Taylor's ideas on `soft defection' from the control regime       and `regime weakening' provide a useful conceptual lens through which to       consider a global system more able to accommodate the complex and specific       needs of individual nation states.'
- Former Mexican Attorney General), former Ambassador of           Mexico to the UK, and Ambassador of Mexico to the US), Washington, DC,           USA: `Recent years have seen the regulatory regime of drugs         come under increasing scrutiny... Bewley-Taylor's research offers an         innovative scientific framework for understanding how the resulting         policy shifts impact the global control system and constitutes a         must-read for anyone interested or engaged in the drug policy debate.
It         is timely work that has practical application in the Americas and         beyond'.
- Former UK First Secretary, Permanent Mission to the           United Nations, Vienna and currently UNAIDS (senior expert adviser           Most At Risk Populations), Geneva: `As a member of the UK         delegation to the CND between 2003 and 2011 I found Bewley-Taylor's         research on the international drug control system, particularly his         ideas around regime change and developing tensions within the UN         framework, to be very useful for my work.
He has done much to reframe         the way `practitioners' within the policy community view the UN         environment, including the role of treaty bodies, both in terms of         broader historical context and future policy options.'
- Former UK Deputy Drug Czar and Head of Demand Reduction,           United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, current Chair of the IDPC           and advisor to the Global Commission on Drug Policy, London:         'From the perspective of someone involved in national and international         drug policy debates over many years, I can say that Bewley-Taylor's         research has done much to promote reconsideration of law enforcement         dominated policies dealing with the illicit drugs market.
Many of his         publications have stimulated new thinking and reframed debates amongst         analysts and decision makers.
He has consequently played an important         role in helping to change the "mood music" of the drug policy debate,         both at national and international levels, and provided useful         conceptual frameworks for the consideration of alternative human rights         and public health based policy approaches'.
