Development of carbon credit certification schemes     Pathway: The research-led advice of Patenaude on societal and       commercial aspects of forestry carbon emissions has been regularly       solicited by think-tanks, NGOs and certification bodies.
Patenaude was       asked by the Gold Standard Foundation (GSF) to provide advice on the       potential extension of the GSF certification scheme into forest,       agriculture and land-use carbon, which occurred in September 2012 through       acquisition of the CarbonFix standard, The underpinning role of       Patenaude's research-led advice in this decision is corroborated in a       letter from the CEO of the GSF [A].
Patenaude also led the       technical panel of the Natural Forest Standard (NFS), developed by       Ecometrica Ltd (May 2012) as a voluntary carbon standard integrating       social, biodiversity and carbon values for REDD Natural Forest projects [B].
Significance and reach:            The GSF manages a premium quality carbon offset certification         programme and is the largest international certification standard for         carbon mitigation projects (mobilizing c. &#8364;500million).
The         forest, agriculture and land-use certification scheme now includes 9         validated / pre-validated projects worldwide, benefiting 8,695 people         and representing 20,042 ha of project land [C].
The NFS standard is used by two projects in Brazil (Trocano Araretama,         area 1,346,541 ha.
and Madeirinhas, area 493,953 ha.)
to avoid         deforestation and forest degradation [D].
Enhanced cross-sector collaboration on financial risks from         forest-loss     Pathway: Patenaude has been invited on three occasions to       contribute to the Z/YEN Ltd commercial think-tank events 2010 - 2011.
These invitations were underpinned by the research work and are       corroborated in a letter from the Director of Z/YEN [E].
Building       on these networking activities.
In 2011 Patenaude established the       cross-sector Forest Finance Risk Network (FFRN, http://tinyurl.com/B7-3-S4-1,       funded by the NERC award listed in Section 3), aimed at providing       knowledge exchange between researchers and end-users, to generate a stable       investment environment for forestry.
In 2012, a research-led spin-out       company providing consultancy and project/data management services related       to remote sensing of forest resources, Carbomap Ltd. (http://www.carbomap.com)       was founded with Woodhouse as CEO and Patenaude as Director.
Significance and reach:            The three Z/YEN events at which Patenaude presented were: "Finance,         Water &amp; Forestry: Where's The Data?
Symposium" (July 2010); "Finance         and Forestry Roundtable on Finance And Forestry: Where's The Data?"
(September 2010); and as key speaker at the "Finance, Biodiversity and         Managed Ecosystems: Where's The Data?"
(Spring 2011).
In each case the         audience was 200+ participants, drawn from representatives of financial         institutions, carbon market consultancies, investors, NGOs, and emission         traders [F].
In the year from August 2011 membership of the FFRN grew from 8 to         over 80 global carbon-related organisations, including NGOs, insurers         and investors (e.g., WWF, WillisRE, VCS, ForestRe, Acclimatise).
The         following members can corroborate specific benefits derived from the         network (all of which occurred 2011 &#8212; June 2013).
The Director of         EnviroMarket Ltd can corroborate the development of "Two forest           bonds and an early stage development of data service for investors are           products that emerged as a result of the Network led by Patenaude"         [G].
The Director of ForestRe Ltd stated: "Really excellent           work.
Extremely useful for us as a risk modelling unit for insurance           sector &#8212; we have to price risk in a few hours for most forest clients.
The network has helped us develop growth models, wind damage functions           and the planning and design of baseline situations" [H].
The Head of Economics and Climate Change at the Forestry Commission         Scotland stated: "The knowledge exchange improves our knowledge of           how risks will be estimated for the woodland carbon code [...], and           how our buffer estimates will be therefore amended" [I].
Carbomap Ltd is a rapidly developing business that has already been         identified as `important' in a February 2012 article by NGO Responding           to Climate Change and been the recipient of a SMART Feasibility         Award (January 2013) from Scottish Enterprise [J].
