     Beneficiaries of the research are:            Decision-makers and stakeholders in communication support in the legal         sector(e.g.
senior members of Judiciary)       Police trainers (e.g.
Scottish Police College staff)       Police Institutional users of interpreting at national and         international levels (e.g.
Police Forces)       Organisations providing communication support (e.g.
Happy to           Translate)       Knowledge exchange bodies in Policing (e.g.
Scottish Institute for         Policing Research, SIPR)       Professional bodies for legal interpreters (e.g.
EULITA)          Police investigative communications involving interpreters have been       enhanced through the work of CTISS.
Researchers delivered training for all       new police officers "to the scale of hundreds of officers each year"       (Section 5, Source 2,) on `The Role of the Interpreter' (Initial Detective       Training Course, Interview Advisors Course, 2004-2009, Perez, Wilson) at       the Scottish Police College.
This participation resulted in "significant         steps that have been made in professionalisation" (Source 2).
A Code       of Practice on How to Work with Interpreters was developed in 2007       as part of the training delivered and continues to be an integral part of       the training material used.
CTISS input to the Hostage-Crisis Negotiation       Course, (B&#246;ser, Perez, Wilson, 2013) has been described as an instance of       "knowledge transfer from your profession to the operational policing         environment that will no doubt be instrumental in saving life"       (Source 1).
Source 2 summarises the impact of CTISS training: "the         Police Scotland standard operating procedure, implemented following the         recent inception of the new force, reflects the learning derived from         the provision made by the department at Heriot-Watt."
B&#246;ser and       Wilson's DVD on Best Practice in Police Interpreting, one of a set of six       films produced for the ImPLI project and available on YouTube "has been         suggested as worthy of consideration as a potential training tool in         future police and criminal justice partner training" by Police       Scotland (Source 8).
A decision about this is imminent at the time of       writing.
In 2010 Perez and Wilson contributed to a training video for       members of Happy to Translate, an innovative scheme promoting       equal access by overcoming language barriers between public organisations       and service users.
The impact of this "training material extends across         a wide range of professional sectors" (Source 6) such as the Crown       Office Procurator Fiscal Service, Scottish Criminal Cases Review       Commission, the Scottish Refugee Council.
Since 2010 training has been provided on an on-going basis as CPD       provision to other professional groups, in particular trainee advocates,       and researchers are consulted on an on-going basis by the group advising       the Crown Office Prosecution Service and Court Service (Working Group on       Interpreting and Translation/Legal Services (WGIT) on the monitoring of       interpreting in court.
As noted by source 3: "Languages and         Intercultural Studies (LINCS) has collaborated with a variety of legal         professionals over the past ten years, influencing developments relating         to interpreting in the legal field."
Dissemination through the ImPLI       Project supported the implementation of EU Directive 2010/64 and enabled       the research outcomes to be adopted by forces in Italy, Germany, France,       Belgium and the Czech Republic.
Findings from the research were       disseminated to linguistic and legal experts at a final conference in       Paris (2012) with endorsement from Viviane Reding, Vice-President of the       European Commission (see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSmHwLSgfrk).
At the request of Scottish police staff and stakeholders a dissemination       event for ImPLI findings was held at Heriot-Watt in 2013.
Source 4       comments on ImPLI: "The outputs of the research are excellent tools for         the training of police officers as well as interpreters", and       attests that ImPLI contributes to "the improvement in the quality of         interpreting services and in effective interpreter-supported         communication".
The follow-up project Co-Minor-In/Quest (B&#246;ser and       Wilson, January 2013) on interpreter- mediated investigative questioning       of minors builds on the insight and the infrastructure of impact       generation established in the course of the ImPLI project.
Co-operation with police forces generated a body of experimental       audiovisual data on interpreted witness interviews.
Findings from this       data were tested in discussion during two seminars (B&#246;ser 2011, German       Police University College, M&#252;nster, B&#246;ser 2012 Ljubljana University) for       European graduates of the FBI Training Academy in Quantico and FBI agents       in Europe.
Source 5 was instrumental in the sharing of this "research         work with colleagues in foreign jurisdictions....
The discussion ... has         generated new ways of thinking about police investigations in a         multilingual setting... .
It is clear to me that this research work         helps to shape policy and practice in this country and internationally."
In recognition of the significance of this work for policing practice, the       Scottish Police have released an unique data set of interpreted suspect       interviews.
This provides the basis for further research which will lead       to evidence-based recommendations for practice     In June 2014 Perez contributed to the creation of a research programme       for the FBI's High Value Detainee Interrogation Group to advance       interviewing practices which laid the foundation for further impact       generation at international level.
The work has advanced the professionalisation of legal interpreting, in       particular through the establishment of an association and EU-wide       register of legal interpreters and translators.
Arising from an EU funded       project with CTISS (Perez and Wilson) as one of three academic partners,       EULITA (European Legal Interpreters and Translators Association) was       launched in November 2009.
An association of legal interpreters and       translators EULITA also holds the EU-wide register of qualified legal       interpreters and translators and promotes co-operation between       practitioners and researchers (see Source 6).
The EULITA website is now       the prime EU repository for all information on legal interpreting and       translation.
EULITA has gone on to lead projects such as TRAFUT on the       training of legal interpreters and translators.
This project also       addressed a number of impediments to the transposition of EU Directive       2010.
Source 3 notes that following participation in the TRAFUT project,       further progress in Scotland will be supported by facilitating the "observing         of interpreter-mediated trials with a view to assessing, and hopefully         remedying quality issues to ensure compliance with the European         Directive and equal access to justice".
In recognition of her work       with EULITA Wilson was invited to join a team of experts that developed       the national professional standards which underpin the development of       vocational qualifications in interpreting.
Recently, appropriate procurement procedures have been identified as a       crucial element in the down-stream assurance of quality in police       interpreting provision.
An evaluation tool has been developed (Perez and       Wilson, 2010, 2012) to assess the translation/interpretation quality of       samples provided by agencies submitting bids for a Translation and       Interpreting services procurement contract with Lothian and Borders and       Strathclyde Police.
This tool assesses "the capabilities of bidders to         comply with the service requirements within the tender for provision of         interpreter and translation services".
Source 8 adds that "the       service as a whole will undoubtedly benefit from the results and findings       of this piece of work upon progressive migration to national service       provision."
The recognition of the TICS report as a reference point is evident in the       various ways in which it has informed policy discussions and decisions:       the report was at the core of the Lost in Translation seminar,       jointly organised in March 2006 by Consumer Focus Scotland, NRCEMH and NHS       Health Scotland.
Subsequently the TICS report authors were asked to       contribute to the consultation process for the design of TICS standards       for the NHS (2011).
In 2010 Perez contributed to an analysis of the       European status quo in the field of PSI.
The resulting report was endorsed       as a benchmark document for policy in the field of multilingualism by the       Commissioner for Multilingualism and DG Translation and DG Interpreting.
