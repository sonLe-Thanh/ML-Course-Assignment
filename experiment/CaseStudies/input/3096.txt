Context     Many authorities have questioned the routine use of antibiotics for       endocarditis prophylaxis,       arguing that the adverse effects of antibiotics may outweigh the potential       benefits [2] (S3).
The       over prescription of antibiotics by the whole medical and veterinary       professions has resulted in the       emergence of resistance of many organisms to the traditional therapeutic       antibiotics available.
Such antibiotic-resistant bacteria pose a real threat to global health,       and England's Chief Medical       Officer has called for urgent action to address the overuse of       antibiotics.
The Department of       Health launched a five-year action plan in 2013 to try to address the       issue of antibiotic resistance       and ensure that they are only prescribed where truly needed.
This builds       on their original 2000       strategy.
Pathway to impact     The Cochrane review sparked much international debate (S2-4) around the       prescribing of antibiotic       prophylaxis for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis, with some       dentists unwilling to change       practice, concerned about the possibly of putting their patients at risk.
Following the publication of       the NICE guidance (2008) (S1), in which the initial review [1] was used as       the highest level of       evidence (S3), the findings of the review were able to have a significant       impact which resulted in a       dramatic reduction of antibiotic prophylaxis for bacterial endocarditis.
Two authors on the review       (Oliver and Roberts) were members of the guidance development group       in the development of the       NICE guidelines.
The 2008 review update [2] was produced along side the       NICE guidance (S3)       and the Cochrane Oral Health Group were stakeholders in the development of       this guidance.
Additionally, the review was used to inform other international       guidelines, including the American       Heart Association (2007) and the British Society for Antimicrobial       Chemotherapy 2006) (S5-9).
Within the UK, NICE recommendations were to stop routinely prescribing       antibiotic prophylaxis for       patients at risk of bacterial endocarditis undergoing dental and a wide       range of other invasive       procedures.
An update review was undertaken to reflect emerging evidence;       no amendments to       the initial conclusions were made.
Reach and significance of impact            The NICE guidelines which utilised the Cochrane review have         dramatically changed         practice as can be seen in the 78.6% drop in prescribing rates for         antibiotic prophylaxis in         England (Figure 1) (S 7).
There has been no evidence of a large increase         in the incidence         of cases of, nor deaths from, infective endocarditis in the two years         after the guideline.
Patients in the UK no longer routinely receive antibiotic prophylaxis         for endocarditis.
Resistance to antibiotics is one of the greatest threats to public         health.
The unnecessary         prescribing of antibiotics can lead to increased resistance, which is of         concern to the         general population as a whole, not just those at risk of bacterial         endocarditis.
Since 2008 there has been a reduction, on average, of 8,000         prescriptions of antibiotic         prophylaxis per month in England alone, resulting in a significant cost         saving of up to         &#163;219,000 per year (S10).
The range of potential side effects from the administration of         antibiotics is vast, largely with         a hypersensitive aetiology but some direct toxic effects may also occur.
All four types of         hypersensitivity reaction have been reported with the use of penicillins         including the most         severe reaction, anaphylactic shock, and other type I reactions         including allergic bronchial         obstruction, allergic rhinitis and angio-oedema; haemolytic anaemia,         type II, has been         recorded; drug fever, a type III reaction and the delayed type         hypersensitivity (type IV) of         allergic dermatitis.
Reduction in use of antibiotics per se         reduces the risk of such adverse         reactions amongst patients.
The review has additionally been used to inform international guidance         in the U.S.A.,         Europe and Asia Pacific (S7-9).
