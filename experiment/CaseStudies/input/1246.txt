     Context for impact     The impacts arise because the research is topical, having direct       relevance to professional and public behaviour and to commercial interest.
For example, one quarter of adults (26%) with natural teeth in England and       Wales use a powered toothbrush, the UK toothbrush market is valued at &#163;201       million and powered brushes account for almost half of this market.
These       patterns will be replicated in many other countries.
The impact of our research falls into three categories: on public health       policy, on commerce and on society.
Impact on national public health policy     The research has been incorporated into national clinical and public       health guidelines across England and Wales.
Dental teams may now recommend       powered rotation oscillation toothbrushes with confidence.
Their use is       incorporated into the guidance of the Department of Health / British       Association for the Study of Community Dentistry toolkit for dental       prevention Delivering Better Oral Health (S1).
This document forms       Department of Health policy on preventive dentistry in England and is       implemented almost universally across the NHS.
In this way, policy       underpinned by Sheffield has been sent to all 23,000 NHS dentists in       England and Wales.
Delivering Better Oral Health is named in       nearly all local NHS prevention strategies and has been used as a standard       in many criterion-based audits of NHS dentistry including those conducted       in Somerset, South and West England, Hounslow and Manchester (S2).
Moreover, Delivering Better Oral Health is used as part of the       currency of NHS dental contracts; it is cited as a standard to be adhered       to as part of those contracts.
It is also cited in the guidance on       commissioning the NHS dental pathway as an integrated model of service       delivery and as part of the rationale for the forthcoming contract (S3).
The review was also cited to support the use of powered toothbrushes in       the Royal College of Surgeons guidelines for the oral management of       oncology patients (S4) and four other standard nursing and dermatology       texts (See S5 for an example).
Commercial impact     The Cochrane Reviews were used extensively by Procter and Gamble       (P&amp;G) in their global marketing strategy to gain competitive       advantage.
P&amp;G used the reviews in their worldwide dental professional       engagement because of their high quality and independence.
Their       professional engagement takes the form detail aids supplied to practices       and in scientific exchange lectures given at dental schools and by key       thought leaders (S6).
P&amp;G train their representatives extensively on       the importance and relevance of the Cochrane Power Reviews.
The P&amp;G Director of Global Professional and Scientific Relations has       testified:     "Following the first Cochrane systematic review on Power versus manual         tooth brushing, published in 2003, we used this information to convince         dental professionals of the validity of our data as it had been         independently and systematically reviewed.
The subsequent Cochrane         updates have led to a change in attitude regarding recommending power         toothbrushes with an oscillating/rotating action.
P&amp;G has used the         results of the Cochrane studies in more than twenty countries worldwide         in dental professional advertising, as detail aids supplied to practices         and in scientific exchange lectures provided at dental schools and by         key thought leaders.
We train our representatives extensively on the         importance and relevance of the Cochrane Power Reviews.
"The consumer media in North America have used data from the Cochrane         Collaboration to support endorsement of oscillating/rotating power         toothbrushes, notably on CNN, NBC, Fox News and through Consumer         Reports.
These direct to consumer communications drive conversations         between practitioners and their patients and lead to more specific         product recommendations for oscillating/rotating power toothbrushes.
"While it is impossible to quantify the value of the Cochrane Review         in terms of yearly product sales, it can be shared that the power         toothbrush business for P&amp;G is worth over 1 billion dollars in sales         worldwide and over 50% of consumer sales follow recommendation from a         dental professional" (S7).
Another company, Colgate, used the review ahead of the launch of their       new ProClinical electric toothbrush to position it in the market.
The       product was the company's first entry in the powered rechargeable       toothbrush category.
The launch of the toothbrush was accompanied by a       strong marketing campaign, which was informed by our research.
ProClinical's share of the electric toothbrush market reached 7% just       three months after launch (S8, S9).
Impacts on society     Impacts on society arise from critical reviews in the media.
Commentaries       on the first reviews received front page coverage in The Washington         Post, New York Times, The Observer and Daily         Mail (2005, outside the reference period for REF2014).
The debate       has continued with each update of the reviews being discussed in, for       example, Which?
Which?
Conversation, Choice (The       Australian version of Which?
), The Daily Mail, The Gadget Show       and in numerous other consumer publications etc.
(S10).
In this way the       reviews have informed better consumer choice for oral hygiene.
