     Reid's research on Eritrea and the Horn of Africa has had a significant       influence on UK foreign       policy and on international organisations such as the World Bank.
His work       has been cited in       House of Commons reports used for briefing parliamentarians (1, below) and       in World Bank       reports (2).
Reid has had extended and direct collaboration with Chatham       House, and Sally Healy,       formerly an Associate Fellow there, has spoken very positively of his       contribution, particularly its       Horn of Africa Project, intended to deepen policy-makers understanding of       the region and its       political context.
She writes:     "Richard's first-hand experience of Eritrea, and the network of         Eritrean scholars he introduced to         Chatham House, helped to bring a balance and depth to discussion about         the region and its wars         that is often lacking.
In these discussions Richard himself brought         historical depth to contemporary         political debates, helping the Chatham House policy audiences to         understand the "back story" and         to contextualise Eritrea's apparent belligerence.
I see this as a very         helpful antidote to the         personalisation of politics and the banality of good guy vs. bad guy         analysis."
(3)     The impacts of Reid's research that are most frequently and deeply felt,       however, relate to their       significance to human rights advocacy and refugee decision support.
His       thorough-going unveiling       of the historical roots of and justifications for the styles of power,       militarism, distrust and intolerance       that engender human rights abuses in Eritrea and the Horn of Africa have       proved crucial to the       work of Human Rights Watch, which endeavours to militate against human       rights abuses in Eritrea.
Ben Rawlence, Senior Researcher, Africa Division at Human Rights Watch,       has lauded Reid's       immovable adherence to his views, unswayed by the exigencies of       short-termist government       policies: "He is also the only one [academic working on Eritrea] who's       [sic] public work is       undifferentiated from his private beliefs and private consultancy work:       therefore, independent and       reliable."
(5) More than this, Reid's publications and particularly his       book Eritrea's External         Relations of 2009 &#8212; the only book that treats the subject &#8212; has       significantly informed the       strategic approach of Human Rights Watch in the Horn of Africa:     "His work on Eritrea's foreign policy has been particularly useful as         we have tried to influence the         government there and other governments on how to approach the country.
The overall background         analysis of the Tigray conflict as the driver of current human rights         problems in both Eritrea,         Ethiopia and to the extent both countries have been intervening in         Somalia is central to HRW's         understanding and to our strategic approach to the region."
(5, 6,       7)     Perhaps, the most potentially life-changing impacts of Reid's work are       evidenced in the inclusion of       his commended and widely-disseminated report Eritrea: The Siege State       of 2010 in the two most       important and trusted online global resources supporting refugee decision       support, RefWorld and       The European Country of Origin Information Network (ECOI.Net) (8, 9, 10).
Both resources are       freely available and used by immigration officials, lawyers and refugee       advocate organisations       throughout Europe, the Anglophone World and beyond.
Refworld is the       world's leading repository       of carefully selected reports and papers relating to the general       background, the legal contexts, and       the human rights and international protection considerations regarding       populations in the most       common source countries of refugees.
It is provided and vetted by the       United Nations Human       Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
Not only is Reid's work cited in many       of the documents       available on Refworld relating to the situation in Eritrea and that of       ethnic Eritreans in Ethiopia and       the region more broadly, including in the UNHCR's own Guidelines for         Assessing International         Protection Needs of Asylum Seekers from Eritrea (8), Reid's       anonymously written Eritrea: The         Siege State of 2009 appears in full.
It is also featured as one of       27 reports available on ECOI.Net,       a resource, managed by the Austrian Centre for Country of Origin and       Asylum Research and       Documentation, a division of the Austrian Red Cross (10).
Given the       numbers of Eritrean refugees       who have lodged asylum applications in the world's 44 industrial countries       since the publication of       Eritrea: the Siege State, which total according to the UNHCR 8,521       in 2010, 10,935 in 2011 and       4,831 in the first half of 2012, it can be assumed that Reid's research       has been called upon and       mobilised in potentially thousands of asylum cases.
