     Understanding the relationship between local people and wetlands       throughout Africa is a critical pre-requisite to the implementation of       effective wetland management strategies that sustain peoples' livelihood       needs alongside ecosystem services.
The applied nature of the research (in       terms of identifying lessons for sustainable wetland management) has meant       that it has been conducted in consultation and collaboration with a range       of end-use stakeholders, including local and international NGOs (see       below), who have subsequently incorporated the findings and lessons       learned into their own field projects.
The impact is threefold.
The       research has:            informed field project design and subsequent policy-making amongst         NGOs and government;       had a direct impact on the livelihoods of project beneficiaries, where         applied;       informed the broader wetlands-livelihoods policy agenda.
Three specific examples follow.
A. Community-based wetland management capacity building in Ethiopia     Dixon and Wetland Action have a long-standing collaborative relationship       with the Ethio-Wetlands and Natural Association (EWNRA).
The research on       local wetland management institutions was undertaken collaboratively with       EWNRA and the findings of this research subsequently informed a range of       successive field implementation projects (Sources 1-4).
In       particular, a core aim of the Wichi Integrated Wetland and Watershed       Natural Resources Management Project implemented in western Ethiopia (SIDA       funded, 2005 - 2008) was to empower community-based local institutions for       natural resource management (Sources 1, 2).
The research has had       considerable significance and reach.
In addition to direct livelihood       development and water security interventions that benefited over 2000       households in the area, over 50 local institution members were trained in       watershed-wetland management.
An impact study report from 2009 suggested       that people have experienced a significant improvement in livelihood       security and wetland environmental conditions since the start of the       project (Source 1).
Further collaborative analysis of the project       experiences (2011-2012) have recently been published in an Earthscan book       (Source 3).
B.
Striking a Balance     The Striking a Balance (SAB) project was funded by Wetlands International       and implemented by Wetland Action (with local partners) between 2006-2008       in Zambia and Malawi (Source 5).
The project sought to incorporate       many of the lessons and findings from the Ethiopian wetlands work relating       to local knowledge and community-based local institutions in seeking to       sustain the ecosystem and livelihood benefits from seasonal wetlands       through the implementation of a Functional Landscape Approach (FLA).
Key       research impacts here include the participatory development of wetland and       catchment conservation measures, and local institutional arrangements for       managing wetlands and catchments (Village Natural Resource Management       Committees).
The SAB final project report (2009: Source 6)       estimates that these have led to a significant reduction in poverty       (30-60% increase in crop yields from wetlands) among the 312 households       involved, a development which has been facilitated by the project's       investment in building social, institutional and natural capital at the       community level - a direct consequence of Wetland Action's long-term       research expertise in these areas.
A one year extension to the SAB project       in Malawi, which developed the FLA further, was funded by Wetlands       International (2009-2010) and continues to be promoted as part of their       Wetlands and Poverty Reduction Project (Sources 7, 8).
In an example of the cyclical nature of research-implementation linkages,       the SAB project itself has subsequently stimulated further academic       research; in 2012 Dr Dixon received funding to explore the legacy of the       SAB intervention and, in particular, the lessons learned from the local       institutional capacity building component of the project (Source 7).
C. Wetlands-Livelihoods Policy Agenda     There is evidence of an impact of this research on the wider wetlands       policy-making agenda.
For example:            In 2012, the 11th meeting of the Conference of the         Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of         International importance formally recognized the relevance of the GAWI         project in supporting the implementation of Resolution VIII.3.
This         urges contracting parties to acknowledge the need for appropriate         implementation of agricultural practices and policies that are         compatible with wetland conservation and sustainable use goals         (Resolution XI.15) (Source 9).
Both the Ramsar Handbook (2010) (http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/lib/hbk4-01.pdf)         and the Netherlands based NGO Wetlands International continue to cite         the SAB project as an example of how wetlands can contribute to poverty         reduction (Source 8).
The findings and field experiences of the SAB project have been         recognised as good practice in wetland-catchment management and are         being incorporated into the work of two consortia in Malawi funded by         DFID: the Enhancing Community Resilience Programme (ECRP) led by         Christian Aid and the Developing Innovative Solutions with Communities         to Overcome Vulnerability through Enhanced Resilience (DISCOVER) led by         Concern Universal.
In 2012, Dr Dixon provided consultancy services to         the latter, running a training workshop for field staff and providing an         assessment of the application of the SAB approach to field sites in         northern Malawi (Source 7, 10).
