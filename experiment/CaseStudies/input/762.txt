     The research of Bowen and Miskell has generated new ways of thinking       about the value of Swansea's copper-smelting heritage among a variety of       public, political, and policy-maker audiences.
As a result, the location       of former smelting works in the town is now the target of a heritage-led       regeneration plan shaped by their research.
This has been achieved in       three stages: first, an extensive programme of public engagement         activity to communicate research findings about the international       significance of Swansea's historic copper industry; second, the formation       of a formal partnership linking the historians with       representatives from planning and the heritage sector, and the securing of       substantial funding to deliver a major heritage-led regeneration       project; third, the on-site work of preserving and presenting         industrial heritage at the former Hafod-Morfa copper works.
Public Engagement      	Following the decline of copper and its related industries in the         twentieth century, the Lower Swansea Valley became a by-word for British         post-industrial blight.
High levels of toxicity in an environment         peppered with derelict furnaces gave rise to the view among successive         generations of Swansea residents that their industrial history was best         obliterated.
As a result, little survived of the area's copper works and         there was no interpretation to inform public understanding of the         industry's past.
Funded by Bowen's ESRC's follow-on grant, a range of         activities were undertaken to raise awareness of the many ways in which         modern Swansea has been shaped by its copper industry, and to persuade         regeneration and planning officers in local and Welsh government of the         untapped potential of the town's former smelting sites as a heritage         resource.
The highlights were:            A series of briefings undertaken by Bowen to Welsh Government         ministers and officials (15 June 2010, 9 March and 1 Nov. 2011) to         explain the historic importance of the Hafod-Morfa site and how the         research could shape the development of history-led regeneration         projects.
A one-day symposium on `History, Heritage, and Urban Regeneration',         co-sponsored by the Institute of Welsh Affairs (14 Oct. 2010).
Key         research findings were presented to 57 researchers, heritage         practitioners, and policy makers.
A one-day, city-wide Copper Festival in Swansea (5 March 2011) which         attracted an estimated 2,700 visitors.
By 30 Nov. 2011 the Festival         website had received 2,848 unique visitors and had 9,938 page views         (C2).
A temporary exhibition on `The World of Welsh Copper' at the National         Waterfront Museum, Swansea held between 1 July and 30 Oct. 2011 during         which time 104,492 people visited the Museum (C3).
A project website `The World of Welsh Copper' went live on 1 Nov.         2011.
By 31 July 2013 it had received 9,675 unique visitors from 110         countries and generated inquiries for information from over 100 members         of the public (C4).
These activities greatly extended the reach of the research by taking the       findings to new audiences and in doing so they had the effect of       persuading policy makers that Swansea's copper heritage was worth       preserving and utilising in new plans for urban regeneration.
Partnership formation and income generation      	In January 2011 Bowen led the formation of a multi-agency         partnership between local authority policy makers, heritage         practitioners and Swansea University, to explore the regeneration         opportunities offered by the copper heritage of the Lower Swansea Valley         (C5).
The partnership focused on formulating a history-centred         development strategy for the internationally significant Hafod-Morfa         copperworks, on a 12.5 acre site at the heart of Swansea's former         smelting district.
A formal fifteen-year collaboration agreement         between Swansea University and the City and County of Swansea was         reached in 2012.
In August, on behalf of the partnership, Swansea         University secured regeneration grant income totalling &#163;738,072,         including a Cadw-Welsh Government Heritage Tourist Project funding         package of &#163;541,072 (C6).
This package included contributions from the         European Regional Development Fund (&#163;243,450), Cadw-Welsh Government         (&#163;127,622), Swansea Area Regeneration Board (&#163;150,000), and the City and         County of Swansea (&#163;20,000) (C7).
In early 2013 the Minister for         Housing, Regeneration, and Heritage approved two applications for         supplementary funding amounting to &#163;197,000 made to the Welsh         Government's Swansea Regeneration Board.
The securing of these finances         enabled Bowen to lead the third phase of the project &#8212; the development         of the historic site itself.
Preservation and Presentation of Industrial Heritage 	     The original Hafod works was built in 1810.
By the 1980s the site lay         abandoned and derelict, but crucially it contained 12 listed industrial         buildings and structures adjacent to the River Tawe, albeit overgrown         with vegetation, inaccessible and unsafe.
By September 2013, &#163;345,587         had been spent on capital works to secure the historic structures on the         site and to facilitate visitor access.
At all stages, the research         insights of Bowen and Miskell have informed this process.
By September         2013 the main developments were:     i.
Securing the surviving Morfa Works Laboratory building as a       symbol of the importance of scientific innovation on the copper smelting       site.
Work was undertaken to underpin the structure and reconstruct the       north-east elevation (C8).
ii.
Consolidation work to the Vivian Engine Sheds including       vegetation clearance, security and scaffolding support to preserve this       key feature of the Vivian family's development of an integrated copper       smelting business on the site.
(C9)     iii.
Path construction to provide public access to the riverside.
Some 577msq of macadam pathway and 300msq of resurfaced existing pathway       has been completed and plans for the development of the waterfront copper       wharf emphasise the importance of the River Tawe as the gateway to the       industry's overseas markets.
(C10).
iv.
Commissioning and design of artwork and ornamental railings to       provide an entrance feature for the site, involving local school children,       and with historically accurate depictions of copper workers and their       tools.
(C11)     This work has transformed what was a dangerous and unwelcoming place into       an attractive destination.
With a new car park with accommodation for ten       cars and bicycle parking, the site is now easily accessible to visitors,       providing a stimulus to tourism in a previously overlooked part of       the city.
The project has received widespread acclaim.
Cadw's Head of       Regeneration and Conservation stated in March 2011 that `Plans for the         Hafod Copperworks in Swansea are a very good example ... [of] how         heritage can work in creating sustainable places for the future'       (C12).
In April 2012 the local Labour Party manifesto highlighted the       strategic importance of the project, stating that `Swansea Labour         applauds those, such as Swansea University, which work to celebrate our         city's heritage, particularly the Welsh Copper project' (C13).
The       Minister publicly acknowledged the beneficial impact that the project is       already having when he stated that `I am delighted that Welsh         Government Regeneration Area funding is being put to such good use to         benefit so many people and improve the city, which will in turn boost         the local economy' (see C8).
