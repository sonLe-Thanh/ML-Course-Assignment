     The feedback from the project KE workshops led Cheshire, in 2010, to       successfully seek an ESRC Follow-on-Fund award to develop relevant KE       activities (From Sociolinguistic Research to English Language Teaching,       RES -189-25-0181, Jan-Dec 2011, &#163;120,237: Cheshire: PI (QMUL), Fox: CI       (QMUL), Kerswill: CI, (Lancaster, then York).
The bulk of the work was       done by Cheshire and Fox, with some advice from Kerswill.
The researchers worked with a UK-wide advisory panel of 14 teachers and       A-level examiners to produce an online English Language Teaching         Resources Archive (http://linguistics.sllf.qmul.ac.uk/english-language-teaching)       based on their London research projects.
The Archive responds to GCE and       GCSE specifications that ask students to (i) analyse spoken texts using       `appropriate linguistic frameworks and terminology', (ii) study       sociolinguistic aspects of spoken English, (iii) carry out an original       language investigation and (iv) show that they are familiar with relevant       research.
The Archive contains (i) 12 audio clips from the London projects       illustrating genuine conversations between Londoners of different ages and       ethnicities, each with an accompanying transcript; (ii) discussion points       about features of London English and spoken English more generally, as       exemplified in the clips; (iii) a separate guide to features of spoken       English, described using simple, accurate terminology; (iv) 10 suggested       Language Investigations; (v) a linked Linguistics Research Digest blog (http://linguistics-research-digest.blogspot.co.uk)       containing weekly summaries of recent articles from Linguistics research       journals (including 4 on MLE).
Discussion points and Language       Investigations are linked to specific summaries in the Research Digest.
The advisory panel piloted these resources and worked with the researchers       to ensure maximal relevance to the A-level specifications.
Cheshire and Fox disseminated information about MLE and the Teaching       Resources Archive through 3 workshops organized by Fox and Pichler       (Newcastle) on `Analysing Spoken English: resources and techniques': April       18, 2012, Salford; July 5, 2012, QMUL; December 8, 2012, Newcastle       (attended by approx.120 teachers in total); presentations to       A-level teachers and pupils (e.g.
Cheshire, to 30 pupils and 3 teachers at       Kelmscott School, London E17, July 12, 2012); and publications for       English teachers (e.g.
Fox, EMagazine, London: English and Media       Centre, 2008; Fox, chapter on spoken language in Language: A Student         Handbook on Key Topics and Theories, ed.
D. Clayton, London: English       and Media Centre, 2012).
There is a Facebook page for the       Linguistics Research Digest (https://www.facebook.com/pages/Linguistics-Research-Digest/385237578154350).
The Linguistics Association of Great Britain and the British Association       for Applied Linguistics (BAAL) each donated &#163;1000 in 2012 and 2013 for the       Research Digest; the Archive won a further &#163;1000 in BAAL's 2012 `Applying       Linguistics' Competition; (funds were used to subcontract some summaries).
The work has impacted on four beneficiaries:     (i) Teachers of GCE and GCSE English Language, who now have       authentic curriculum-relevant materials on spoken English.
They include teachers         from at least 120 UK schools (those who attended the 3 workshops       above).
Between Jan 2013 and 31 July 2013 the Archive received 18,000 -       20,000 visits per month, of which 60% were return visits (total hits from       transfer to new QMUL web pages in Nov 2012 to end July, 2013 were 167,       219; previous number unobtainable); in the same period the Digest received       7,000- 8000 hits per month (total hits from launch to July 2013 were 137,       763).
Numbers could be confirmed by the QMUL Webmaster.
Teachers'         websites recommend the Resources (e.g.
`There is a fantastic blog       produced by Queen Mary University of London's Linguistics Department.
They       have a real commitment to encouraging A-level students in their study of       the English language.... even better, they have come up with some possible       A2 level investigations and for some, they even suggest a methodology and       research question.... they have even provided access to a whole data bank       of spoken contemporary London English .... this is a fantastic       opportunity' (http://eastnorfolklanguage.blogspot.fr/2013/06/great-leads-for-possible-investigations.html).
45 replies, mainly from GCE and GCSE teachers, to an online survey       posted 13 June 2013 on the Resources Archive were highly positive (e.g.
`The audio and transcripts have been invaluable in helping me prepare       students for the exams and coursework, and the glossary of terms has       always been a handy reference point.
I've used the Linguistics Research       Digest with teachers at AQA meetings to encourage them to find new       material to point students towards and it's always gone down very well'       (6/7/2013 12:01pm).
(2) Students of GCE and GCSE English Language.
MLE now has a       place in the English Language curriculum, which increases students'       understanding of sociolinguistic diversity.
MLE is now represented in 3       widely used UK school textbooks (see section 5).
(3) Teachers and students of EFL/ESL and university-level English         Language in the UK and beyond, evidenced by responses to survey and         personal communication (e.g.
`I teach linguistics, working with       prospective teachers&#8212;and practicing teachers&#8212; in the USA.
This is a       terrific site for them to look at ...and to talk about the phenomena here       in the context of analogous topics in varieties of American English they       know and are likely to encounter', online survey, 1/7/2013 18:50).
Website       analytics show that approx.
60% of the visitors to the Archive are from       the UK, but others originate in more than 30 different countries, from all       continents.
(4) The general public: extensive media dissemination of the       research has contributed to a wider public understanding of London English       (a few examples: Fox, interviews on Capital Radio (April 2006),         BBC Radio London (April 2006), Radio New Zealand (February       2007), BBC Radio 3 Lingua Franca (November 2007), Radio London       (Sunnay and Shay), October 13, 2012; Daily Mail online 26.4.13, Guardian         online 26.7.13.
MLE featured in the British Library's exhibition Evolving         English (12 Nov 2010 -3 April 2011), the Celebrate Cockney       initiative, King's Place, London (July 2010) and even in The Guardian         Weekend Quiz, Nov 3, 2012, p.101 (`what is MLE?')
Many more examples       could be given.
Emails and comments posted on the Linguistics Research Digest blog       provide evidence of interest from members of the public.
