     Hilger Crystals Ltd (Hilger) manufactures a range of synthetic crystals       for X-ray and Infra-red applications.
The collaboration between Hilger and       the School of Physical Sciences (SPS) dates back more than 10 years and       builds on the expertise of Prof. Chadwick and Dr Mountjoy in defect       chemistry and analysis of their local structure using XAFS measurements       [2,3].
The latest KTP project [4] (co-ordinated by Dr. Alfredsson)       followed a CASE-studentship between Prof. Chadwick and Hilger (Drs.
Telfer, Hutton and Blacklocks).
This is an on-going collaboration and       further results are to be expected.
The new growth method stemming from SPS's collaboration with Hilger is       robust for producing moderate volumes of low afterglow (Tl,Cs)I in       relatively low capital cost plant, permitting Hilger to be competitive       with low cost manufacturers in China etc.
Only a few crystal growers       worldwide have been able to achieve this and it has given the company a       competitive advantage.
This has allowed Hilger to expand its market and       seek customers in high-end applications of X-ray imaging such as air       transport and sea cargo screening and medical diagnostic devices.
Despite the disadvantages detailed above the rare-earth doped crystals       are also of interest for some specialist applications.
As a result of the new product, derived from the collaboration with the       University, the company has recruited new staff, including one new       research scientist as well as other high-quality technical staff &#8212; a key       requirement for future growth.
The new material enables great market penetration for high-performance       end sales to X-ray imaging companies throughout the world.
All of the       company's current customers are located outside the UK.
Hence, all sales       are export sales, mostly to the USA.
The new material increased the annual       sales turnover by c.&#163;45k the first year it was launched in 2012 and is       projected (based on past experience, by the company) to improve the annual       sales turnover in the next three years' time to &#163;250k, which corresponds       to about 35% of the company's annual export volume.

http://www.hilger-crystals.co.uk/prior/detectors.htm          A positive effect on the reputation and advertisement of Hilger Crystals       Ltd, resulted in the company being acquired by one of their largest       competitors in 2010, becoming a partner of the Dynasil group, which       specialises in advanced materials for a broad range of applications, with       markets in the medical, industrial, defence, as well as the homeland       security, sectors.
This occurred while the product described in this case       study was under development and hence the potential future profits from       this product will have contributed to Hilger's attractiveness to Dynasil.
Hilger Crystals grow crystals for other companies to use in x-ray       scanners and other devices.
These are sold into, and employed in, the       security and medical industries.
Hence societal impact is "downstream" and       we can only describe this aspect of the impact in general terms.
Principal Impact            A new product has successfully been developed with a low afterglow         that exceeded original expectations.
While the new crystals only became available for sale in 2012, Hilger         already has four client companies which have purchased the crystals and,         thereby, have been able to manufacture and sell cheaper scanners that         yield higher quality images.
Hilger's managing director informed the University that currently         (June 2013) there are about 50 detectors using these crystals in use in         security and medical diagnostic roles.
Subsidiary Impact            Indirectly this work contributes to improved security at national         entry points.
This work contributes to improved medical diagnostics (particularly         mammography).
The product is currently around 7%, and projected to reach 35%, of the         company's sales.
As all of the company's current customers are located outside the UK,         all sales are export sales and hence it produces income and tax revenue         to the UK.
Current customers have been retained, and new customers secured, by         the company.
New staff has been hired, including a research scientist and high         quality technical staff to expand the company's research base.
Exclusion of rare-earth dopants makes the material less expensive than         the originally proposed product.
In 2010 Hilger was incorporated into the Dynasil group, based in the         USA, improving the company's research profile with the aim to develop         new X-ray imaging materials.
A number of academic-related benefits including: (i) Hilger acting as         industrial partners in the EU-funded Interreg projects and (ii) SPS is         organising the international meeting EURODIM2014.
The collaboration with         Hilger is assisting the University in attracting world-leading speakers         from industrial and academic backgrounds.
Generated research income to the University of Kent: (directly)         &#163;150,000 and (indirectly) &#163;300,000-&#163;350,000.
