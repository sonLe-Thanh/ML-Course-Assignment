     Welsh's research on the responsibility of states and international       organisations to protect populations from mass atrocity crimes has had a       significant impact on the policy of the UN and its member states and on       expertise and capacity building within the wider R2P policy community.
Her       research insights were a critical consideration in her appointment as       Special Adviser to the UN Secretary-General on the Responsibility to       Protect in 2013.

Promoting an understanding of prevention and response as         integrated aspects of R2P policies     Welsh is one of the leading authorities on R2P.
Her work on the     clarification of the R2P responsibilities of states, the nature of the     crimes that R2P should address, and her arguments that prevention and     response should be integrated in R2P policies, have led to discussions with     policy makers at the highest level, including:M            UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, culminating in Welsh's appointment         as Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect in 2013;       UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Francis Deng in         2012;       UN Secretary General's Special Adviser on R2P (at the time) Edward         Luck and Gareth Evans the former foreign minister of Australia (one of         the original authors of the R2P principle) in 2008;       High Commissioner for National Minorities of the Organisation for         Security and Co- operation in Europe (OSCE) (at the time) Knut Vollebaek         and his advisers in 2012 [C1];       The Policy Committee of the European Parliament in a special session         on R2P dedicated to formulating policy on the implementation of R2P         after Libya (March 2012) [See R4];        Policy makers within the UK, through consultations with officials in         the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 2008.

Shaping UN policy to integrate prevention and response,           and UN definitions of the crimes to which R2P applies       One of Welsh's central research contributions is to clarify how mass       atrocities can be prevented by the systemic and targeted use of preventive       tools and by integrating preventive action and response [R4, R7].
This analysis is reflected in the UN Secretary General's 2012 report, Responsibility         to Protect: Timely and Decisive Response.
The report departs from       previous reports on the issue and reflects Welsh's research in emphasising       the key insight that prevention and response are closely connected and       must be structured to support each other [C2].
Thus, it examines       the range of tools available under the third (response) pillar and the       close connection between prevention and response [C3].
The report       explicitly notes that, `[s]ome may consider that prevention and         response are at opposite ends of the spectrum.
In practice, however, the         two often merge.....
It may be argued that the first two pillars of the         implementation strategy address prevention, and the third, response.
The         dividing lines are, however, not so clear in practice' (paragraph       11).
Furthermore, `[e]ffective action under the first and second         pillar may make action under the third pillar unnecessary.
Pillar three         action should also contribute to the future achievement of first pillar         goals ... an informed and calibrated response can serve preventive goals         as well' (paragraph 15) [C3].
The prevention of atrocity       crimes (as opposed to the reactive response to unfolding mass atrocities)       is now a key consideration for the UN.
Welsh's research made a substantial       contribution in shaping that objective [R7].
Welsh's work on the nature of the crimes that R2P should address is       currently informing revisions of the Framework of Analysis used by       the Office of the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide.
Initially the framework, which is a policy tool to support the assessment       of risk, was limited to genocide.
Drawing on developments from R2P, it is       being revised to include three further types of mass atrocities: ethnic       cleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity [C4].

Shaping acceptance of the integration of prevention and           response in R2P policies by UN member states       Through its impact on the UN Secretary General's report, Welsh's research       has shaped UN member-states' acceptance of the need to develop the       preventive dimension in policies to mitigate the risk of mass atrocity       crimes and to integrate the use of preventive tools with response.
This is       evidenced by the General Assembly debate of the report on September 5,       2012 in which UN member-states expressed strong support for the insight       that prevention and response are interconnected and that R2P's third       pillar has an important preventive component (only some of these can be       reported here).
As Denmark stressed: `Running through all three pillars         is an absolute commitment to prevention: prevention of an initial         outbreak of a crisis or conflict, prevention of its continuation and         escalation, and prevention of recurrence ... Prevention is part of         response.
Prevention and response are thus mutually reinforcing, and         elements of both must be integrated.'
The Republic of Korea noted       that, `one should not draw too sharp a distinction between prevention         and response...the three pillars are not sequential and are of equal         importance; without all three, the concept would be incomplete.'
Estonia concurred with the conclusions of the report on `the proximity         of the prevention and response sides of the R2P implementation....
The         International Criminal Court (ICC) ... is an example of one of the R2P         tools where the response and prevention sides of the implementation         strategy may merge, illustrating thus that strict sequencing the R2P         pillars would not be useful.'
Direct reference to the use of       preventive tools is also made in the response of the Netherlands, which       stresses that `commissions of enquiry, mediation, sanctions, arms         embargoes, referral to the ICC and civil missions are all important         instruments in such a toolbox' [C2,C5].

Contributing to policy expertise and capacity building       Welsh's research has contributed in multiple ways to policy expertise and       capacity building in the wider community of policy institutes and NGOs       that focus on the prevention of mass atrocities.
The Global Centre for the       Responsibility to Protect uses Welsh's research in its own policy forums       to focus the discussion with policy makers on preventive tools as a means       to make R2P policies effective.
The Centre considers Welsh's work to be       one of the few resources available to support debate on prevention [C6].
Similarly, the Stanley Foundation stresses the benefits of Welsh's       research in structuring its work with policy actors on preventing the       perpetration of mass atrocity crimes.
The Asia-Pacific Centre for the       Responsibility to Protect has reproduced Welsh's research findings in its       own policy briefs and regards the ELAC project as the most robust and       policy- relevant of the 14 projects funded by the Australian R2P fund [C7,C8].
In sum, Welsh's research is shaping the approach to prevention and       response of mass atrocities by the UN, its member states and the wider       policy community.
This has implications for the choices of states and       international organisations that may invest lives and resources to prevent       mass atrocities, for populations at risk, and the perpetrators of such       crimes.
The reach and significance of the impact of Professor Welsh's       research is evidenced by her appointment in July 2013 by the UN       Secretariat as Special Adviser to Ban Ki-moon, at the Assistant Secretary       General Level [C9, C10].
