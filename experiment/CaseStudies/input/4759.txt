     The research contributed to the first nationally consistent approach to       curriculum for SWD in all states and territories in Australia (2009-2014).
It was not until 2010 that SWD were seriously considered as learners and       that specific curriculum considerations were needed to accommodate them as       part of the Australian Curriculum.
The research report has been pivotal in       developing policy-awareness of this issue, and has been instrumental in       helping to secure resources to support the initiatives it recommended (to       the tune of $A200m to 2012, with a further $A100 from 2013).
Moreover, by       providing ACARA with a set of curriculum development themes, the study has       helped to formulate a national discussion regarding curriculum       arrangements for SWD.
The following actions/events indicate the extent of       this influence:            the report has been pivotal in the knowledge and understanding of some         key senior policy makers within the ACARA organisation in relation to         SWD (Evidence1)       the report has been used to shape the advice to teachers and the         processes used in the development of the curriculum content in the         Australian Curriculum (Evidence2)       The report has highlighted for ACARA the need to include in ACARA         annual work plans the connection between curriculum and assessment for         SWD (Evidence3 &amp; 8).
the report has been influential in ensuring that meetings of the ACARA         Students with Disability Advisory Group(SWDAG) has a standing         item on its agenda addressing curriculum issues for this group of         students (Evidence3)       Substantive elements within the report (notably, its `Opportunities to         Improve Provision' section) have been adopted as guiding principles used         by ACARA to frame future curriculum and assessment planning (Evidence3             &amp;4)       The report has been used to inform the members of the new assessment         working party of ACARA (Evidence 3)       Demonstrating progression &amp; sustainability of research networks,         the study is being used (September, 2013) as the basis for an Australian         Research Council (ARC) research proposal by a consortium of Universities         in partnership with ASEPA, ACARA, Department Education Employment and         Workplace Relation (DEEWR) and Australian Institute of Teaching and         School Leadership (AITSL) to look at the impact on the implementation of         the Australian Curriculum for SWD (Evidence 9)          Since the research has been presented to ACARA it has been used in a       variety of ways, firstly as a discussion tool within the organisation with       key policy makers and with the ACARA Students with Disability Advisory       Group (Evidence 3).
The group were regularly updated on the       research findings in order to shape decision-making in a dynamic and       evolving policy-making environment, against specific national timelines.
As consultation was a major theme of the research findings and was made up       of policy makers and major professional associations there was opportunity       for wider consultation of several significant draft publications.
This       started with draft advice to teachers on SWD (Evidence 2) and       progressed to additional content being produced in two subject areas,       Mathematics and English (Evidence 7) for students who were yet to       reach the first (basic) level of the curriculum.
The sections in the       research which addressed inclusion, appropriateness and flexibility       contributed to the thinking that informed the curriculum development (Evidence         3).
ACARA have used the research to inform writers not only in the       four areas of the curriculum that have already been produced in Phase one       of curriculum development (Evidence 3) but also to shape the       thinking of the Phase two subjects that are currently under development.
(Evidence         3)     There were key messages in the research that hold significance for the       work-plan of ACARA going forward into 2014 and beyond.
There was a       decision for the purposes of ACARA's internal use to separate the two       phases of the research into the published literature review and the       internally useful policy and practice section.
Many participants on the       working group noted that the data should be used in a dynamic way by       ACARA, as a starting point for discussions with the State and Territory       administrations, especially in the areas of assessment and reporting (Evidence         3).
As a result of the heightened awareness the research provided, a number       of subsequent initiatives were developed.
The Federal Minister of       Education convened a working party (including members of the SWDAG) to       give advice on supporting SWD in schools.
This group met on 3 occasions       and used draft findings from the UoN research to help shape its feedback       submitted to the Minister.
The six themes can be seen woven through       criteria and outcomes of the subsequent National Partnership - More       Support for Students with Disabilities (Evidence 5).
This       A$300m over 3 years is currently in year 2 of its roll out, and its usage       as identified in the first progress reports of Western Australia (WA), New       South Wales (NSW), and Tasmania (TAS) (Evidence 6)indicates clear       reference to the six themes in the commissioned study (Evidence 10).
Impressively NSW in their first progress report showed that 1800 teachers       from 700 government schools (representing coverage of almost 25% of       schools in the State) had participated in online training, based in part       on the themes identified in the study, in a variety of SWD categories to       build the skills knowledge and understanding in order to better support       SWD learning outcomes.
The suggested developments in curriculum provision for SWD, resulting in       part and as evidenced, by the research conducted by the UoN team, have       thus been widely considered at Federal policy level in Australia and,       directly as a result of this, have brought resource benefits which have       impacted positively on the educational progress of children and young       people in its States and Territories.
