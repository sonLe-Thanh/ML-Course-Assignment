     The IRS's products, methodology and conceptual work have made impact       across Human Computer       Interaction (HCI) and Interaction Design, including large technology       companies (Microsoft, Intel,       IBM) concerned with how computing enters everyday life as well as cultural       institutions that explore       technological possibilities.
Methodological Impact: The Microsoft Research Laboratory       (MRL) has taken up IRS methods:            Microsoft researchers have used Cultural Probes, e.g.
for a project on         intelligent machines with         researchers from MIT Media Lab and the Stockholm Mobile Life project,         and for MRL work on         technology heirlooms which "built a range of interactive probes to           explore concepts of the passing           on and inheriting of digital data.
"[1] Thus the         Deputy MD of MRL writes: "the seminal notion of           cultural probes as a means to elicit surprising designs has inspired           us in our research into the           digital aspects of home life, and in our more recent work on the           meaning of big data to the local           community."
The Studio's `in-the-wild' research has resulted in the MRL adopting         its methods: according to the         Deputy Managing Director: "the emphasis that the Studio have placed           on building and deploying           prototypes and evaluating them through lived interpretation has           provided us with a valuable           counterpoint to more quantitative techniques for studying ubiquitous           computing systems."
The Co-Manager of Socio-Digital Systems at MRL[1]         writes that "the design-led methodologies           that come from this group have expanded not just the repertoire of           approaches we use in our           work, but they have had a game-changing impact on the field of           Human-Computer Interaction           more broadly" because they "offer much needed alternatives to           the tried and tested social science           methodologies in the field and have led instead to a more eclectic and           energising set of           techniques which has helped to cement the central importance of design           in this community."
Conceptual Impact: The studio's conceptual work has       influenced Intel's approach to products:[2]            Intel financed a collaborative project called "Supporting Reflection         on Well-being in the Digital         Home" from 2004-2007 with the Studio and Cornell researchers.
Two         designs using ambiguity to         promote engagement were produced and discussed during presentations at         Intel in Portland.
Conceptual work on ambiguity developed in part by this project was         cited as a primary source in         award-winning Intel research.
[3]        IRS and Intel staff have made regular visits to each other to share         insights, with the Manager of         the Cultural Transformations Lab, Intel Corporation[2]         explaining: "Intel labs is pursing a research           and product agenda around new relationships, not interactions, with           technology.
Dr. Bill Gaver           and The Studio's work around the importance of ambiguity in design is           one of our organizing           principles.
Personal wellness data sensing devices that we wear or           intelligent devices in our           homes, can no longer stand out as `technologies' but must blend with           other objects in our lives.
Further, Intel products have global reach: designing around ambiguity           enables people with           different social, cultural and economic backgrounds to interpret the           technologies in meaningful           ways to themselves.
Over the years, we have continuously looked to Dr.           Gaver and The Studio           as a source of new insights and design methods &#8212; they continue to           provide innovation that has           value to the corporation."
Impact of Products and Making:     Both the products made by the Studio and its practice-based processes       have impact:            IRS products have been chosen to represent new trends in interaction         design.
For instance, the         Prayer Companion was exhibited at MOMA from July-Nov 2011 and again from         March-Jan 2012,         and has been acquired for their permanent design collection.
[4]         Other IRS designs have appeared         in exhibitions in Spain, Sweden, the US and UK.
Microsoft product research has reflected the Studio's products.
"The           concepts and prototypes that           come from the Studio are provocative and insightful, and many have           influenced our own research           themes over the years."
[1] The MRL Principal         Design Manager has said: "The studio's blend of           nuanced social science and exemplary design craft have inspired our           own work, both in the way           we discuss the role of design in research, and on the types and           qualities of artefacts we develop           and deploy.
Our work on digital heirlooms, for example, was heavily           influenced by the objects         developed by the studio."
[5]        The Studio's development of fully-finished prototypes impacted on the         development of a rapid-         prototyping platform commercialised by Microsoft.
The system, called .Net           Gadgeteer, is being         used by increasing numbers of professional prototypers, educators,         hobbyists and inventors to         rapid-prototype computational products.
In 2011-12, the computer         scientist responsible for the         original and sustained development of the system (a researcher from the         Sensors and Devices         Group) was seconded to the studio to help develop the Indoor           Weatherstations, a set of sensor-based         devices that used a hard- and software prototyping platform that he had         been developing.
He has noted:          "The team's detailed feedback about what worked and what didn't was         very useful in the drafting         of the final Gadgeteer hardware specification, which is used today by         the various commercial         hardware manufacturers that make and sell Gadgeteer-compatible products       [e.g.
GHI       Electronics, Sytech and Seeed Studio] ....
The success of the         collaboration has directly         contributed to the Microsoft Research Connections team (which         coordinates engagements and         funding programs for academia) reconsidering the importance of engaging         with design schools         to be on a par with computer science departments....
This was         particularly evidenced by the         inauguration of the 'Design Day' at this year's Microsoft Faculty         Summit, where the work that the         IRS team did with Gadgeteer was highlighted."
Impact of the Studio's Overall Approach     The combination of methodologies, products and concepts that comprise the       IRS approach has had       a cumulative impact[6] on the technology and HCI sector.
This has been felt beyond the technology       industry to other players such as the BBC, who hired Gaver to give a       keynote address to the UX&amp;D       Connected Studio event on 30 October, 2012: "Bill Gaver and his group         have been a strong force in         keeping personal emotional narrative as a key care-about for design in a         digital age.
Teams like this,         that champion the individual, the lyrical, the intuitive with rigour and         demanding models of enquiry         are rare and important."
[5]     Gaver has also been funded by IBM from 2000-2002, and kept in regular       contact with researchers       since that time.
For instance, he has been commissioned to write a chapter       on science and design       for a book on `ways of knowing in HCI' co-edited by the founder of the       Social Computing Group at       IBM's T. J. Watson Research Center.
[7] She explains: "Gaver         and team's work has catalyzed a better         understanding of design within the worldwide HCI community, from         articulating entirely new         perspectives on design (ambiguity as a resource, design proposals) to         providing innovative and         widely adopted tools for understanding users (cultural probes), to         defining an emerging "third         paradigm" of HCI that underscores the significance of users' experience         of designed artifacts.
Truly         remarkable, transformational work."
