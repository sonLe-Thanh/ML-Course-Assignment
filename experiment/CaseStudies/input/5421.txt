     Process &amp; events from research to impact:       The Vice President Research &amp; Development at DePuy International       [Source A] brought the       leaching of metal ions from metal orthopaedic implants to Grant's       attention in 2006.
The research       was then funded by DePuy (2006-2011) and the results directly disseminated       to them at regular 6       monthly research meetings (September 2007 - March 2011).
The main       collaborator was Mr       Dominic Meek, consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Southern General hospital,       who provided access       to patient samples, and advised on all clinical aspects of the work       [Source B].
Professor Helen       Grant initiated and was PI on the project, developing it from her interest       in toxicology of metals.
The main industrial collaborator at DePuy HQ, at Leeds, at the most       crucial time (2009-2011) was       Professor Graham Isaac, Senior Engineering Fellow (Hips), who had direct       responsibility for design       and monitoring of hip implants for DePuy International [Source C].
All project data was transmitted by transatlantic telephone conference to       DePuy scientists and       lawyers in USA, in addition to our industrial collaborators in Leeds.
We       summarised all data on            ASR patient blood levels of cobalt &amp; chromium compared with other         implants;        Levels of circulating white blood cells and subpopulations of         lymphocytes in patients with         ASR and other implants       Dissemination of cobalt &amp; chromium ions in mice that had received         ASR wear debris         implants       Expression of local inflammatory markers in response to ASR wear         debris       Toxicity of Co and Cr ions to human lymphocytes in vitro.
Mr Meek also received the data; attended meetings with the team from       DePuy, and disseminated       information to colleagues at professional &amp; clinical meetings.
Professor Grant presented data at a       meeting on safety of metal orthopaedic hips, to a group of UK orthopaedic       surgeons and implant       manufacturers in June 2008.
This initiated multi-centre discussions among       surgeons on the       importance of metal ion release.
The Strathclyde data on blood metal ion       levels in patients and the       effect of kidney function on metal accumulation was presented at the       British Orthopaedic Society in       September 2009, and discussed with surgeons directly.
Furthermore, Prof Grant was a member of MHRA (Medical &amp; Healthcare       Regulatory Authority)       Expert Group on the Biological Safety of Metal Orthopaedic implants (2006-       2010), and took an       active part in the committee meeting that agreed on the safety cut-off       level of 7 03bcg/l for either Co or       Cr ions in the blood of patients with ASR implants as quoted in MHRA       Medical Device Alert       MDA/2010/069.
This committee was attended by several orthopaedic surgeons,       who transmitted       the discussions directly into practice, disseminating the information       rapidly to their clinical       colleagues, via the professional societies, British Hip Society &amp;       British Orthopaedic Society [Source       D].
Types of impact:            Impact on the DePuy company's commercial decision making.
Impact on patient health: concerted focus on patient health, removal         of implants if required,         and prevention of long-term metallosis.
Impact on NHS policy: with renewed focus and understanding of risks         involved, the Medical         and Healthcare Regulatory Agency, the device regulatory authority, has         continued to         investigate the biological safety of metal-on-metal (MOM) implants         issuing guidelines and         updates.
Influence on hip replacement design: awareness of the release of metal         ions from MOM         implants led to a general decline in this type of articulation, not just         the DePuy ASRTM         design       Economic benefit for patients successfully suing the DePuy company          Impact on DePuy: The research findings were discussed with DePuy       at six month intervals.
DePuy International recognised the problem of metal ion release from the       ASR implants, and acted       to withdraw them from the market, limiting the damage and thus avoiding a       larger scale incidence       of adverse effects worldwide.
The company issued a voluntary withdrawal       notice on 24 August       2010 taking the ASR device off the market immediately [Source E].
The use       of ASR implant first       declined, and then completely stopped when the device was withdrawn.
Resurfacing implants       comprised 10% of all hip replacements between 2004 and 2007, but accounted       for less than 2.5%       of the total in 2011.
Impact on health: There are circa 93,000 patients with ASR       implants worldwide whose health had       been impacted since 2010.
Considerable numbers of people have had their       circulating blood metal       ions levels measured, and as a result the National Joint Registry for       England and Wales 9th Annual       Report (2012) states that revision rates (removal and replacement of the       implant by another type of       articulation) for the ASR implant after 7 years in situ was 24.22%       of all patients.
Measurement of       blood metal ions is now an accepted part of monitoring MOM implants in       situ world-wide.
Had this       release of metal ions from MOM hip implants gone undetected, the       toxicological and health       consequences for the increasing number of patients receiving these       implants worldwide would       have continued to increase.
Impact on NHS practice and procedures: Professor Grant was a       member of the expert group       `Biological Effects of Wear Debris from Metal-on-Metal Bearing Surfaces'       that discussed the       recommended limit of 7 03bcg/l circulating metal ions levels in the blood       of patients with MOM hip       implants.
Awareness of the risk of metal ion release from metallic       implants was highlighted by the       Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and in April       2010 an initial       Medical Device Alert was released.
This was followed in September 2010       with an immediate action       notice to medical directors, orthopaedic surgeons and staff involved in       the management of patients       with joint replacement implants.
Specific instructions given at that time       were "Do not implant DePuy         ASR hip replacements.
Return all unused ASR hip replacement implants to         the manufacturer.
Inform all patients implanted with ASR hip replacements about this         recall and schedule them for a         follow-up visit."
[Source F]     Impact on manufacture of joint replacements: The MHRA Medical       Device Alerts brought the       health risks of metallosis to the attention of manufacturers, and the       trend has moved significantly       away from the use of metal&#8212;on-metal hip implants towards alternative       articulations.
Economic impact: Many patients worldwide are now suing DePuy; the       research findings from the       Strathclyde project have been used as evidence in a number of these cases       in Scotland.
By the       end of July 2013 more than 11,000 cases against DePuy are pending in US       law courts alone, and       the first compensation case in USA was settled in March 2013 with award of       8.3 million US Dollars       [Source G]
