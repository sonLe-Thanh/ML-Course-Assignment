     Barlow's research at Exeter on cohabitation, marriage and the law has       been at the forefront of the fiercely contested public and policy debates       over cohabitation law reform &#8212; an issue central to the lives of 2.9       million cohabiting couples and their children.
It has also strongly         influenced and/or informed policy thinking and public         information1 around family property and financial       provision on relationship breakdown here and in Germany and was used         by government to oppose cohabitation law reform in parliamentary       debates.
The Law Commission's 2007 report on The Financial Consequences of         Cohabitation cited Barlow's Exeter research 20 times to underpin its       recommendations for reform to enhance legal remedies for cohabiting       couples2.
The report's impact continued well into 2008 as the       government deliberated over the Commission's recommendation to introduce       new legal rights for cohabiting couples upon separation.
Barlow was active       in influencing the reform debates.
In January 2008, she presented       her conclusions at the media launch of the 24th British Social Attitudes       Survey.
National media including The Guardian and Radio 4's Woman's         Hour reported the findings, highlighting continuing public ignorance       over common law marriage.7 The Nuffield Foundation invited       Barlow to deliver her findings to policymakers, lawyers, judges and       academics.
In March 2008 she gave a public lecture at the Institute of       Advanced Legal Studies, London.
As a result of this dissemination, the         research became widely known and was used by Resolution, (the       Solicitors' Family Law Association), to support its national campaign to         call for reform of cohabitation law.8     The government announcement in March 2008 that it would take no action on       the Law Commission's recommendations until research evaluated the similar       scheme in Scotland prompted Resolution, in a statement covered by BBC       News, to accuse the government of being "seriously out of step with public       opinion", citing Barlow's research.
The debate continued into 2009,       culminating in a Private Member's Cohabitation Bill by Liberal Democrat       peer Lord Lester, supported by Resolution.
Resolution and Lester's offices       contacted Barlow after her Nuffield seminar and the research informed         the Bill's contents.8.
A briefing paper summarising her       research was sent to MPs and peers to inform the parliamentary debates and       proved instrumental to both sides.
During the second reading of the Bill       in the Lords on March 13, 2009, the Attorney General cited Barlow's         findings of improved public awareness resulting from the Living Together         Campaign to justify government policy opposing the Bill, which       consequently did not progress beyond Committee stage, stating, 'The media         campaign LivingTogether is now in its fourth year.
A study by Professor         Anne Barlow has assessed that campaign, and she says that it is very         positive.'
(Hansard 13 Mar 2009 : Column 1441).6     In 2009, One Plus One, a UK charity that aims to strengthen relationships       through the provision of online educational resources, cited the research       across its publications.
Warnings that common law marriage has no legal       basis &#8212; drawn from Barlow's Exeter research findings &#8212; currently feature       prominently on the website of Directgov, the official UK government       website providing digital information to citizens, and AdviceNow, a       not-for-profit website providing legal advice to 450,000 visitors each       year.1.
Thus her research has shaped legal advice and         information.
Barlow's Living Together Campaign evaluation was       published on the MoJ website in 2007; it is still available and its       contents secured further funding for the campaign.
A legal aid       leaflet published in 2009 by the Legal Services Commission references       Barlow's continuing common law marriage myth.
A 2012 Home Office report on       cohabitation for all Members of Parliament (available in the House of       Commons library) drew on Barlow's Exeter data, stating9,     `Generally...there is no specific legal status for what is often         referred to as a "common law marriage".
Studies have shown that many         cohabiting couples are unaware of this fact.'
Lady Hale in the Supreme Court in Gow v Grant [2012] UKSC 29       exhorted government to reform English cohabitation law in line with Scots       Law and at para.
51 cited Barlow's findings to call on policy makers       to take account of cohabitation very often being a prelude to marriage,       saying, `This case also illustrates the fact, well-established by         research, that many, even most, couples do not deliberately reject         marriage (A. Barlow et al, 2005).'
Barlow's cohabitation and community of property research alongside her       analysis of the value given by law to unpaid caregiving within different       styles of family has informed policy debates in Germany, where       following her 2007 lecture to academics and policymakers, it formed a       chapter in a 2008 policy document by the German Ministry of Families       presented to government to inform its review of the valuation of domestic       contributions to family life in family/welfare law (Barlow, 2008).
Other       research by Barlow has been central to Law Commission activities.
The       Commission's 2009 consultation paper on intestacy referenced Barlow's       Exeter cohabitation research 10 times, with its 2011 report citing it in       five places.
Her research showing the continued existence of the       common law marriage myth (Barlow et al 2008) was confirmed as `a         powerful factor' in the Commission recommending and drafting a         Bill giving qualifying cohabitants automatic succession rights from       their deceased partner's estate on intestacy (Law Commission, 2011).3       The Community of Property research and Barlow's recent Pre-nuptial       Agreements study are cited in the Commission's 2011 and 2012 consultations       on Marital Property Agreements some six times.4,5 Their 2012       paper confirms `We were assisted by research ...carried out by         Professor Anne Barlow and Dr Janet Smithson of the University of Exeter'.5       The Commission plans to use the academics' data in its final report,       anticipating that it will provide "important indications" of public       attitudes towards pre-nuptial agreements and organised a joint conference       with Barlow for policymakers, academics and practitioners on 4 December       2012 to discuss reform in the light of research evidence.
Her pre-nuptial agreement research is also influencing the judiciary.
Mr Justice Coleridge invited Barlow to present this research at a Marriage       Foundation conference to a large audience of practitioners and policy       makers on 15th February 2013 and Lady Hale indicated in her       plenary address to the SLSA conference in March 2013 that if it had been       published in time, she `would no doubt have referred to it' in her       dissenting judgment in Radmacher v Granatino [2010] UKSC 42.10
