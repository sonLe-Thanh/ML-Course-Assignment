     Over the years, IEPR researchers have worked on a number of       externally-funded projects on Social Inclusion.
These include, for       example, projects funded by the DFES, the Learning and Skills Development       Agency, and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.
These earlier projects enabled       us to gain experience of research in this field and acted as a springboard       to submitting further bids to other funders.
They also allowed us to build       a reputation as researchers examining Social Inclusion issues, and       facilitated funding from other funders.
We note below the impact of three       of our later projects, mentioned in Section 2 above:     Davies, P., Slack, K., Hughes, A., Mangan, J. and Vigurs, K. (2008) Knowing           where to Study?
Fees, Bursaries and Fair Access.
Report to The         Sutton Trust.
This project report has been widely referred to in the press, e.g.
the Guardian       front page headline; cited by pressure / special interest groups, e.g.
BMA,         Canadian Federation of Students, National Union of Students, UCU, ISC,         UUK, Global Higher Education, Royal College of Nurses, HEPI, NFER;       and quangos, e.g.
OFFA and the Higher Education Academy.
It has       also been referred to directly in government papers: It was one of the few       research studies referred to in Alan Milburn's report, `Unleashing         Aspiration: the final report of the panel on fair access to the         professions', published by the Cabinet Office.
It is also cited in       the BIS research paper, `The role of finance in the decision-making of         higher education applicants and students'.
The impact of the project       is evident in the fact that the Government used this report to justify its       policy on fair access.

(2008) Fair Admissions           to Higher Education: A Review of the Implementation of the Schwartz           Report Principles Three Years on.
Report to SPA       Through a survey of senior managers responsible for admissions, and 10       case studies, this review found that a number of principles in the       Schwartz Report had been successfully adopted by the sector, particularly       in relation to the areas of transparency, continuing professional       development, aspects of professionalism, and the use of technology to       share resources and information.
The project resulted in a series of good       practice guides, which were widely distributed.
The following paper, which       is in Routledge's Highly-Cited Research Collection, was published from the       above project.

Report to HEFCE.
The above project was one of the two research studies commissioned by       HEFCE on which most of the proposals in its November 2010 document, `Public         information about Higher Education' are based.
It was cited by the       Government White Paper, `Putting Students at the Heart of Higher         Education' (BIS, June 2011, p.28).
The findings of the report were       also mentioned in the media, e.g.
Times Higher Education (13-19       December, 2012, pp.38-41).
Further, the expertise in areas related to       Information, Advice and Guidance (IAG) has enabled the IEPR team to lead       two locally- based initiatives on IAG.
The first is with three secondary       schools and one FE college to develop IAG materials for school/college       students.
These are currently being trialled at all four institutions.
This project is significant because of the recent Government policy to       devolve IAG to schools.
The second focuses on mature students, involving       one FE college, Platform51, the Prince's Trust, and Adult and Community       Learning in Stoke-on-Trent.
Research is currently underway with learners       engaged with these agencies to investigate their specific IAG needs.
Representatives from the agencies will then work with us to co-develop IAG       resources for learners.
The following papers were published from the above       project.
