     Since 2008, BiCE programme research has had wide-ranging impact, from the       establishment of a successful spinout company to commercialisation of a       miniature bioreactor technology.
A number of pharmaceutical companies now       using BiCE enzymes are benefiting from cost and time savings in their       production process, along with reduced waste production.
These impacts are       summarised below and can be traced back directly to the original research       outputs identified above.
Spinout company creation: To capitalise on the knowledge       generated in the BiCE programme, Prof John Ward and researchers at UCL set       up the synthetic biology spin-out company, Synthace Ltd, in 2011.
This       aims to make high-value, bio-based chemical and biological products       through the application of synthetic biology.
It is the UK's first       dedicated synthetic biology company start-up.
Synthace is based in UCL Biochemical Engineering and had completed two       rounds of investment funding as of 31 July 2013.
These successful funding       rounds have brought its total financing to &#163;1.8m with TSB funding of       &#163;500,000 and a recent second stage finance of &#163;1.3m from Sofinnova       Partners' Green Seed Fund and a syndicate of angel investors [a].
The CEO       of Synthace said: "With its world-leading development and scale-up         facilities, UCL Biochemical Engineering is the ideal place for a         start-up like Synthace as we seek to industrialise advances in synthetic         biology" [b].
Synthace has licensed enzyme libraries established in       the BiCE programme and currently uses these in sizeable commercial       contracts from three major companies.
In March 2013, the Universities and       Science Minister, The Rt Hon David Willetts, recognised the contribution       of Synthace to an "increasingly important" section of the UK       economy, when he said: "Companies like Synthace can help the UK         exploit the massive potential that synthetic biology has both here and         abroad.
By making investment in technology now, it will ensure that in         ten years' time the UK is at the forefront of the global race when it         comes to commercialising new technologies" [b].
Economic benefits in terms of new products and cost and time           savings: Since 2008, many of the new bioprocess tools       developed as part of the research described above have been adopted by       consortium companies for their industrial biocatalytic processes.
Examples       of the impact of these technologies include:             Commercialisation of a miniature stirred bioreactor technology.
The UCL design for a novel miniature stirred bioreactor technology         enabling direct scale-up from 30 mL to 10L was commercialised via HEL         Ltd and has been on the market since 2008.
The miniature bioreactor         enables rapid testing of new fermentation applications with data         gathering that fully matches the large scale.
This saves time and cost         in avoiding running large-scale fermentations while testing a         fermentation protocol.
These miniature bioreactors (30-500 mL)         represented a new product line for the company [c] [text removed for         publication].
Industrial adoption of high throughput bioprocess design           methodologies.
A number of BiCE programme industrial partners have         now adopted UCL high-throughput and microscale technologies to help         speed the design of new biocatalytic processes.
These include Lonza,         Merck &amp; Co, Evonik and DSM.
As an indication of the impact achieved         the Executive Director of BioProcess Technology &amp; Expression from         Merck &amp; Co has reported a 3-to-5-fold throughput improvement             by the application of microscale-based techniques.
This         accelerated the pipeline in multiple ways including: shortening the         duration from catalyst screen to delivery of mg quantities of initial         material by 70%, thereby enabling a 3-fold increase in the number of         projects that can be handled by a single scientist and widening of the         catalyst library that can be rapidly screened by 3 to 5 times [d].
This         enables them to complete customer projects in a shorter time or with the         commitment of fewer FTEs due to the parallel nature of the HEL miniature         bioreactor systems.
In addition UCL staff are now providing consultancy         services to additional companies on how to implement these         methodologies.
Economic benefits from screening and utilisation of BiCE enzyme           libraries: Libraries of engineered enzymes have been provided       to company partners for use in their internal high-throughput screening       programmes.
Licensing of these libraries saves each company the time and       costs involved in in-house library generation e.g.
for a company to       construct and validate an enzyme library containing tens to hundreds of       mutants, rather than using UCL's libraries, might demand full-time       commitment of 2 FTE for 6 months.
For example, Almac has used over 100 of       these enzymes to identify transaminases that are able to catalyse       amination of the substrates Almac uses in its in-house drug discovery       programmes and for customer contracts.
In 2010 Almac identified one TAm       variant that catalyses amine formation on a compound for a pharmaceutical       company customer.
They are now scaling up production of this TAm ready for       commercial-scale utilisation.
The head of biocatalysis at Almac said: "The         new enzyme process is one third of the cost of the chemical           process and the yield of the process has           increased from 10% to over 90%" [e].
Since then, Almac       and UCL have had a royalty-sharing agreement for the commercial       exploitation of this and the other transaminases.
In a similar vein,       Sigma-Aldrich has since 2006 used one of the BiCE TK variants for       commercial preparation of D-xylulose-5-phosphate and a TAm variant to       prepare pyridoxamine-5-phosphate.
The Head of Research Specialities from       Sigma-Aldrich (SIAL) notes that "The direct comparison of selective         one-step enzymic reactions to chemical routes of synthesis show the         advantage of replacing non-selective chemical routes, which then involve         also significant purification efforts after the reaction(s).
The         beneficial effect on safety, health and environment improvement by the         enzymatic route fits well with the current sustainability goals at         Sigma-Aldrich."
[f]     Environmental benefits arising from adoption of biocatalysis:       It is widely recognised in the chemical industry that biocatalysis       generates environmental benefits when used to replace chemical approaches       that require multiple steps and the use of protection/deprotection       reagents.
Industrial adoption of BiCE enzyme variants for commercial       production of chemicals and pharmaceutical intermediates, as described       above, has major environmental benefits.
For example, Almac's head of       biocatalysis noted: "Recent success using a BiCE transaminase enzyme         has resulted in the removal of 8 steps of chemistry using a transaminase         enzyme from the BiCE project.
As you can imagine this has a major input         into cost of goods by lowering reagent and energy usage and very         importantly, waste production" [f].
Likewise, SIAL has obtained       similar benefits since 2008 through exploitation of a BiCE TK enzyme for       the synthesis of xylulose-5-phosphate and a transaminase single step route       to pyridoxamine-5`-phosphate, both metabolic intermediates useful for       research purposes.
These enzyme processes replace multiple chemical steps       in the synthesis of these products, with the benefit that no costly and       hard-to-dispose-of organic solvents need to be used [f].
New job creation: The establishment of Synthace in 2011 and       its subsequent success in raising investment funding has led directly to       the creation of 7 new jobs [b].
Likewise, Almac's association with UCL and       adoption of our advanced biocatalyst technologies "has resulted in         significant growth of biocatalysis research at Almac including increased         staff numbers" [f].
In a new business plan finalised in July 2013       HEL Ltd committed to the creation of 4 new jobs to support their growing       miniature stirred bioreactor product line [d].
Knowledge transfer to the wider industrial community: The       wider uptake of BiCE programme outputs has also been achieved through       incorporation of BiCE-related material in a number of the industrial       modules contributing to the UCL MBI&#174; Training         Programme.
Modules using this material include Rapid Fermentation       Process Development, Design of Experiments for Bioprocess Optimisation and       Industrial Biocatalysis and Biorefining.
These modules have been attended       by 157 industrial delegates from over 50 companies since 2008, with       several customers having used multiple courses throughout the five-year       period covered.
