     STRAW-I, developed by Prof Wydell, is the first and only systematic and       comprehensive tool for diagnosing children (8-12 years old) with dyslexia       across primary schools in Japan.
The test also identifies areas of       cognitive deficit (e.g., visuo-spatial processing deficits, short-time       memory deficits, etc.
), enabling appropriate intervention programmes       tailored for each dyslexic child's need.
STRAW-I, supported by the research findings that 1.5% and 6.8% of       Japanese primary school children had reading problems with syllabic Kana       and logographic Kanji respectively, has informed the public, educational       sector and health professionals of the existence of dyslexia among       Japanese children who were otherwise labelled as `lazy', and consequently       became `drop-outs'.
The influence on the education and health sectors are evident from its       sales statistics.
According to Interuna, the publisher of STRAW-I, over       4,700 copies of the 2nd edition of STRAW were purchased since       its publication in 2008 in addition to 4,000 copies of the 1st       edition in 2006-2007.
Given that STRAW-I can be purchased by an       organisation only, this confirms that over 8,700 organisations have been       using STRAW-I as their standard test.
Copies were sold to educational       authorities, primary schools, schools for special needs education, local       children's welfare centres, hospitals, clinics, and universities,       indicating wide usage by educationalists, researchers, clinicians, and       psychologists across Japan.
It has been used in every city across Japan.
In response to high demands, the publisher plans to produce 5,000 copies       of STRAW-II (which incorporates STRAW-I and an added test for elder       children) by 2013.
As reflected by a wide range of institutions using STRAW-I, it is a fully       comprehensive and versatile tool.
A primary school teacher, who is also a       member of the Educational Board and the Special Needs Education Committee       in Yachiyo-shi (city) confirmed that STRAW-I has been standardised for       Grades 2-6 (8-12 years old) in schools and that it has been `extremely       welcomed' by educational practitioners to identify areas of improvement       once children are assessed with their reading, writing and cognitive       development levels.
[S3]     Another teacher from Kashiwa-shi Kashiwa Dai-san Primary School also       noted STRAW's wide applicability [S4]:     `STRAW is useful to identify those children whose IQ (Intelligence         quotient) scores are well within the normal range and yet who have         reading/writing difficulties.
It is also useful to identify the literacy         attainment level of these children, as the data are standardised across         the grades.
Testing children with the STRAW is not taxing to them.'
STRAW-I has been used to understand the effectiveness of the intervention       programme to improve children's reading and writing levels.
A primary       school teacher from Funabashi-shiritsu Misaki Primary School, who is also       in charge of children with special needs, noted [S5]:     `Even when we knew through observations some children were struggling         with reading/writing, until STRAW, there was no test to quantify         statistically the levels of their difficulties...the test is also very         useful to monitor how effective the remediation programmes are when         offered for these children.'
Major dyslexia clinics such as Kanagawa Prefectural Children's Medical       Center and Tottori Rehabilitation Centre for Children with Disabilities       reported that referrals of children with suspected dyslexia by their       schools increased significantly since the publication of STRAW-I.
Previously children referred to these clinics tended to be diagnosed with       other developmental disorders such as ADHD, autism, etc.
However, STRAW-I       has now made it possible to clearly identify those children specifically       with developmental dyslexia.
A paediatrician at Goshikidai Hospital in Kagawa also noted that STRAW-I         is `superior to other tests since Japanese children's literacy         development/attainment can be objectively assessed based on large scale         research data.
The children's literacy attainment is measured by the         accuracy of their test (STRAW) performance.'
[S6]     A paediatric neurologist, who works at 4 different hospitals, including a       medical welfare centre, in Tottori, noted the effectiveness of STRAW:     `STRAW is the only standardised test in Japan which can evaluate         children's writing attainment, and I use STRAW when assessing children         with dysgraphia.
STRAW can also evaluate children's attainment levels in         reading/writing in Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji &#8212; it is easier to see         where the children's problems arise.'
