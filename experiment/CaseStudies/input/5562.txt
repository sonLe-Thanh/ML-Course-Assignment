     Weizman's analyses are widely cited in political and human rights       contexts.
Data for the original map was available online (see reference 2       above) and spurred the creation of a plethora of maps custom- made by       advocacy groups, NGOs and human rights organisations.
Weizman's research       is referred to by almost all studies on planning and human rights in       Palestine.
[1]     Hollow Land has been extremely influential among those engaging       with the politics of architecture and has been widely reviewed in the       mainstream press, and in special documentary programmes in Israel, Germany       and the Netherlands.
[2] The `Mengele's Skull'       project was disseminated to a wider public through an exhibition in the       Portikus Gallery in Frankfurt in 2012 and in an article in a special issue       of Cabinet Magazine on Forensics, edited by Eyal Weizman;[3]       this quarterly arts and culture journal is intended as a sourcebook of       ideas for an eclectic international audience of readers, from artists and       designers to scientists, philosophers, and historians.
Weizman is       currently working with Al Jazeera English on a 30 minute documentary about       forensic architecture, to be aired in March 2014.
The research has been drawn upon in various legal processes including the       2004 International Court of Justice ruling on the "separation fence", and       in UN statements including the 2013 UN HRC Fact Finding Mission on the       settlements.
[4] Weizman's expertise was reflected in his       invitation to advise the Palestinian Ministry of Planning in Ramallah on       the reuse of the evacuated settlements in the occupied territories.
[5]     Findings and reports from the Forensic Architecture project have focused       media attention on human rights violations, and have influenced political       and legal responses to them.
For example:             Death of Bassem Ibrahim Abu Rahma (17/04/09):[6]         the research team examined the events which led to this protester being         struck and killed by a tear gas grenade in Bi'lin, Palestine.
The report         led to the opening of a special military investigation of this case, and         the trial of one of the perpetrators.
The case was reported in one of         Israel's main TV channels        Use of drones in counter-terrorism:[7] On         24/01/13, the UN Special Rapporteur on Counter Terrorism and HR launched         an inquiry into the civilian impact and human rights implications of         drone use and invited input from the Forensic Architecture team.
The         resulting research has been reviewed in several media outlets and was         presented to the UN General Assembly in October 2013.
Use of airburst white phosphorus munitions in densely populated           areas:[8] With Human Rights Watch [HRW],         Weizman's team researched the use of white phosphorus chemical weapons         by the Israel Defence Forces and the US military.
In November 2012 the         findings were presented to the Human Rights council in Geneva, in the         context of a HRW event on incendiary weapons during the meeting of the         Convention on Conventional Weapons States Parties.
The Forensic         Architecture report formed part of a petition to Israel's High Court of         Justice calling for the prohibition of the use of these munitions in         urban environments.
The case was won.
Weizman has delivered many keynote speeches, memorial lectures, and       special addresses outside the academic context.
These have included the       4th Nelson Mandela Lecture in 2012 "Walls and wars, rights and ruins:         The revelations of forensic architecture" at the Bob Hawke Prime       Ministerial Centre in Adelaide, Australia, to an audience of lawmakers,       politicians, academics and the general public.
[9]       Subsequent to that, he met and advised policy makers in Australia on       issues of space and human rights.
[10]     More generally, his work has created a `spatial turn' in the approach to       human rights violations around the world, spurring the production and       distribution of maps by a range of political groups, NGOs and human rights       organisations.
[11]     It has been similarly influential in the context of architecture and art,       with his work featuring in exhibitions around the world.
His early       research on the occupied territories led to exhibitions at the Storefront       Gallery for Art and Architecture in New York and a major exhibition       preceding the present REF period, in 2003 [Territories, at Berlin's       KW Institute for Contemporary Arts] which was later shown in Rotterdam,       Berkley, Malm&#246;, Tel Aviv and Ramallah, accompanied by lectures to       specialist and general audiences.
Since 2008 it has been shown in the       Bozar Expo in Brussels, NGBK in Berlin, the Istanbul Biennial, Home Works       in Beirut, Tate Modern in London, the Oslo Triennial, Nottingham       Contemporary, the James Gallery at CUNY, the Tate gallery in London, The       Sharjah Biennale, the Centre Pompidou in Paris and many other places.
[12]       These exhibitions have shaped the debate on the use of architectural       analysis in human rights, and have had a significant impact in the fields       of architecture, art and human rights, as evidenced by his award of the       2010 Prince Claus Prize for Architecture[13] and the       selection of his work by Art Forum as one of the `top ten cultural       projects of the decade'.
[14]     Major exhibitions of the forensic architecture research are planned for       the House of World Culture (HKW) in Berlin, Portikus Gallery in Frankfurt       and Le Bal in Paris.
In June 2013 Weizman signed an agreement with HKW to       present the research in a major exhibition with funding of &#8364;450K from the       hauptstadtkulturfonds (Capital         Cultural Fund).
These exhibitions testify to the cross-disciplinary       reach of his work which links, innovatively and fundamentally, the fields       of human rights, architecture, and art.
