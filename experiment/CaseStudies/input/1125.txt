     1) Assessment of potential EU harmonisation of corporation taxes       The European Commission has for many years been considering its Common       Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) proposal for establishing a form       of harmonisation of corporation tax within the EU.
In 2008, the Commission       asked the CBT to undertake research to analyse the likely impact if such a       proposal were implemented.
The European Commission official currently in       charge of this work commented: "Michael [Devereux] is accepted as a       leading professional in taxation matters and the practical advantage of       having his participation and name on a study will lend a lot of       credibility to the analysis...he is also very objective."
[C2].
The work for this evaluation was published in a report, which is       summarised in Devereux's Economic Policy paper [R1].
The       aim of the study was to evaluate the likely impact on the European economy       and on individual member states.
As noted above, this involved the       construction of a detailed model of the European economy, combined with       detailed modelling of the international corporation tax system.
The       results of the study suggested that the economic benefits of introducing       the harmonised system are likely to be small.
Both in developing the study, and following the submission of an initial       draft to the Commission, the researchers worked closely and       collaboratively with officials of the European Commission.
For example,       officials asked for a number of additional scenarios to be considered,       including a more detailed examination of compliance costs, and these were       included in the final report.
However, the broad conclusions did not       change.
This evidence that the reform would not have a significant impact on the       European economy had a direct and indirect impact on the subsequent       decision made by the Commission to delay making a formal proposal for two       years.
The indirect impact arose through the fact that the report was       influential in shaping the negative response of many EU countries to the       proposal, including the UK and Ireland.
During this period of delay, the       Commission undertook a considerable amount of further work on the       proposal, and produced its own impact assessment in 2011 [C1],       which extensively quoted the results of the initial study [R1],       and also cited several other research contributions by Michael Devereux,       including [R4].
2) Implementation of reform to Portuguese VAT       In 2011, thanks to an awareness of her research on VAT within the       Portuguese Government, Rita de la Feria was appointed Adviser to the       Portuguese Government on VAT Policy.
This was in the context of the terms       of the International Monetary Fund / European Central Bank / European       Commission (the so-called troika) May 2011 bail-out agreement, in       which Portugal was required to perform an extensive reform of its VAT       system.
De la Feria was given responsibility for ensuring that the VAT       reforms were in line with the terms of the bail-out agreement, as well as       with best international practice in this area.
She provided extensive       advice, based on her research, for two State Budgets, in 2012 and 2013,       working closely with Portuguese government officials [C8].
The VAT reform, guided by de la Feria's research, had two main       objectives: fiscal consolidation, by increasing revenue accrued from the       tax; and promoting economic growth by making the tax more efficient.
Prior       to the reform, the Portuguese VAT system was extremely inefficient, as       measured by the OECD and IMF.
This reflected two basic problems with the       design of the tax: a narrow tax base (limited by exemptions and extensive       use of reduced rates), and high levels of fraud and avoidance.
The reform       therefore also had to address these two features.
As noted above, the       first of these issues in particular has been addressed in detail in de la       Feria's research [R4, R5, R6].
The 2012 Budget was primarily concerned with base broadening, as well as       anti-fraud and antiavoidance measures.
Based on her research over the       previous decade, largely set out in [R5], de la Feria devised a       set of criteria for broadening the base of VAT that took into account       various challenges, in particular limitations under European law, and the       potential impact of measures on low-income households, employment and       economic growth.
Apart from a small number of political concessions, de la       Feria's recommendations were applied and entered into force on 1 January       2012 [C8].
The Deputy Director of the IMF Fiscal Affairs       Department, commented that "together these measures resulted in a big       reduction in the goods and services with a reduced rate of VAT".
As a result of these changes, Portugal experienced a very significant       improvement in VAT efficiency, estimated at 30 points, whilst       substantially increasing revenues and generating savings of 1.2 per cent       of GDP [C6].
The EU Commission commented: "overall, the measures       will help to significantly increase VAT efficiency", (European Commission,       2012) [C5].
Other impacts:       CBT research has had a significant impact on several other areas of debate       and reform, including: the following:            The CBT Director of Legal Research, Judith Freedman, has pioneered         research into the effects of a General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR).
Based         on her research, she was appointed a member of an independent panel set         up by the UK government to investigate introducing a GAAR in the UK.
The         panel's recommendations were broadly accepted, and a GAAR was introduced         in the 2013 Budget.
This case is submitted to the Law Panel.
CBT researchers John Vella and Anzhela Yevgenyeva made influential         contributions on the proposal by the European Commission to introduce a         new Financial Transactions Tax.
Among other things, their research         questioned the legality of the procedure of "enhanced cooperation" by a         subset of member states; this was influential in the UK government's         decision to challenge the proposal at the European Court of Justice [C9].
The OECD invited the Michael Devereux to undertake a project on         transparency of reporting by multinational companies, chairing a group         of representatives of business, NGOs, the OECD and other academics.
This         research was influential in the OECD's decision not to pursue greater         transparency [C10].
Based on his research, Michael Devereux was appointed specialist         adviser to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee for its 2013         enquiry in corporation tax [C11].
CBT researchers have also         frequently provided oral and written evidence to select committees.
