     Impacts include: health and welfare, practitioners and services, public       policy Main beneficiaries include: patients, practitioners, international       policy makers     Our findings on EP/EMA and TE/TP were presented at national,       international meetings and published as above.
Our colleagues in       Sheffield, various medical groups around the world and associated       organisations (International Society for the Study of Trophoblastic       Disease [ISSTD], European Organisation for the Treatment of Trophoblastic       Disease [EOTTD], Federation Internationale for Gynaecolgic Oncology       [FIGO]) benefitted from this research, started to use and/or recommend the       regimens and they are now widely but not solely employed to treat women       who relapse following EMA/CO chemotherapy.
Moreover, colleagues in other       countries have started to publish with these regimens.
In the UK these       therapies have been used to treat about 50 women since 2008.
World-wide we       estimate several hundred women have received EP/EMA or TE/TP since 2008.
Most of these women will likely have been saved as a consequence.
The regimens are now recommended in the following guidelines: the Royal       College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 2010 [1; see pages 6 and 7],       the Dutch guidelines 2010 [2], International Society for the Study of       Gestational Trophoblastic Disease 2012 [3], and the Australian 2009       guidelines [4].
The results of our work (research reference 3) were presented at national       and international meetings.
The concept of a merged low and middle risk       group was adopted by the FIGO committee and went into the new FIGO scoring       system used in national and international guidelines published since 2008       [5].
The step wise use of either another single agent actinomycin D or the       introduction of combination agent chemotherapy (EMA/CO) depending on the       level of hCG at the point of resistance to methotrexate was adopted       initially in the other UK centre in Sheffield but then also in the       Netherlands [2], Australia [4], Lyon [6], and elsewhere.
In the UK this       policy has impacted on the management of about 130 women per year and lead       to a further refinement as the hCG cut-off was then increased to 300 IU/L       and following a recent audit in which overall cure rates are still running       at 100% we will likely increase the cut-off to 1000 IU/L.
With the present       hCG cut-off, we have saved about 15 women per year in the UK from more       toxic combination agent chemotherapy.
If this is replicated across the       world we will spare about 1700 women per year from unnecessary toxicity.
A       further increase in the hCG cut-off to 1000IU/L will potentially spare 30       women per yr in the UK from combination agent chemotherapy.
The latter has       not only short-term side-effects such as hair loss, increased risk of       infections and lethargy but in the longer term brings forwards the date of       the menopause by 3 years and can minimise the incidence of second cancers       in later life [3].
Our on-going research and large national experience has enabled us to       play a leading role in teaching practitioners how to manage GTD [3].
The       Charing Cross GTD centre (Seckl, Newlands) have been heavily engaged in       both international organisations (ISSTD and EOTTD) [3, 7].
We have       encouraged approximately 40 exchange visits since 2008 with medical teams       from various hospitals around the world which has helped to stimulate the       development of new centres in these countries.
We continue to advise the       centre on how to manage difficult cases, they have adopted our new       treatments and we provide them with genetic diagnostic support [8].
Moreover, after 2008 and visits to our centre from a group in Geneva, a       new Swiss GTD centre has been established in Jan 2009 [9].
Our impact is       therefore not just through development of new treatments but through       education events and hosting of international visitors in our centre       and/or visits to other centres to share best practice.
