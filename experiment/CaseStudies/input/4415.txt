     Aspects of Chinn's public engagement activity are core to his research       methodology and in that       way cultivate impact with/upon those individuals and communities with whom       he interacts to       produce his research.
In 2013, Chinn was honoured to receive the Award of       Master of the       University from the Open University in recognition of his notable       contribution to public service,       education and culture in the West Midlands, including his work in engaging       the public with their       local history (described below).
One of the key ways by which Chinn's research has had demonstrable impact       is through the       creation of the BirminghamLives Archive, comprised of public donations of       historical material [see       source 1 below].
Prior to the REF assessment period, in 2002 in       recognition of the importance of       this innovative collection, the Birmingham Grid for Learning set up a       dedicated website       (BirminghamLives) to make the archive accessible to the public.
The       website contains over 40,000       items (although more than twice this number exists in the original       archive, and has continued to       grow throughout the period 2008 - 2013), including letters, life stories,       interviews, cine film clips,       photos and a wealth of memorabilia.
Together they make up one of the       biggest collections of       working-class life history for any one place in the world, bringing to       light the everyday lives of the       many Birmingham people that have been mostly overlooked by historians.
The       Head of Collections       Development makes it clear that `the collection provides a large and       extremely rich source for the       history of urban working-class life from the late nineteenth century and       twentieth century.
The       depth of material relating to history of women is particularly valuable,       as is the rare material relating       to the experiences of immigrant and minority ethnic communities such as       those from the Italian,       Jewish and South Asian communities.
The archive also, of course, provides       a unique reflection of       Carl's vision as an academic public historian who realised the importance       of reaching out and       exchanging knowledge beyond the academy long before that became a       recognised or common       practice' [2].
Without Chinn's research, these resources would not have       been collected or       subsequently made available for use in the ways detailed below.
Chinn's research has concentrated upon those who have often been excluded       from or       marginalised by formal history: the working class, especially the poor;       women; and ethnic       minorities &#8212; with a particular focus on Birmingham and the surrounding       areas.
Through his work on       the history of local communities, Chinn has both enhanced people's         understanding of their         place in local history and facilitated their contribution to it.
As       a result of employing the       methodology in the production of the above outputs, Chinn relies on the       letters, poems, life stories,       creative writing, photographs, paintings, drawings, recordings or videos       of `ordinary' individuals for       his research donated by individuals from Birmingham from across the world       and these both       contribute to Chinn's research and demonstrate the public's engagement       with it.
The vast quantity       of donations have come as a result of Chinn's high profile as Birmingham's       Community Historian in       the period 2008 - 2013: in addition to academic papers and popular works       of history, Chinn       engages the community through weekly local history features in local       newspapers the Birmingham         Mail (circulation 48,660 &#8212; this weekly column in particular is a       crucial feature of Chinn's       engagement), Express and Star (circulation 116,992, with       estimated readership at 290,000);       through a weekly radio show on BBC WM; and the publication of a monthly       magazine Brummagem       about local history and using the contributions of the public (circulation       3,000).
By drawing together the directly narrated experiences of local people,       Chinn's research, and the       archive in particular, acts to preserve and present the cultural         heritage contributing to the         process of memorialisation and reconciliation for all of its people.
In 2012, Chinn donated the       `Black Country Memories Collection' from the archive to the Black Country       Living Museum.
The       Senior Curator for the Museum identified Chinn's research (of which the       collection is a part) as       making `a significant contribution to understanding the human history of       the Black Country and to       capturing irreplaceable reminiscences from those who lived or are living       here' [3].
The archive has stimulated interest in local histories.
Chinn receives an       average of 65 emails per       day, which include not only donations to the archive, but requests for       assistance and input into       local and personal histories (about a third of the total).
Chinn's       democratisation of local history       through his research and subsequent public engagement activities has resulted         in the         publication of countless local histories of the area (Chinn has       written forewords for at least 60       books of local history - 23 since 2008 - as well as inspiring and       supporting the production of       countless others) and the production of local history websites, also aimed       at engaging the public       [4].
The archive is also vital resource for amateur and professional         historians alike, providing as       it does a vast collection of sources online.
Chinn's research has also benefitted schools, providing free KS1 and         KS2 teaching ideas         based upon the sources within the archive [1].
What Chinn and the       archival team are keen to       emphasise through the provision of such resources is that an understanding       of the past can       provide vital continuity for young people living in a perpetually changing       world, giving them a sense       of place and belonging and an appreciation of the fact that the rights we       now enjoy were gained       through the hardships of those that came before.
In his talks to local       schools, Chinn creates       `intergenerational activity', by encouraging children to explore their       histories with family members.
Through working closely with local schools, Chinn has had an impact         upon the design and         delivery of their curriculum.
As a result of Chinn's influence, one       local school has set up their       own oral history website (2008) and in 2006 was invited to produce the       official Birmingham Air       Raids Remembrance Association website (which has had 630,000 hits to date,       the majority in the       period 2008 - 2013).
These both support their own delivery of the history       curriculum, but are also       available for other schools and groups to use for this purpose, as well as       accessible by the public       more widely.
A further specific example is that as a direct result of       Chinn's research and teaching,       Swanhurst school elected to teach Birmingham's local history at A-level,       with the focus on poverty       from 1834-1951 &#8212; Chinn's books feature on the reading list for this [5].
Chinn also works closely with the University of Birmingham Outreach       office, supporting events       aimed at local students from less advantaged backgrounds.
These events       include: giving annual       lectures (since 2009) for the History Quest Event (which forms part of the       Raising Aspirations in       Secondary Education Programme) for year 9 and 10 students from West       Midlands Schools (circa       250 children attend each event); giving lectures at the Academic       Enrichment Programme for       students in Year 12 (aimed at the brightest local students from less       advantaged backgrounds); and       in June 2012, giving a keynote at an event being driven by the Department       for Education (The       DUX) where the most gifted students in year 9 from across the country are       attending Russell       Group Universities for the day.
The event was attended by over 100       students and teachers from       around the UK.
The connection between Chinn's research and the impact of       these events is clear:       `Professor Chinn's interactive and inspirational lectures focus on the       importance that local History       plays in who we are and how the university is part of the students       community.
Feedback from       these sessions has always indicated that the session that Professor Chinn       delivers is amongst the       most valued by the students and teachers and using local history to         demonstrate his passion         about the importance that education plays, is a message that always       goes down extremely well'       (University of Birmingham Outreach Office) [6].
Chinn's particular focus on ethnic, religious and immigrant cultures and       communities has been       recognised throughout the region, and he has been called upon by a number       of charities and       associations to provide them with advice and historical context to         understand and respond         to the needs of their users and so influence their activities.
For       example, working with a Rights       and Equality group in Sandwell, Chinn was able to provide historical       information `on families of       both ethnic and indigenous people as well as their specific community       origins' which helped them       to `to resolve local issues and bring about good community cohesion'       (group Chief Executive)       [7].
He has also supported local groups representing the Irish, LBGT and       religious communities,       each of whom he was able to provide with tailored information on the       history of the area and       highlight `the importance of the positive contributions made by the       various communities that inhabit       our area... serving to promote and keep alive the pieces of history that       helped shape our       communities and point out the common ground we occupy though hardships       shared' (Manager,       Sandwell Irish Community Association) [8].
In summary, Chinn's research and promotion of community history in the       Birmingham area has       produced a wealth of new historical data, both directly (through the       BirminghamLives archive), but       also indirectly through encouraging and supporting the publication of       personal histories, websites       and archives which are freely available to the public.
The research has       resulted in a better       understanding of community relations (past and present) within the       Birmingham area, particularly       those for smaller and formerly marginalised communities.
Chinn's research       and commitment to       public engagement have also had an impact on the delivery and design of       local school curricula       and acted to highlight the opportunity of higher education to its pupils.
