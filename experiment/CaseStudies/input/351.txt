     Outputs have established guidelines and changed thinking at formative and       operational levels for conservation of iron within the heritage sector.
Introduced to the sector            Best practice guidelines for:                desiccated storage of chloride infested heritage iron         de-chlorination of archaeological iron              Corrosion control as a management concept for conservation       Quantitative research to underpin management and cost-benefit         analysis          Brunel's ss Great Britain - case history of research in practice            Provision of a predictive tool for managing the preservation of the         ship       Predictive survival to enable commercial and social exploitation of         ss Great Britain          Desiccated Storage     Evidence from Watkinson's research team has developed desiccated storage       into the first quantified evidence based method for preventing and       controlling the corrosion of archaeological publication and over 19       conferences (5.1) with citation in BS; PAS198:2011 `Specifications         for Environmental Conditions for Cultural Material' (5.2) and       collaboration with English Heritage producing `Guidelines for the         Storage and Display of Archaeological Metals' (5.3) which is       designed to guide end-users in decision making and best practice.
For the       first time evidence- based management of museum-based archaeological iron       is possible.
Impact in a broader context has also been pursued within       corrosion science arenas (5.4).
Managing preservation of vast collections of archaeological iron in       museums (5.5; 5.6) is challenging.
Outcomes from Cardiff research,       "have allowed end-users, including the British Museum, better to apply         evidence-based conservation treatment and management strategies to the         preservation of these vulnerable collections" (5.6).
The       Museum of London (5.5) notes how it, "enabled us to implement         and manage desiccated storage of tens of thousands of archaeological         iron objects with predictive understanding of its effectiveness and         outcomes."
Cardiff data on corrosion rates below 35% relative       humidity guides silica gel desiccant replacement strategies for the small       plastic boxes in which the bulk of archaeological iron is stored       worldwide, allowing managers to assess corrosion threats, determine risk       and "assess the most cost effective ways of maintaining our large         collections of this material by desiccated storage."
(5.5).
Thus time consuming renewal of gel in thousands of boxes can now be       planned according to the risk-level managers are prepared to adopt; either       no corrosion (frequent gel changes) or minor corrosion (changing gel       before box interiors reach corrosion escalating 35% relative humidity).
Similarly, for fully desiccated storerooms, relative humidity targets can       be set either to prevent or to control corrosion, according to what       constitutes acceptable cost.
Importantly, Cardiff research offers clear       guidelines on `safe' relative humidity values to guide end users to       calculate costs of storage with confidence (5.6).
Desalination     Quantification of desalination treatments and work on how they impact on       corrosion rate of iron post treatment offers data for users, "to decide         whether their use will offer cost benefit in terms of improved object         lifespan for the use of staff time and resources."
(5.5).
This links directly to management strategies developed by museum curators       to optimise resource use and forward plan (5.5).
Preservation of ss Great Britain     Cardiff research into low humidity corrosion "dramatically turned the         fortunes of the ship around and demonstrated that such large heritage         items can be conserved and preserved, as well as being brought to life         for the enjoyment and education of the general public" (5.7).
It facilitated cost- benefit analysis and offered a heritage management       tool for ss Great Britain (5.8).
It is recognised that, "delivering         an evidence based preservation strategy allows ss Great Britain to         predict the survival of the ship and develop a long-term business plan         with real confidence" (5.7).
By controlling corrosion with a       20% relative humidity operational target, rather than preventing it       occurring by implementing lower humidity controls, introduces the novel       and pragmatic concept of aligning object lifespan with resource       availability.
This offers a new management concept to conservation;       hitherto, corrosion prevention was inevitably the preservation goal.
It       also provides for flexible management, as when money is plentiful an       increased spend on fuel can reduce relative humidity in the controlled       space and lengthen the ship's lifespan, additionally any potential impact       of climatic control failure on corrosion rate can be predicted.
Survival of the ss Great Britain produces considerable social and       economic benefits for the city of Bristol.
The ship is the number one       visitor attraction there thanks to the "innovative conservation project         built upon the principles and parameters developed by Cardiff"(5.7)       The Trust turns over &#163;4m p.a., contributes &#163;9m p.a.
to the Bristol       economy, and is a major employer (172 posts) (5.7).
Pre-conservation visitors numbered 70,000 per annum (2004) compared to       170,000 (2010) with 15,000 plus venue hire guests (2010) and many school       visits (5.7).
The intangible impact of `sensation and visitor       experience' is reflected by visitor reviews, and this is only made       possible by the on-going and displayed conservation process (5.7; 5.9).
Tourism brings in 52% of visitors from outside the region, with 48% of       these in hotel accommodation.
Calculable survival of the ship acted as a       focus for the creation of the Brunel Centre in 2010 (5.10; 5.7),       which houses a conference centre, display area and a Brunel archive for       records from Bristol University, with apartments above providing added       income.
These achievements are recognised by many national and       international awards since 2006, which have only been made possible by       successful conservation of the ship (5.7).
Engineering applications for the corrosion data have been sought via       collaboration with Flint Neil Engineers, with access to examine historic       and modern bridges being planned, starting with Brunel's Clifton       Suspension Bridge to determine if corrosion products there reflect a       chloride driven corrosion mechanism.
A successful AHRC/EPSRC Science and       Heritage grant application (&#163;367,000) by Watkinson is refining and       extending the existing predictive preservation model developed in Cardiff       by quantifying real time corrosion of archaeological iron as a function of       humidity, chloride content and corrosion damage to objects measured as       iron loss and heritage value.
Cardiff University was approached by       Historic Scotland to determine best practice for the preservation of       historic wrought iron and has two PhD projects (one AHRC and one Historic       Scotland funded) working to this end.
