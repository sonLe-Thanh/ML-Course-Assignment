     Impacts include: health and welfare, practitioners and services       Main beneficiaries include: patients, health professionals, NHS,       international healthcare providers, WHO, hospital trusts and providers     The WHO Checklist is the single most widely utilised and known patient       safety intervention to be deployed within surgical care since patient       safety became an international priority a decade ago.
Following the       findings of the first global health study of the implementation of the WHO       surgical safety checklist, the NHS National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA)       mandated a modified version of the WHO Checklist for use in all surgical       procedures in England, including day surgery in January 2009 [1].
The       Checklist is now part of standard and mandatory operating theatre       procedures in this country.
Its direct impact on patient care is enormous:       it reaches 4.6 million surgical patients undergoing an operation annually       in England alone [2].
Further, there are an estimated 234.2 million       surgical patients worldwide [3], many of whom are positively affected by       the Checklist which as of March 2013 is actively used in 1790 healthcare       organisations worldwide [4].
To promote the Checklist across the NHS, the NPSA launched a major       implementation campaign known as `Patient Safety First' [5] to improve the       safety of patients in the NHS.
In 2009, our research group undertook the       national `Surgical Checklist Implementation Project' (SCIP [6]).
Funded by       the NIHR and led jointly by Professors Darzi (surgery) and Vincent       (safety), this project brought together surgeons and psychologists aiming       to scientifically study the implementation process of the Checklist across       the NHS, understand its impact on healthcare providers' use of the       Checklist, and derive lessons for the future.
SCIP involved longitudinal data collection over 18 months (2010-11)       across 19 hospitals in England (stratified for location, size, and       teaching vs. community status), surveying more than 3000 NHS personnel,       including observations of over 500 full surgical procedures, and       collecting outcome data from more than 6500 patients [6].
The project data       is currently being prepared for dissemination.
The following findings have       emerged:            Attitudes towards the Checklist in English hospitals have steadily         improved over time.
By the study end (Sept 2011), 74% of operating         theatre staff said they wanted to use the Checklist, 72% believed that         the Checklist makes surgical care safer, and 67% believed that it         improves information transfer in operating theatres.
The Checklist was used in over 96% of operations.
When the Checklist         was not used (particularly its final `Sign-out' part, at the end of a         procedure) there was a trend for increased post-operative complications.
Teamwork and compliance with standard processes of care (including         antibiotic prophylaxis and patient warming) are significantly higher in         teams who apply the Checklist fully (i.e., all items), who have all team         members present for the Checklist, where all team members pause and,         finally, where surgeons lead the Checklist application.
A systematic review we carried out as part of SCIP has provided         evidence that use of the Checklist improves teamwork and communication         in the operating theatre when used appropriately without team resistance         [7].
Following SCIP, Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust launched a one-year       (2011-12) surgical team training project, led by our research group and       aimed to improve use of the WHO Checklist across our Trust's three       hospitals.
The project culminated in modifications to the Checklist (which       were encouraged by its original developers) proposed and led by our       Trust's personnel &#8212; the modified Checklist was rolled out to the entire       Trust's surgical services in 2013.
Further, local `champions' of surgical       safety have been appointed and regular Checklist audits are now in place.
Our group's research on team working and safety in surgery has been       highlighted twice as research with significant societal impact in the UK       by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC).
In 2009, our research       on simulation-based training for surgeons, which incorporates training in       the use of the checklist, was selected as an impact case study in the       ESRC's 2009-14 Strategic Plan [8].
In 2011, our research on assessing team       working skills in operating theatres was selected as a case study for       societal impact that highlights the `human element of surgery'.
