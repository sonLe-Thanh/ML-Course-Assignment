     Advances in kimberlite volcanology and research findings (in particular [1];         [c]) have been taken on board by internationally renowned diamond       mining and consultancy companies, such as De Beers and SRK Consulting, to       directly inform internal decisions.
This has resulted in (i) the reduction       of financial risk, and (ii) the alteration of sampling strategies and       policies [b,c,d].
Consequently, the diamond industry has benefited       economically, commercially and strategically from the wealth of expertise       provided by Bristol [b-e], which has also brought about a much       needed and fundamental relook at kimberlite volcanology [d].
Local impact within De Beers:     The general success of the Bristol-De Beers initiative (2004) has led to       direct interventions to alter project plans and objectives within the De       Beers group of Companies [b]: "The fact that volcanological         data are now collected on a routine basis across the Group and all the         REP's is testimony to the success of this interaction and the         incorporation of this philosophy" [c].
In addition, "A         further area of significant impact was with regards to training offered         by Sparks to De Beers geologists in the form of a volcanic masterclass         and participation on an annual Santorini field trip.
Prior to this, the         skill levels on some De Beers operations were not very high, but since         being involved with Bristol there has been some improvement in this         regard" [c].
De Beers have further acknowledged that these       interactions significantly raised the levels of geological work conducted       at their operations and the overall quality of the geologists who now work       at those operations [b].
Consequently, this provision of training       and consultancy has led to new and improved processes being adopted on       projects.
De Beers has witnessed the impact of the Bristol research in (i)       the improvement of geological models; "The introduction of         quantitative data collection techniques have also had significant impact         on the construction of geological models by the Company's geologists,         which also benefitted greatly from interactions with the Bristol team.
This benefit is difficult to quantify in financial terms, but again can         be treated as a significant risk mitigation initiative" [e],       and (ii) changes in diamond sampling methods; "our understanding of         the geological complexities of many of the kimberlites we were mining         and evaluating improved considerably...this lent considerable support to         a change in the way in which we sample kimberlites for grade estimation"       [e].
Both of these factors have led to the mitigation of potential       future losses in the form of a decreased risk of failure of a resource       model; "Typically such commercial resource models can be valued at         between &#163;10s to 100's of millions of pounds, and the result of the         Bristol-De Beers initiative has reduced the risk of such failures         through the adoption of new strategies and protocols.
These previously         occurred due to an incorrect interpretation arising from a poor         understanding of the geology" [c].
International Impact on Diamond Mining:     Whilst it is difficult to quantify precisely how the kimberlite research       initiative has contributed in monetary terms to the international diamond       industry, "there are a number of important changes that have happened         in the industry because of the contribution of Bristol University" [d].
One example is "the sampling programme for the world class Orapa         kimberlite mine was changed because of the geological mapping and         interpretation conducted by Bristol researchers (see the papers by         Gernon et al., 2009a,b) [sic [6]].
In the         strictest confidence I can confirm that this change in sampling strategy         has had a major positive influence on the life of this mine.
This mine         contributes roughly 10% of the world's annual diamond supply.
This         change will significantly increase that proportion" [b].
Furthermore, "Research conducted at Orapa mine by the Bristol team         showed the current reserve being mined may not continue below a certain         depth level, and therefore the sampling programme to evaluate the deeper         levels was tailored to ensure that significant diamonds are recovered         from the deeper regions to test whether the diamond grades and qualities         may have changed" [e].
A second example is that "Mapping         at Jwaneng Mine provided a clearer understanding of the geological         continuity of facies in this mine, and this provided confidence that         allowed management to approve changing the sampling methodology for         grade determination" [e].
Other contributions of Bristol research to the diamond mining industry       include; firstly, the re-evaluation of kimberlite terminology; "We have         since seen the nomenclature and data collection standards been         progressively updated and developed...to a much improved and better         communicated standard throughout the industry internationally.
The new         standards have been adopted by most kimberlite exploration and mining         companies...such as De Beers, BHP, Rio Tinto, Stornoway, Shore Gold and         Peregrine Diamonds" [d].
Secondly, a modern       re-interpretation of the volcanology processes that could form       kimberlites; "new or better understood processes have allowed         kimberlite geologists to improve the understanding and prediction of         diamond size and abundance variations within a deposit.
The new ideas         are being applied by the most knowledgeable kimberlite geologists who         develop diamond estimation models, such as SRK, Mineral Services and         other independent specialists" [d].
Lastly, the provision of       an updated emplacement model for kimberlites; "To a geologist         estimating the diamond distribution, these big-picture models improve         the prediction of the spatial compartmentalization of diamonds...Very         importantly, the models influence diamond sampling programs by guiding         the location and frequency of samples required...the improved kimberlite         models are therefore improving the quality of the classification of         diamond resource estimates internationally" [d].
As well as improving diamond sampling and increasing confidence in grade       estimations, research conducted by Bristol since 2004 has also highlighted       that "the local oversimplification of the geology and assumptions of         homogeneity in the estimation of diamond content may be causing an         over-estimation of the diamond content.
The correct understanding of the         pipe forming processes...forced SRK to reduce the confidence         classification for the deposit, and caused us to treat the samples         differently and raise the awareness that the diamond content may be as         much as 10-20 % less.
This caused the investing company to decide to         protect itself and not invest in the project" [d].
Conference presentations and published papers in leading journals [1-6]       have brought the Bristol group's work on kimberlites to the attention of       other workers in the field, which has led "immediately to similar         research initiatives sponsored by De Beers' main competitors in the         diamond market, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, being initiated.
As a         consequence knowledge of kimberlite geology went through a period of         rapid growth.
It is difficult to quantify how this may have affected the         industry as a whole, but in my opinion it probably has had a significant         improvement on how kimberlite ore bodies are now defined" [b].
This is further supported by [e]: "De Beers and its associated         companies benefitted greatly from this research collaboration.
I have no         doubt that other diamond exploration and mining companies would also         have benefitted from this as the methodologies and techniques introduced         by this research programme inevitably spread across the industry".
