     Philippe Marli&#232;re's research and analysis of the 2012 French presidential       election extended the range and improved the quality of evidence about       this important election, notably through his contributions to media       coverage of that election in Britain and France.
It provided the vital       contextualisation required for the British media &#8212; especially the BBC &#8212; to       present a more nuanced and informed picture of the changing French       political landscape in their coverage of the presidential election and, in       turn, helped to inform the British public of likely electoral and       political outcomes and the social and political contexts in which they       would occur.
In particular, his research facilitated an improved public       and media understanding of the role of third party candidates in both the       election itself and the political landscape thereafter.
Contributions to French coverage of the 2012 presidential election:       The first round of the presidential election was held in France on 22       April 2012.
Nicholas Sarkozy, the incumbent and leader of the centre-right       Union pour un mouvement populaire (UMP), sought re-election to a       second five-year term against a presidential challenge from Fran&#231;ois       Hollande of the increasingly centre-left Parti socialiste (PS).
The election was widely held to be a two-horse race between these       candidates, and was treated almost exclusively as such by the UK media.
However Marli&#232;re argued, on the basis of the research outlined above, that       Jean-Luc M&#233;lenchon (Left Front) and Marine Le Pen (National Front) would       also perform well.
In 2010-2011, he shared these insights with a broad       non-academic audience through a series of articles for Le Monde,       the world's principal French language daily with a circulation of some       340,000 copies per issue, 35,000 of which are distributed outside of       France [1].
In those articles, Marli&#232;re analysed M&#233;lenchon's potential to       be an important figure in the 2012 election, the PS's transformation into       a de-ideologised `catch-all' party, and the likelihood that the left would       defeat Sarkozy.
He also contributed regular blog posts to Mediapart, a       major left-leaning French journal.
These posts, which commented on the       French elections and were likewise informed by the research outlined above       typically attracted over 20 comments each, with analyses of M&#233;lenchon and       the socialist primaries garnering 118 and 154 respectively [2].
Transfer of expert knowledge informing British media coverage and UK       public understanding of the presidential election: In the British     press, M&#233;lenchon's campaign went virtually unreported until the Guardian's     publication in April 2012 of two lengthy opinion articles &#8212; one by Marli&#232;re,     the other by Seumas Milne.
Both argued that the popularity of M&#233;lenchon's     ideas and policies was attributable to the fact that no other major     candidate was engaging working-class voters.
Marli&#232;re further suggested that     although M&#233;lenchon's policy proposals might be described as `radical' they     were sufficiently coherent to be taken seriously [3].
Both articles, in a     newspaper with a print and online readership approaching 2m [3], received a     great deal of attention: Marli&#232;re's attracted 320 comments, and Milne's 562,     most of them sympathetic to this view.
The electronic version of Marli&#232;re's     article was tweeted over 200 times, and shared over 1,800 times on Facebook     [3].
Those impacts were compounded by Marli&#232;re's production of an election     diary, which appeared in 11 instalments between 23 April and 4 May 2012 on     OpenDemocracy, a leading UK news website with over 3.5m unique views per     year.
Here, Marli&#232;re used research findings to demonstrate the potential for     `small' candidates to capitalise on both negative factors (the unpopularity     of the main candidates and their very similar policy proposals) and positive     factors (good campaigning by the Left Front and an improved image for the     National Front) [5].
Recognising and seeking to redress the imbalance and gaps in its own       coverage, the BBC's Analysis and Research Unit invited Marli&#232;re to brief       journalists during the run-up to the election.
This off-the-record       briefing was delivered to some 50 journalists, anchors, UK and Europe       reporters, programme editors and researchers on 4 April 2012 at White City       Television Centre (London), a month before the first round of the       election.
It comprised a forty-minute talk providing context on developing       issues and contacts for further insights, followed by questions from the       floor.
Explaining that his analysis showed no strong political momentum       for the main candidates (Sarkozy, Hollande and Bayrou, a centrist),       Marli&#232;re predicted rises that both the left-wing candidate Jean-Luc       M&#233;lenchon and the extreme-right candidate Marine le Pen would rise in the       polls and eventually come in third and fourth position.
This intervention helped BBC journalists understand the major issues at       stake in the election and significantly increased the attention they paid       to the `smaller' candidates who, as Marli&#232;re predicted, did eventually       fare better than had been suggested by the media at the start of the       campaign [10].
The event organiser noted the very positive feedback from       journalists, who had found it `useful', `interesting', `relevant' and       `well-timed'.
Marli&#232;re himself received personal thanks from several       journalists, who said that they would take his advice on board when       reporting the election.
Indeed, such was its usefulness that the BBC used       the original briefing as the basis for its development of digitalised       resources for use by its journalist: thus the College of Journalism, which       oversees training for BBC editorial staff, filmed two clips for an       internal website accessible only to BBC journalists.
The briefing       organiser also made an audio recording and transcription of the session.
These valuable information and resources were subsequently accessed at       least 100 times by journalists working on the election [10].
Coverage of       the election on the BBC's website, which had previously almost entirely       excluded consideration of M&#233;lenchon's election prospects, showed a       markedly increased inclination after Marli&#232;re's briefing to provide much       fuller treatment [6].
Marli&#232;re's analysis proved accurate, and thus instrumental in ensuring       that BBC journalists covered the election fairly and accurately.
Le Pen       eventually received over 15% of the share of the votes nationally and came       third, while M&#233;lenchon received over 11%.
The value of the briefing to BBC journalists is further suggested by the       numerous requests for interviews and comment from Marli&#232;re.
Media       appearances during the election run-up included:     - BBC Radio 4 Westminster Hour, 22 April 2012.
On the 2012 French       presidential results (first round), reaching over 10.5 million (RAJAR all       regions, 3 months ending June 2012).
- BBC Radio 5, Breakfast Programme, 2 May and 7 May 2012.
On the       television debate between Nicolas Sarkozy and Fran&#231;ois Hollande, and on       the second round of the French presidential election, reaching over 6       million (RAJAR all regions, 3 months ending June 2012).
- BBC World, 6 May and 15 May 2012.
Special programme on the       election (including live coverage of election results), and contribution       to coverage of Hollande's inaugural ceremony (on air 9am-12.30pm): BBC       World TV attracts a global audience of 97m [7].
These led, in turn, led to appearances on other international news       outlets, notably including Sky (on `Adam Boulton and Co', 15 May 2012) and       the American public broadcaster NPR (on Background Briefing Production:       thirty-minute interviews on 23 April and 6 May 2012).
Meanwhile, M&#233;lenchon       himself was invited to a series of media appearances, reflecting the new       recognition in the UK of his role as a left-wing player in French       politics.
These included a video interview with the Guardian (416       viewer comments [8]), and interviews for the New Statesman and       OpenDemocracy.
Subsequent contributions to UK public understanding of the French         political landscape: The contribution made by the research to       enhancing UK public understanding of the French political landscape       continued even after the election ended.
On 6 December 2012, in       collaboration with the European Institute at UCL, Marli&#232;re invited       M&#233;lenchon to present his ideas as a prominent French politician to a mixed       audience of some 440 students, academics, ambassadors, politicians,       trade-unionists, journalists and members of the public.
Marli&#232;re was       responsible for deciding the terms of the event and, in his introduction,       presented an analysis of the role of left wing politics in France in       austerity Europe.
The event gave UK journalists and the public a rare       opportunity to hear at first hand the views of a French leftist       politician; the academic contextualisation of those views provided a       nuanced assessment of the French political landscape.
The event was extremely successful: though organised at short notice all       tickets, in three separate issues, sold out immediately.
In total 440       people attended, though emails received by the European Institute suggest       that as many as 650 ticket requests were made [11].
The benefits from this       presentation of information and analysis were maximised by its live       streaming, and the development of information and learning resources whose       online accessibility extended the reach of the original benefits to a much       wider public.
More than 2,500 viewers watched the live stream and the       video on UCL's Vimeo account showed it had been played over 7,000 times by       31 July 2013, including over 3,000 from Facebook alone [12].
Partly thanks       to the increased understanding of M&#233;lenchon's position among British media       professionals, the event was well attended by journalists, including       representatives from the Independent, Guardian, OpenDemocracy,       the New Statesman and the Morning Star.
Although       M&#233;lenchon's speech was delivered in French, OpenDemocracy recognised its       importance and had it transcribed and translated for its own website       (15/1/13); it also published an interview with the candidate (11/1/13), as       did the New Statesmen (12/12/12), the UK's biggest political       website, with over 1.1m unique users [13].
