     The culture of the Somalis is one in which oral poetry and song are       favoured forms of expression; indeed, the language was only first written       in an officially recognised script in 1972.
Virtually every town has its       bards and the making, copying, selling and exchange of cassettes and now       digital media featuring versions of the most popular poems.
Recitations       are an important aspect of daily life.
Both in the Somali territories and       in the diaspora, discussion of poetry and literary debate are regular       features of Somali language press and media.
The inherent challenges of the English translation of Somali poetry are       various &#8212; the need for a sophisticated command of both languages and an       understanding of subject matter drawn from a radically different culture,       a knowledge of the political and clan and sub-clan affiliations and       tensions that shape contemporary Somali life in addition to a       comprehension of the complex of formal characteristics and modalities that       condition Somali poetry.
Dr Orwin`s extensive research and fieldwork,       command of the Somali language, connections in Somali communities and       desire to create elegant, effectual works in English that move beyond       literal translations have made him, perhaps uniquely, capable of producing       such high-calibre, well-informed translations that have attracted the       interest and respect of Anglophone and Somali audiences alike.
Many of Dr Orwin`s translations of Somali poetry are freely available       from online resources.
His translations of nine Somali poems are on the       Poetry World Map (1 and 11, below), a project sponsored by City Lore, an       arts advocacy organisation in New York and partially funded by the US       National Endowment for the Arts.
A bilingual collection of poems and       stories dating from the colonial era to the Second World War, War and         Peace: An Anthology of Somali Literature, is downloadable from the       Progressio website (2).
The volume features Dr Orwin`s "Introduction to       the English Translations", highlighting the formal characteristics of       Somali poetry and translations done together by him and Somali poetry       connoisseur Maxamed Xasan `Alto`.
Alastair Whitson of the organisation       Progressio, said of War and Peace (10):     "War and Peace' was far more than just a poetry anthology.
Our work in         Somaliland involved supporting peace-building and strengthening civil         society in a post-conflict state.
The process of writing down and         collecting oral literature enabled participants to capture and reflect         on experiences of and strategies for peace-building in Somali society.
This process itself helped build social cohesion, while the publication         in a carefully edited and explicated edition served to celebrate the         resilience and potential togetherness of the people of Somaliland.
Significantly, the collaboration with co-publisher Red Sea Online         ensured the anthology reached a broad audience among the Somali         diaspora, who are the main supporters of nation-building and         peace-building in the territory of Somaliland.
The book's messages also         gain a regular local audience through Red Sea Online's support for the         annual Hargeisa Book Fair, which is seen as a significant socio-         cultural event in Somaliland and highlights the prominent role of         literature, and literary dialogue, in Somali society."
In the UK, eleven of Dr Orwin`s translations, resulting from       collaborations with Somali and Anglophone poets are available on the       Poetry Translation Centre website (3).
Dr Orwin`s work for the Poetry       Translation Centre in particular has successfully attracted the interest       of a larger community of interested translators and poets who have also       begun working to translate Somali poems into English.
Sarah Maguire of the       Poetry Translation Centre (PTC) (4):     "In 2008 Dr Orwin co-translated a further selection of Gaarriye's         poems with British poet W. N. Herbert, that was published as a         dual-language chapbook by the PTC.
Since then he has acted as an         invaluable consultant (...), a partnership that has led to the         translation and publication of the young woman poet, Caasha Lul Mohammad         Yusuf, and to translation and publication in book form of the greatest         living Somali poet, Maxamed Ibraahin Warsame 'Hadraawi', a world-class         poet who is revered by his people and who is known as the 'Somali         Shakespeare'.
Without Dr Orwin's contribution, the PTC would not be the success that         it is today.
In addition, through him, many non-Somali speakers have         been introduced to the brilliance of Somali poetry and countless Somalis         have been able to meet their most admired poets and read their poetry in         excellent English translation.
Few other academics working in the         humanities can have had such a broad-reaching, decisive impact on         communities beyond the academy."
Dissemination of Dr Orwin`s research and translations has been achieved       through participation in radio programmes and high-profile cultural events       and through extended interviews about his work on metre in Somali poetry       available on YouTube.
In 2010, Orwin joined host Rageh Omar and a London       Somali poet on The Bards of Somalia (5), a BBC 4 programme       broadcasted twice in August, a month with weekly listening figures of       10,368,000 (RAJAR) (6).
London-based poet Abdullahi Botan Hassan, with       Orwin`s help, made a translation of Shakespeare`s sonnet XII, which was       performed by Yusra Warsama at the Globe Theatre`s free multilingual event       `Sonnet Sunday` in which 154 Shakespearean sonnets were performed in more       than 20 languages.
For the 2012 Cultural Olympiad`s week-long `Poetry       Parnassus,` which featured a performance of a poem from each of the 204       Olympic nations, Orwin provided the translation of Central London,       a poem written and performed by (Abdullahi Botan) Hassan.
The same       translation was also printed on some of the 100,000 bookmarks dropped from       a helicopter on the Southbank at the start of the event, and is featured       in The World Record: International Voices from Southbank Centre's         Poetry Parnassus (7, 8).
An interview with a member of the       Somali community in London in which Orwin discusses his work has had more       than 10,000 views on YouTube since it was uploaded in January 2010 (9).
For more than 10 years Dr Orwin has also regularly contributed to a range       of cultural and educational events sponsored by members of the Somali       community in London and beyond.
This has included the largest annual       Somali community event in London, Somali Week, which showcases Somali       poetry, music and theatre.
At the 2012 event, for example, Orwin took part       in a panel discussion celebrating the 40th anniversary of the       official Somali writing system.
In collaboration with the Somali Youth       Development Resource Centre in Kentish Town and Soohan Arts, an       organisation working with schools in Camden, Orwin has delivered a number       of talks on poetry and Somali language (on one occasion even presenting       children with a Somali Language poem of his own).
In recognition of these       and other contributions, in 2010 Orwin was awarded the London Somali       Community`s Haya Prize for his Outstanding Contribution to the Somali       Language.
In all these activities, Orwin has endeavoured to communicate and promote       the positive elements of Somali culture &#8212; a culture cleaved and crushed by       war, famine and displacement on a massive scale &#8212; whose refugee       populations are often marginalised and even maligned in their new host       scountries.
It is in these endeavours, all too unique, that he has made a       difference to how Somalis are perceived by the wider world and encouraged       Somalis, and particularly those too often disaffected in the global       diaspora, to cherish their contributions to world literature.
