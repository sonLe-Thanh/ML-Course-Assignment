     From research to impact     XstalBio Ltd was formed as a spin-out company in 2004 to license,       commercialise, and extend the       intellectual property associated with the protein and vaccine       stabilisation technology.
XstalBio's       technology adds therapeutic value, accelerates the development, and       extends the life-cycles of       protein-based drugs as well as enabling new product opportunities.
The       company targets the       $50bn currently spent per annum by the pharmaceutical industry on       biopharmaceutical product       development.
XstalBio markets its expertise and technology to these pharma       companies with the       aim of enabling development of improved formulation and delivery methods       for new candidate       biologic drugs and vaccines.
In an internationally competitive market, XstalBio has succeeded in       selling contracts for access to       its Intellectual Property Portfolio for over 8 years and has continuously       developed the patented       technology to meet the new challenges facing the biopharmaceutical       industry.
These contracts,       worth &#163;2.2M over the period 2008-2012, are underpinned by option license       agreements taken out       on the WestCHEM owned patents.
An early client was Boehringer Ingelheim       who subsequently       licensed the stabilisation technology from XstalBio, primarily for       delivery of biologics by inhalation.
As part of this license agreement the two companies co-developed and built       a dedicated GMP       compliant pilot plant for inhalation dry powders, which was commissioned       in Biberach, Germany in       2008 at cost of &#8364;5M.
Development programmes have also been carried out with, or are on-going       with, other major       pharmaceutical companies including [text removed for publication] with       most contracts being with       biologic drug development groups from outside the UK.
The specific details       of these are subject to       stringent commercial confidentiality agreements but in general the role of       XstalBio is to accelerate       development, enhance therapeutic value, or manage the life-cycle of the       biopharmaceutical by       providing innovative dry powder formulations which improve the overall       product profile.
Type of Impact       An important impact of the original research has been economic with the       launch and growth of a       sustainable UK based SME with global reach in the pharmaceutical industry.
In the period 2008-2012,       the company made international sales of its Intellectual Property of &#163;2.2M       and employed 8       full-time research and development scientists at BSc and PhD level.
The       company has also       supported and trained 3 PhD CASE studentships based at WestCHEM and the       London School of       Pharmacy.
Vaccines and medicines based on biomolecules will be major engines of       growth in the       pharmaceutical industry over the coming decades.
The significant payments       by international       companies to XstalBio for access to its IP portfolio demonstrate that its       biologic formulation and       drug delivery technologies lie at the commercial cutting-edge and are       impacting on the direction       taken by top ten pharmaceutical companies in developing the next       generation of biologic       medicines.
Unmet product and process needs that XstalBio Technology is being used to       address include:            Delivery by inhalation with a dry powder inhaler requires sensitive         biologics to be processed         into particles in the size-range of 3-5 microns with no loss of tertiary         structure or bioactivity.
Techniques such as milling cannot be used and spray-drying produces         extremely moisture-sensitive         powders which require expensive protective packaging.
The impact of         XstalBio's         PCMC technology in this field was recognised by Boehringer Ingelheim and         resulted in a         licensing agreement and significant investment in a GMP compliant         manufacturing facility         (estimated &#8364;5M),       Shipping and storage of biomolecules without the need for continuous         refrigeration is a major         goal for organisations and companies that intend to supply diagnostics,         biological medicines         and vaccines in challenging environments such as remote regions in the         developing world.
XstalBio PCMC dry powders remain stable at high temperatures and in         humid conditions and         therefore offer considerable cost savings to its partners.
Boehringer         Ingelheim has noted these         more efficient and cost effective manufacturing opportunities compared         with conventional         methods:          "Particularly with regard to cost-effectiveness, precipitation methods         are attractive.
An         interesting method is the protein-coated microcrystals (PCMC) technology         that stabilises         biomolecules on crystalline surfaces by co-precipitation during rapid         solvent exchange"            Administration of therapeutic proteins at very high concentration by         subcutaneous delivery         would provide an alternative to lengthy infusions, reducing resource use         (time in clinic) and         improving quality of life for patients with chronic conditions.
As was         demonstrated with a Pfizer         candidate human monoclonal antibody, the patented stabilising additives         prevent aggregation         and conserve bioactivity.
Because the dry mAb powders can also be         rapidly reconstituted to         very high protein concentration (&gt;200mg/ml) they are providing         industry with a radical         alternative to concentrating by TFF which becomes very difficult at high         viscosities.
Tuneable drug delivery kinetics: Slowing the release of therapeutic         proteins without covalent         modification is desirable.
Use of a calcium phosphate shell allows         release of proteins from         PCMCs to be tuned from hours to days.
The collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim illustrates how the XstalBio       technology has had an       impact on a client's R&amp;D strategy and investment.
Boehringer Ingelheim       has stated publicly that       "Boehringer Ingelheim believes that the collaboration with XstalBio         will provide improved methods         for the formulation and delivery of biomolecules.
The technology         provides a highly differentiated         method for preparing biomolecules as stable, solid formulations, with         the particles capable of being         engineered for delivery in a range of formulations via various routes of         administration.
Both         partners will jointly develop and scale-up the PCMC technology for GMP         manufacturing at Pilot         scale."
The publication of the 6 filed and licensed patent families impacts on       the overall knowledge base       and direction of the pharmaceutical industry.
This is evidenced by the       presence of 11 patent filings       from other companies, including BASF, Novo Nordisk, Boheringher Ingelheim,       Lek, Taisho       Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd and Domin&#243; &#8212; Ind&#250;strias Cer&#226;micas that reference       the technology and/or       patents.
