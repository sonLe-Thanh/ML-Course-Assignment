     Process from Research to Impact:     Taylor and Bain through a series of reports and publications built a       close working relation with       Scottish Development International (SDI).
This relationship and       significance of the research       resulted in Taylor playing a leading role in nine trade delegations to       India organised by SDI       between 2008 and 2013 and he was appointed a GlobalScot (network of       leading Scottish       industrialists and experts) by the Scottish Government in 2010.
From this       position of influence,       Taylor has been directly involved in the pathway to impact by facilitating       the adoption of the key       research findings by diverse practitioners and policy makers.
Impact on jobs and inward investment strategy &#8212; Scottish Government:     Scottish Development International (SDI) since 2008 has developed a       distinctive position on       Scotland's position within the global economy of business services.
As the       Senior International       Executive at SDI attests, Strathclyde research provided "for the first         time, comprehensive and         reliable data on the sector, that assisted government, employers and         industry bodies to develop         policies and strategies that would make the sector sustainable in the         long term" (Source 1).
SDI       has been convinced of the importance of adopting the internationally       accepted language and       terminology of the industry, particularly Business Process Outsourcing       (BPO), as a preliminary to       Scotland being able to compete in the market for higher-value services.
A       consistent and       distinctive argument was developed that rather than consisting solely of       outflows of capital and       technology to developing countries, the reality of global service delivery       is that developed countries       can play a role in higher value added locations (Source 6 and 7).
Since 2008, SDI and the Scottish Government have been convinced of       recognising Scotland as a       global BPO hub: "Professor Taylor's invaluable research and insights         have been applied by         Scottish Development International to policy and practice" (Source       1).
Between 2008 and 2011,       Scotland's contact sector has expanded in employment from 86,000 to       90,000.
Since 2008, new       inward investors to Scotland who have either established new facilities or       expanded existing ones       include French companies (Teleperformance, WebHelp, CapGemini), US firms       (Hewlett Packard,       Dell, Stellar) and Indian providers (Wipro, Hinduja).
SDI President       (Americas) states that the       research has `influenced and assisted SDI in the development of our         inward investment strategy'       (Source 2).
In certain cases, this investment has followed trade       delegations involving Taylor.
For       example, in 2009 and 2010 delegations to India met with Partha Sarkar (CEO       Hinduja Global       Solutions).
Inward investment in the BPO sector in Scotland has become a       significant trend.
For       example, on 21 June 2010, Hinduja announced the acquisition of Careline       Services based in       Selkirk and confirmed its commitment to job creation.
SDI also attests to       the numbers of       delegations from Indian and global service companies whose visits to       Scotland have been       influenced in part by the propagation of Scotland as a BPO hub.
In       recognition of the explicit       impact of the research, SDI President (Americas) Danny Cusick has       commented, `I have no doubt         that the research work led by Professor Taylor has contributed directly         to the success Scotland has         experienced in developing and growing the sector over the last decade or         so' (Source 2).
Impact on jobs and inward investment strategy &#8212; companies:     Insights on the strengths and limitations of remote contact centre       sourcing in general, and of the       Indian market in particular, has also been utilised by Scottish-based and       UK companies.
For       example, in 2010 Taylor provided a market intelligence report based on the       Indian BPO industry for       the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Described by the company as `timely..         comprehensive and full of         valuable knowledge that was applicable to our situation' (Source 3),       this report drew on both       academic publications and research reports and presented a detailed       analysis of India's capacity       to provide interactive customer contact in the insurance services.
The       conclusion, which influenced       the company's location decision, was that India might be able to deliver       certain relatively       standardised customer services but lacked the ability to provide in-depth       and complex customer       interaction which should be retained onshore (Source 3).
Even more       significant, the company       attests this decision-making sparked a series of developments that led to       the creation of a new       organisation separate from the Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBSG), RBS       Insurance: [the         research was] `an important component and contribution in our         decision-making process...towards         an eventual IPO as RBS Insurance was divested from RBSG in 2012/13'       (Source 3).
Taylor has       also demonstrated that the comparative cost differential with India has       reduced over time, further       enhancing the attractiveness of Scotland (Source 8).
Impact on union policies and labour standards:     The former National Officer at Unite the Union, referring to the original       body of call centre research,       observes that, `it was influential in helping us to understand some of         the difficulties members faced         and what could be done to improve them' (Source 4).
The research on       offshoring has also       informed UK unions' offshoring policies.
The findings provided Unite the       Union with relevant       perspectives and reliable data on the offshoring of call centres.
As a       result of this information,       Taylor was asked to address several national conferences at which policies       were made by the       union and its delegates.
The former National Officer explains how the       research and presentations       contributed to policy development: "The findings have particularly         helped the union, in the very         least establishing the ways in which work conditions can be improved and         in meeting some of the         acute challenges posed by offshoring" (Source 4).
Of equal       importance, the research on Indian       contact centres and on trade union developments underpinned the adoption       of an internationalist       perspective and an aspiration to improve Indian workers' conditions (see       reference 9).
The       international impact of the research is extended further by engagement       with the International       Labour Organisation (ILO).
Referring to the formulation of policies on       decent work and       international labour standards, David Fleming of Unite the Union observed       that, `his [Taylor's]         research has significantly shaped the perspectives of the ILO in         relation to these agendas' (Source       4).
Reinforcing this observation, Jon Messenger the Senior Research       Officer at the ILO, referring       to Taylor's and related contributions to an ILO publication Offshoring         and Working Conditions in         Remote Work, states that ` this volume led to the development of         new legislation on night work in         the Philippines, and more recently, has been cited in the social         dialogue discussions regarding         outsourcing in Brazil' (Source 5).
