Achieving positive changes in local health and social           care policy and practice that           directly responded to the concerns and experiences of older people     The project team worked in partnership with middle and senior managers in       Solihull, Leicester,       Gloucestershire and Manchester local authorities and either Age Concern       and the Alzheimer's       Society.
Some examples of impact in the period 2008 - 2013 are:     Solihull (see sources 1 and 2):            The project findings were used as part of the evidence-base which         informed the revised         dementia strategy;        The findings informed commissioning plans, including the funding of         initiatives to address early         diagnosis, better information and informal support.
For example, an         additional dementia advisor         and dementia outreach support were commissioned from Alzheimer's         Society;        Lack of clear information for people newly diagnosed with dementia was         a key project finding.
Co-researchers were involved in the development of information packs         tailored at the needs of         people newly diagnosed with dementia;         The findings informed decisions about the role of Mental Health         Support Re-ablement Team;         The findings were used in the training of social workers and         re-ablement staff.
Leicester (sources 3 and 4):            The project findings directly informed the adult social care strategy         (`Adult Social Care Vision,         Priorities and Delivery Summary').
The findings triggered or supported a number of developments that         directly address issues         identified by participants.
For example, positive experiences of         re-ablement shared by         participants were used to support the expansion of the service so that         it now works with all         people discharged from hospital;       The Local Authority has developed the role of health and social care         co-ordinators to provide a         better linkage between in-patient and community services;          Manchester:            A report of findings and recommendations presented to senior managers         at Manchester City         Council's (MCC) Adults Health and Well-Being Directorate (28.02.12) was         approved and work         is underway to realise these plans;       Work is ongoing with patient engagement leads across the three acute         hospital trusts to         identify funding, resources and an engagement plan.
Medical consultants         and GPs are         particularly keen on using customer stories to inform learning;       Plans were presented and agreed at three Clinical Commissioning         Groups.
Gloucestershire            The findings were presented to a range of statutory and voluntary         organisations and services         and used to identify priorities.
Three working groups were formed to         take forward action points,         particularly regarding improving communication between professionals and         patients;       The findings shaped Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust         initiatives, including:         staff training on behaviour standards around showing kindness and         respect towards patients;         care of patients round meal times; working with carers to develop a         carers' policy; and creating         information to help patients understand the discharge pathway and         expected experience.

Enhanced the knowledge and practice at national and           local levels     Key national players from organisations including Department of Health       (David Oliver), Care       Quality Commission, King's Fund, Royal College of Nursing, College of       Social Work (Mark Ivory)       and Age UK (Clive Newton), attended a final seminar at which they       discussed how the findings will       inform policy and developments in these national organisations.
Key       individuals were interviewed       about their views on the significance of the project (sources 5 and 6).
David Oliver, former       National Clinical Director for Older People, Department of Health, has       drawn on the project findings       in his work to improve the care of older people, including in a       presentation to the King's Fund and       in his blog (source 7).
The College of Social Work invited the research team to produce a summary       for its Social         Work Matters online magazine and lead an online debate (sources 8       and 9).
The College's online       material is a well-publicised and easily accessible resource for social       work practitioners so this is       an effective mechanism for achieving impact at the level of practice.

Developed approaches that researchers and service           commissioners and providers can           employ to involve marginalised older people in research and service           development and           promoted the citizenship of older people through their participation           as co-researchers     The project has had significant impact in enhancing methods and processes       for engaging       marginalised older people in research and service development.
Co-researchers made a DVD of       their experiences of participating in the project (source 10); this has       been shown at national and       international conferences attended by academics, service managers and       practitioners and it is also       available as a teaching resource to health and social work students.
Members of the project team collaborated with Involve, a national       advisory group that supports       public involvement in NHS, public health and social care research &#8212; to run       an ESRC Festival of       Social Science seminar on participatory research approaches.
Participants       included       representatives of statutory and third sector organisations who were       engaged in or interested in       promoting the involvement of older people in service development and/or       evaluation.
Involve have       utilised the learning about strategies and tools for involving older       people in their own work, use the       project as a case study of positive practice in service user involvement       in research, and include a       link to the resource on their Developing Training and Support resource       pages (source 11 and 12).
The involvement of older people, including the co-researchers, has       developed further within       the local organisations.
In Leicester, drawing on the co-research model, a       Patient Feedback       Volunteer role was developed, with service users and local community       members recruited to       support patients giving feedback about their hospital experience.
In       Manchester, an evaluation of       older people's experiences of the single assessment process was led by       some of the co-researchers.
This adapted the methods and tools used in the transitions project,       including the       narrative interview approach.
The Manchester City Council Programme       Manager for Integrated       Community Provision and a member of the research team have collaborated to       design an       infrastructure and training programme for co-researchers to embed this as       a permanent local       resource.
Evaluation with co-researchers demonstrated that they derived       considerable personal and       social benefits from participating in the project.
These included gains in       skills and confidence,       feelings of satisfaction that they were `making a difference', and new       social contacts and activity.
One co-researcher was invited to take part in a national reference group.
Co-researchers in       Manchester and Leicester are involved in further research and/or training       for these local authorities       while co-researchers in Solihull teach social work students about       participatory research and trainee       doctors about experiences of caring for someone with dementia.
iv.
Enhanced strategies for supporting practitioners and           service providers to access and           utilise research findings.
Older co-researchers were centrally involved in the feedback events in       each site, `giving voice' to       participant experiences by selecting and reading out interview excerpts.
Evaluation from the       feedback events indicated that this was a powerful way of bringing the       findings to life and       harnessing the interest and commitment to change of relevant stakeholders.
Two of the researchers obtained funding for follow-on work with social       work and social care       practitioners in the Solihull site.
This involved the academic and       co-researchers working with small       groups of practitioners to help them identify ways they could apply key       messages from the project       into their daily practice.
The practitioners formulated action plans to       take into practice and these       were evaluated at a subsequent workshop.
Managers were involved in taking       forward issues that       required action at an organisational level.
