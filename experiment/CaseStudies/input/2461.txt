     The UoE work challenged the once popularly held view that 1.
CFS is an       organic disorder for which assessment and treatment are inappropriate or       ineffective; 2.
`functional' neurological symptoms are often eventually       explained by organic disease; and 3. functional `medically unexplained'       symptoms are completely explained by life events, are often short-lived       and the patients can be neither engaged nor treated.
Pathways to impact       The work has been presented at international meetings, and published in       high-impact medical journals with global reach accompanied by UoE and       Medical Research Council press releases and by extensive commentaries on       the importance of the research on the websites of the funding bodies       (e.g., http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Newspublications/News/MRC007706, Feb 2011).
Impact on public policy and clinical practice       The UoE research has led to changes in national and international       guidelines on the management of medically unexplained symptoms and       CFS/myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), e.g., in the UK (Chief Scientist       Office guidance on CFS was endorsed by The Royal College of General       Practitioners in 2010), the USA [5.1] and Australia [5.2].
Professor       Sharpe was on the guideline working group for the USA guidelines.
The work has also led specifically to individual service developments       across the UK (e.g., Yorkshire [5.3], Lothians (2008), Oxford (2013) and       Nottingham (2011)), and directly to changes in what is considered best       clinical practice [5.4].
The work has fed into the development of the International Classification       of Diseases (ICD-11) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the       American Psychiatric Association (DSM-V) [5.5].
Reference has been made to the UoE research in both the House of Commons       and the House of Lords, which has led to political pressure to provide       better services for people with medically unexplained symptoms (e.g.,       House of Commons Early Day Motion 405, July 2010 [5.6]).
Impact on public engagement       Edinburgh work on CFS and medically unexplained symptoms has been widely       disseminated to the public, for instance by coverage on national and       international news (e.g., BBC news, Feb 2011 [5.7]; USA National Public       Radio broadcast by R Knox, Feb 2011; ABC News Australia, Aug 2012) and       articles on the websites of patient organisations [e.g., 5.8].
The Edinburgh group also set up a website for the community of       individuals with medically unexplained symptoms       (http://www.neurosymptoms.org).
This site receives an average of 30,000       hits per month; it has had 466,061 unique hits since its creation in 2009       and has been translated by neurologists into 10 languages.
It is widely       used by clinicians and the public in the USA (41% of hits) and UK (38% of       hits), and is linked from the Movement Disorders Society, Royal College of       Psychiatrists and MS Society websites, in addition to the BBC.
Impact on the economy       CFS costs the NHS &#163;14K per annum per patient and the annual cost to the UK       economy is up to &#163;3.5B [3.2].
It is clear that enormous savings can be       made by effective management of this condition.
A Dutch study suggested that up to 3.6% of the workforce suffers from       CFS.
The UoE research has led to national changes in the occupational       management of individuals with medically unexplained symptoms,       demonstrating effective strategies to reduce absence from work (e.g.,       NHS/Royal College of Physicians Guidance [5.9]).
