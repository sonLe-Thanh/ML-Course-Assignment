     The impact of the research was manifest in four connected ways:     i.
Facilitating links between African, UK and International         communities     Under Professor Okagbue's leadership, AfTA has grown from a new-founded       organisation with 20 members in 2006 to 140 members by 2011 (70% African,       20% UK, 10% other) [1].
AfTA's combination of objectives (`for scholars       and practitioners to meet and exchange ideas' and `to provide information       on African performance and theatre to the wider public') has been pursued       through conferences &#8212; held annually, alternately in African and       non-African venues, including performance/readings of new work such as       Mojisola Adebayo and Mamela Nyamza's I Stand Corrected at AfTA in       Cape Town, July 2012.
AfTA conferences resonate with Okagbue's       interventions focusing attention on performance and development, notably       his keynote Managing our Destinies: Culture and the Arts in National         Development, at the School of Performing Arts, Ghana, 19 October       2012 [2].
ii.
Raising awareness of colonial history     The impact of the Sameboat project has continued through the documentary       film Mami Wata and the Black Atlantic (BlackMadonnaFilms 2007),       uploaded onto the web on 10 May 2008 &#8212; the most viewed section (part 3 of       6) has had 3,459 hits to date (17 November 2013) [3].
Sameboat developed       their work the following year with Black Man Don't Float (2008-9),       a performance collaboration on economic migrancy on which Okagbue was       consultant, performed at the Pierian Centre Bristol (25 November 2008) and       subsequent workshops [4].
iii.
Developing African diaspora work with intercultural communities         in South East London     The Beyond the Linear Narrrative project focused on creating a       community beyond academia.
Holly Pester, a white performance poet and       teacher on a BA English Literature, spoke at the `Transformations of       Narrative' conference (November 2010) organised by Okagbue.
[5a] She       commented afterwards:     `The conference was a valuable experience in terms of locating my         practice of poetics and performance outside its usual parameters.
The         dialogue with practitioners and dramaturges from different disciplines,         cultural references and approach was useful for identifying points of         ethics and narrative... Knowing the debates over the political value of         the term `Post-Colonial Literature' has helped create discussion in         seminars and provide my students with alternative theories within the         field.'
The final conference, `Reconfigurations: Remaking Narrative' (November       2011) [5b] engaged the participation of schools, with local pupils writing       and performing their poems to the conference.
A teacher at Deptford Green       School, South-East London, wrote:     `On behalf of myself, colleagues and Deptford Green students, thank         you so much for the opportunity to partake in the `Reconfigurations'         conference.
It is quite overwhelming to perform in front of such a         talented audience dedicated to learning ...
I am sure you will all have         helped the students to gain the best set of results Deptford Green have         ever had and developed skills they will need for life.'
iv.
Supporting new diasporic writing and performance     Building from Okagbue's research focus, Goldsmiths has become a platform       for new Black writing.
AHRC Creative and Performing Arts Fellow and AfTA       member Gabriel Gbadamosi developed his prizewinning novel Vauxhall       (Telegram, 2013) while based at Goldsmiths 2006-2009 [6].
As part of the       Pinter Centre project, Okagbue mentored Ade Solanke in developing her       plays Celebrate!
and Pandora's Box.
[8] The latter was       performed at the Centre's 2011 `Reconfigurations' conference, followed by       a panel-audience debate featuring Okagbue and Diane Abbott, MP, who said:       `I have been very impressed with Professor Okagbue's work.
I think he         plays a vital role supporting black writers.'
[7].
The play was       nominated for Best New Play in the Off West End Theatre Awards, and ran at       the Arcola Tent theatre in East London from May 9th to 26th       2012.
The performance on May 12th was followed by a discussion,       the panel again including Okagbue and Diane Abbott with Richard Taylor       OBE, the black British community leader and father of Damilola Taylor, who       said `This play...address an issue at the heart of contemporary         British society.'
Solanke considers Okagbue's work to have been crucial both to her success       and the new audiences for African diasporic writing [9]:     `One of the ways the new wave is having an impact on British-African         writers is in terms of practical support for their work.
Another         development is partnerships between experienced `home-grown' artists and         diaspora producers/artists/storytellers [...] An important impact of the         new wave is psychological.
It's been inspiring to see audiences flocking         to the African plays and films that have been on in London over the last         few years.
This May there were three British-Nigerian plays on in London         (my debut, Pandora's Box, included).
This success is due in no small         part to the Arts Council's investment in developing new writing and new         theatre audiences.
Professor Osita Okagbue and Goldsmith College's         Pinter Centre for New Writing were also sources of great support.'
On 23 February 2011 the project hosted a first rehearsed reading by       another writer mentored by Okagbue: Janice Okoh.
Her play, Egusi Soup,       went on to be produced professionally by the Menagerie Theatre Company at       the Soho Theatre from 23 May to 9 June 2012, with a post-performance       discussion panel involving Okagbue, Janice Okoh, the actors and audience       members on 29 May.
Okoh later won the Bruntswood Award for new playwrights       in November 2011, for her other play Three Birds.
[10]     Okagbue's emphasis on performance in the politics of African diaspora       identity has further impact through an actors' collective developed in       collaboration between Goldsmiths, Heavy Wind Media/Bubbles FM, to produce       Our Husband Has Gone Mad Again which toured London between December       2012 and June 2013.
This production provided much needed work to British       actors of African descent.
More of such actor/director collectives are       envisaged, with Goldsmiths serving as an incubating/launching space.
