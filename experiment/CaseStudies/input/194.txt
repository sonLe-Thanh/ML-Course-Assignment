     It has become increasingly important that the provision of healthcare       should be patient-centred and deal with the entire episode of patient       healthcare rather than specific elements of the pathway, e.g.
emergency       care or particular patient groups or pathologies.
This is a difficult task       as patients can take numerous diverse pathways through a healthcare       facility or system, depending on their needs.
Also, with increasing budget       cuts, a cost-effective service is essential.
The multi-phase modelling       approach to pathway management developed at Ulster enables detailed       analysis of both the specific elements of a patient pathway, and its       overall impact on cost, patient quality of life, and clinical outcome.
This research has contributed to the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust       making changes to practice and policy for stroke patient management, and       is applicable similarly throughout the UK:             Impact on public policy and services: policy decisions have         been informed by our research evidence, namely the reorganisation of         acute stroke services in Northern Ireland to provide larger centres.
Health impacts: for appropriate stroke patients, health         outcomes have, therefore, been improved, while for others         quality-of-life has been enhanced since larger centres mean better         coverage and more expertise.
In particular, to cite Dr Y [E3], Associate Medical Director for         Unscheduled Care in the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust, "The         modelling work (McClean) has undertaken for us has been very helpful in         several ways:       In respect of stroke thrombolysis it has demonstrated the value in         terms of better outcomes and reduced cost of significantly increasing         the proportion of stroke patients' thrombolysis.
The reduced costs are         associated with less disability, less need for rehabilitation and less         likelihood of institutional care.
In terms of supported stroke discharge, you (McClean) have clearly         demonstrated further potential gains if we accelerate our moves towards         earlier discharges.
The modelling has also shown that our change of model in the community         schemes with relatively more input from trained rehabilitation         assistants makes the schemes accessible to greater numbers of patients         at substantially reduced costs per case, but with better outcomes.
The models have attracted interest at the highest level in the         Northern Ireland Department of Health and Social Care".
Regarding significance, Dr Y [E3] says that "our use of mathematical       modelling and simulation techniques, based on real-world data, to consider       the effects of proposed changes before they are put in place" has allowed       the service "to confidently and rapidly expand our thrombolysis rates"       with "consequent impact on healthcare budgets and patient       quality-of-life".
"The work on stroke thrombolysis provides better long       term outcomes, whilst at the same time offers modest economic benefits".
As a result, to quote Dr Z [E4] (Consultant Physician, Belfast Trust):       "better public awareness, better health care professional awareness and       more robust systems of delivery have led to increased provision across the       UK."
Dr Y [E3] is also convinced that "the modelling techniques (we) have       previously employed will become vital tools enabling us to consider the       likely effects, whether beneficial or harmful, which our proposed changes       may bring about, both in terms of patient outcome and in terms of the       health economy."
In more general terms, to quote Professor X [E2], former Consultant       Physician, St. George's, London, "following the seminal mathematical work       of (McClean) and Gary Harrison, a small world- wide group of collaborators       have developed, refined, and validated decision support tools which       measure, model and describe the process of care".
While the current impact       has focussed on modelling stroke patient behaviour, the underpinning       research has substantial potential to influence other healthcare areas.
To       quote Professor W [E1], consortium PI of both the RIGHT and MATCH       projects, "Professor's McClean's research under MATCH and RIGHT has helped       to establish the role that management science plays in care delivery, and       provided an excellent backdrop to the more operational studies undertaken       on these programmes."
"Since July 2010, Professor McClean has been a key       member of another community taking simulation and modelling out into the       wider arena of healthcare delivery - the Cumberland Initiative (www.cumberland-initiative.org).
Sally (McClean) has been instrumental in bringing The University of Ulster       to the core of this outreach, and we are now in danger of being highly       successful, with a national centre about to be launched."
Whilst both RIGHT (Brunel, Cambridge, Cardiff, Southampton, Ulster) and       MATCH (Brunel, Birmingham, Nottingham, Ulster) are consortia-led projects,       the work described here was carried out as an exemplar in RIGHT and as a       research strand of MATCH and is solely the work of the Ulster team.
Ken       Fullerton, David Wilson and Peter Millard are healthcare contributors to       the work.
