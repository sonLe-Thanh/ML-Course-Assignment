     Impacts on International Guidelines and Healthcare Policy for Older         Adults     In 2009, MMU research into muscle-tendon properties was incorporated into       the development of exercise and physical activity guidelines for older       people from the US American College of Sports Medicine [A].
These       guidelines are used as the "gold standard" by more than 45,000 medical and       healthcare professionals in the US and internationally.
They offer local       government and other stakeholders the knowledge and opportunity to       establish physical activity sessions specifically tailored to the needs of       older people.
By design, the exercise will help to improve health,       mobility and independence in older age, promote confidence and quality of       life, and reduce the risk of falls and reliance on social and healthcare       services.
The physical activity guidelines cite dozens of original       research articles and our specific research is used as a major reference       of evidence in support of exercise interventions to benefit skeletal       muscles and tendons.
Through the uptake of the findings from MMU studies       (via presentations to government, health bodies worldwide, and the global       media), the reach of our work, can be directly associated back to us.
Research was also cited in earlier UK Department of Health Guidelines: "At         least five a week: Evidence on the impact of physical activity and its         relationship to health &#8212; A report from the Chief Medical Officer         (2004)".
These guidelines, whose primary audience was NHS       professionals, were current for 7 years until 2011, cite Narici's work,       and acknowledge him as an expert reviewer (p91) [B].
MMU research       also informs World Health Organisation diet and physical activity       guidelines for older people [C].
Commercial Impacts on International Exercise Equipment Manufacturers     Since 1990 MMU research has guided the work programme of `Technogym', a       worldwide supplier of resistance exercise equipment to clinical       facilities, rehabilitation units and gyms.
As such our research has       directly impacted upon the exercise equipment used in facilities around       the world and has influenced the design of their exercise equipment       leading to significant commercial impacts.
MMU musculoskeletal research       influenced `Technogym' projects including Fit Age where MMU       research directly influenced the presentation of `Technogym' devices to       potential customers leading to significant sales increases.
Researchers       have also helped `Technogym' to make significant financial savings through       testing new devices for consistency and through calculating the calorific       expenditure of a range of new devices.
As a letter from the Scientific       Research and Communication Manager testifies, "The research         publications from MMU have directly informed our policies and work         programs in relation to resistance exercise training for elderly adults.
The resistance exercise devices present in facilities around the world         have been produced based on careful research and development.
The impact         upon sales for Technogym was significant."
Technogym has an annual       turnover of more than 400,000 Euro and is among the biggest players in the       fitness industry [D]     Exercise equipment has also been developed by Novotec Medical (Stratec       Medizintechnik), a Germany-based designer and manufacturer of training and       therapy devices that utilised MMU research into microgravity and bed rest.
[3]     Clinical Impacts related to vibration intervention and bedrest across         Europe     Research into the musculoskeletal effects of bed rest [3] also       led to the implementation of (i) vibration intervention in hospitals       across Europe; (ii) widespread use of vibration exercise as a clinical       therapy to combat muscle weakness in children.
MMU's work has crucial       importance in the clinical application of vibration as an exercise       modality.
As testimony from the Zentrum for Kinderrehabilitation (Centre       for Child Rehabilitation Germany) demonstrates: "...These recognitions         have been instrumental when conceiving the `Cologne strategy' for the         rehabilitation of children with neuromuscular disturbances with various         underlying pathologies.
Whole body vibration are the main constituents         of this strategy...the Queen Rania hospital for prevention and         rehabilitation is seeing 300 patients per year and is serving as a role         model in Germany and world wide.
Besides the impact of his publications,         Dr. Rittweger has also been a continuous source of information for us in         joint meetings and collaborations and has substantially contributed."
[E].
In order to improve the quality of reports about whole body vibration       treatment studies, the International Society of Musculoskeletal and       Neuronal Interactions invited experts in the field to provide suggestions       on how the intervention should be described in reports.
MMU research       underpinned these recommendations which were published in 2010 and have       impacted on the way in which this work is carried out ever since [F].
Impacts on Local Government Policy in relation to Ageing in the UK     MMU researchers have changed attitudes and raised awareness of the       effects of ageing and musculoskeletal disuse amongst policy-makers and the       wider public.
Onamb&#233;l&#233;-Pearson has formulated responses to parliamentary       questions on exercise physiology and the self-management of chronic       conditions in 2008 and 2012 and has informed government policy on ageing       research through invited ministerial presentations (e.g.
Royal Society of       Physicians presentation in 2007).
Awareness has also been raised at a       local and regional level through engagement with LARCI (Local Authorities       Research Council Initiative) and through participation on the academic       advisory committee of the flagship SPARC (Strategic Promotion of Ageing       Research Capacity) initiative (link to final report here: http://www.sparc.ac.uk/final_review/Final_Report_Ch5.html)       and membership of the prestigious Cochrance Musculoskeletal Group.
Media       coverage of our ageing research has also underpinned policy lobbying       efforts with a major press campaign on the benefits of maintaining a       healthy diet for older people taking place in 2008 [G,H].
In       summary MMU researchers have impacted on government funding priorities for       healthy ageing and rehabilitation practice by using dissemination       opportunities to justify investment and promote the maintenance of       continued funding support.
