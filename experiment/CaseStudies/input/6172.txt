     Biometrics is about identifying people and is now emerging in regular       use.
Just as fingerprinting transformed policing, gait biometrics is       fulfilling the potential to revolutionise the methods employed by security       agencies to identify criminals and terrorists [5.1] and to make life       convenient.
Research at Southampton has advanced gait as a biometric from       concept to reality and it is now recognised internationally as a technique       ripe for societal and commercial exploitation [5.2].
Academics have       actively engaged with military, national police bodies, security agencies,       government departments and the international media in their research, to       deploy and raise the profile of gait biometrics and it receives increasing       focus in forensic practices [5.14].
Impact on Forensic Practice            The research has impacted on forensics, leading in 2008 to the first         use in the UK of gait biometrics as a form of evidence in a successful         criminal prosecution [5.3].
Detectives from the London Metropolitan         Police needed help identifying a man wanted for violent robbery and         approached Southampton after learning of their work from media exposure.
The offender had snatched a bag, with violence.
He left no DNA and had         obscured his face by a helmet, but using CCTV footage, the Southampton         academics could identify him by his gait, beyond reasonable doubt.
The Southampton team have ensured compliance with the Daubert         standards and the recent Law Commission proposals on admissibility of         expert evidence, to enable the technique to be used in forensic evidence         [5.4].
Biometrics, especially gait, features prominently in The Forensic         Science Society &amp; California Association of Criminalists Conference,         Forensic Horizons 2013 [5.14]          Impact on Culture and Society            International broadcast coverage on news channels in all G20 countries         and beyond including [5.7] BBC news, Sky News and ABC News' Good Morning         America GMA has resulted widespread acceptance of Nixon and Carter's         gait recognition techniques for forensic use and for individual         recognition amongst forensic and security professionals (GMA has 4.6m         viewers &#8212; the second most popular news programme in the US [5.8]).
The first public demonstration on BBC1's Bang Goes the Theory (3         million viewers [5.6]) of recognising individuals through their gait,         television coverage of `gait spoofing' on Discovery's Planet Earth         [5.12] and coverage on all the UK major newspapers and radio stations,         resulted in increased public awareness and appreciation of the         application of science to this important area of public safety.
This sustained media exposure has succeeded in raising awareness of         gait biometrics, a contributing factor in the inclusion of gait         biometrics in the popular BBC One series Spooks (Series 10,         Episode 1 18/9/2011, 5.63m viewers [5.6]) in 2013.
Impact on Security Policy and Practice            This increase in awareness of the potential of gait recognition has         been achieved through media coverage and lectures to industry and         decision-makers: Nixon was invited to speak, alongside Sir Keith Vaz, at         the 5th Police Policy Forum Too Much Surveillance in         Oxford (2008) to an audience of UK surveillance policymakers [5.9].
Nixon also lectured on Advances in Noninvasive Biometrics: Gait and           Ear to the Intellect Association (2010), the trade association for         the information technology, telecommunications and electronics         industries.
Follow-ups to these talks included visits to the university by the         Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) [5.10], the Association of Chief         Police Officers (ACPO), the ACPO Criminal Records Office and the Home         Office's Secured By Design initiative.
Southampton's gait analysis system featured in a range of technologies         that were showcased to the Operational Capabilities and Development         division for future use (according to Ralph Wilkins, a SOCA research         officer in the Division) representing a significant impact of gait         biometrics on policy and practice.
The Forensic Science Society &amp; California Association of         Criminalists conference Forensic Horizons 2013 [5.14] gait         (biometrics) features gait prominently, especially for surveillance         analysis.
Economic and Commercial Impact            The rising profile of gait biometrics has raised awareness of the         approach in industry.
The National Physics Laboratory (NPL) has         sponsored an EngD student at Southampton who, together with their         researchers, developed a commercial demonstration of a gait recognition         system to track a recognised individual within a CCTV-monitored area         [5.5].
The system was developed in conjunction with the Centre for         Advanced Software Technology (CAST), the BBC and BAE Systems.
NPL has         earmarked the system for use in high-security environments such as         airports and is pursuing further commercialisation.
An NPL press release         said: "NPL is particularly focused on the standardisation of gait         recognition measurement ...
Developing standards of gait recognition is         necessary to sustain and develop critical security infrastructure         including coded access to buildings and monitoring security threats         [5.5]."
The research has also led to the new Superidentity project, led by         Stevenage, that encompasses aspects that we reveal both in the real         world and in the cyber world [5.11]          The pioneering research at Southampton on gait biometrics has therefore       led to impacts in society and public policy, through impact on forensics,       policy and operational use.
A new system has been developed and       successfully used for identifying criminals leading to a successful       conviction and to a pilot commercial system.
As such, gait biometrics has       been taken from concept to reality, with high impacts and a future that       would not have occurred without the research carried out at Southampton.
