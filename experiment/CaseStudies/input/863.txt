     Durrant's bibliotherapy was applied in collaboration with a       psychotherapist at Leeds refugee charity SOLACE.
From January 2010 to       December 2011, one group of 6 refugees attended weekly 2-hour sessions.
Following the success of this pilot, four new groups of 4-8 refugees were       set up: with SOLACE (December 2012-present); Student Action for Refugees       (STAR, February 2012-present); Bradford Libraries (February       2013-present); and the Eastern Cape Socio-Economic Development Council       (ECSEDC, April 2013-present).
Durrant acts as primary advisor for all       groups, which are led by graduate volunteers with literary and/or mental       health expertise.
Feedback from participants and staff has evidenced the       positive impact on well-being of refugees (i), with the result that       Durrant's model has been adopted by a number of public and charitable       refugee organisations (ii).
i) The impact on the well-being of the refugees     Durrant's bibliotherapy allowed participating refugees and asylum seekers       to work through common feelings of depression and anxiety.
The Clinical       Manager of SOLACE reported that the groups have been successful in       improving mental health `by addressing issues common to asylum seekers       such as difficulty with concentration, memory, anxiety, and confusion'.
In       particular, Durrant's emphasis on the act of reading out loud literary       texts in a group environment had given participants `the opportunity to       reflect on and process their experiences, to put words to them and gain       authority over them' [E].
Bibliotherapy helped group members cope with the `psychological torture'       of asylum seeking.
One participant noted the beneficial effects of       becoming `deeply absorbed in the literary works and intrigued by the       characters,' while another reflected that reading and discussing poems       `helps release us from our anger and abstract [sic] us from our grief.'
Reading about surviving racial discrimination offered one member `hope and       courage [to] rise again from a period of wastage, damage and hurt.'
In the       most powerfully evidential case, a refugee who had been threatened with       repatriation was brought out of a panic attack simply by focusing on the       auditory rhythm of a poem being read aloud [A].
Collectively empathising with literary characters and themes together       allowed members to form a community that served as an antidote to the       isolating experience of seeking asylum in the UK.
The shared act of       entering into fictional worlds prompted one refugee to describe her group       as a `new family' that `helps me have the sense of belonging.'
The group       accordingly renamed itself `Tweyambe!,' a Lugandan expression meaning       `let's help each other!'
Forming community not only restored refugees'       confidence, it inspired them to see how they might contribute to British       society.
Having been granted asylum, 75% of the pilot group have now       entered training as foster parents, teaching assistants, or nurses.
As one       refugee remarked, identification with a fictional character caused her to       `think of ways of helping the British community' [A].
In response to readings, members are also encouraged to produce their own       poetry in creative writing group sessions, and this has improved their       written and spoken communication skills.
The STAR group facilitator       reported that `the continual dialogue, increasing our understanding of       each other's work, has led to [...] members seeing the reading group as a       complementary "intermediate group" to the general conversation classes.'
One member commented that `every single class has helped us understand       more about how to write and speak.'
Participants recommended bibliotherapy       to other refugees who are struggling with English [B].
By improving       English literacy skills, participants were in an improved position to       complete job applications and seek employment.
At the same time, these       poems have helped to raise public awareness of the ill treatment of asylum       seekers.
Members have performed their poetry at public events such as       `Leeds: City of Sanctuary' (May 2011) and have published poems in journals       such as Moving Worlds, the webpages of refugee organisations (e.g.
http://solace-uk.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/by-banks-of-river-asylum.html),       and as part of a Refugee Week poster display.
ii) The imbedding of Durrant's model of bibliotherapy within partner         institutions            SOLACE is convinced of the long-term benefits of bibliotherapy and has         now adopted it as the primary form of group therapy at their counselling         and advocacy centre [E].
This has in turn led refugees to view the         organisation not just in terms of access to services but as a base for         community.
The Clinical Manager of SOLACE, who also acts as an advisor         to similar organisations, now recommends the model as a `sustainable...         effective [and] adaptable therapeutic practice [that] facilitates the         building of connections and community in ways that our other groups and         services do not.'
Following a halving of SOLACE's funding in 2013, a         decision was made to maintain the bibliotherapy group by entering into         partnership with RETAS, a refugee education, training and advice centre         [E].
STAR National Executive received a detailed report from Leeds STAR         leader recommending the formation of new groups across the UK [B].
A consultant working for the ECSEDC in South Africa used Durrant's         bibliotherapy to recover the empathetic capacity of development         professionals dealing with a legacy of trauma.
The group functions both         as `a site of empathetic identification between colleagues' and as `a         dialectical engagement with the socio-historical context that they must         address in the work that they do' [D].
In May 2013 Durrant demonstrated his bibliotherapy at the National         School for Child and Adolescent Therapy to an audience of 50 people, of         whom the majority were practising clinicians.
In feedback 86% found the         lecture interesting/inspiring for their work and 36% stated that it         would influence their clinical/professional practice.
The event         coordinator observed that, while bibliotherapy was new to most         attendees, the presentation convinced them of it as an effective form of         treatment [G].
After witnessing the success of the SOLACE group, the Streatham         Drop-In Centre for Asylum Seekers and Refugees applied for funding to         start a group [H].
A presentation by Durrant as part of Refugee Week 2013 led to the         Leeds City of Sanctuary Movement to consider bibliotherapy to help         schools attain the `School of Sanctuary Award' (award for promoting         positive attitudes towards people seeking sanctuary) [I].
