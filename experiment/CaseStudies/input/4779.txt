     (Note: Bracketed numbers and letters refer to Section 3 and 5,       respectively)     Exeter's research on exercise and smoking cessation has had impact in       three important ways: (1)       informing global health care policy guidelines, (2) generating global       media interest and informing       public debate and (3) providing clinical support for patients and       practitioners on best practice.
(1) Informing global health care policy guidelines     Our Cochrane Review [1] has been cited by organisations around the world       in guidelines on the       use of formal exercise interventions to support smoking cessation (e.g.,       by Royal Australian       College of General Practitioners Australia [A], and by the National Centre       for Smoking Cessation       and Training in the UK [B]).
The absence of clear evidence for the       effectiveness of exercise       interventions to improve long-term abstinence is noted.
Output [2] has       been widely cited as       evidence that a short bout of moderate intensity exercise such as walking       can temporarily reduce       cravings and withdrawal symptoms (e.g., US Surgeon General's 2008 guide on       `Treating Tobacco       Use and Dependence' [C]).
This citation has influenced the adoption of       this source by a wide range       of charities and other organisations offering support to smokers.
Impact on public policy is further demonstrated through Output [4] which       directly influenced the       NICE decision in September 2012 to update their `2006 Review of the public       health guidance       (PH2); Four commonly used methods to increase physical activity (including       `Exercise Referral       Schemes')' [D].
Our review provided new information on exercise referral       scheme effectiveness,       determinants of uptake and adherence, and cost-effectiveness, and       highlighted the need for further       research on interventions to increase uptake and adherence, among patients       with medical       conditions.
As a result, The NIHR-HTA invited bids to evaluate the       effectiveness and cost-effectiveness       of new ways to increase uptake and adherence of exercise referral schemes,       (see       http://bit.ly/1aIgEWw).
As part of our own bid, we have engaged with over 60 exercise       practitioners       and local policy makers on a needs assessment, and content and format of       augmented Exercise       Referral Schemes.
(2) Generating global media interest and informing public debate     Exeter's research on aspects of the acute effects of exercise has       informed public debate, and       generated interviews and reports.
Output [2] has been widely cited on       websites for helping people       to change smoking behaviour (e.g., Ontario Lung Association, Canada: Quit       and Get Fit Fact       Sheet) [E] and also on health-related websites for smokers (e.g.
CVS       pharmacy [F], `Boots'       WebMD &#8212; http://bit.ly/1joU8Y6,       Cancer Institute, New South Wales, &#8212; http://bit.ly/1hZb9wl,       NHS       Choices (http://bit.ly/1ixjmpi).
Significant public debate was generated from Output [6] which arose, in       part, from a mis-reported       headline on the BBC website.
There were 55,000 full text on-line downloads       of the BMJ article in       the first year, and 31 global responses (up to 11/2013) [G] (e.g., from       the UK, Japan, India,       Pakistan, Brazil, Austria, Ireland, USA) from an equal mix of academics,       patients and practitioners.
This is the largest trial of the effects of a facilitated physical       activity intervention for depressed       patients in primary care in the world, to date, and the findings generated       public debate about       differences between trials to test the efficacy of exercise for treating       depression versus the       effectiveness of pragmatic behaviour change interventions that could be       rolled out in a health       service (see a Guest Blog on Scientific American webpage [H]).
(3) Providing clinical support for patients and practitioners on best         practice     Exeter's research has impacted on the development of practitioner led       evidence-based       interventions that can help smokers to quit.
The findings in outputs [1-3]       were disseminated in       invited presentations to over 600 Health and Stop Smoking Service managers       and practitioners       throughout the UK (e.g., Plymouth Stop Smoking Service; Kings Fund       `Improving health outcomes       &#8212; why clusters of lifestyle behaviours matter', March 2012); Bristol Stop       Smoking Advisor       conference, 2012; ASH-Wales conference, Cardiff, 2012; ASH-Scotland       workshop, Glasgow,       2013).
Importantly, there have been many examples of local Stop Smoking       Services who have       applied information from Outputs [1-3] by adding a physical activity       intervention into routine support       such as with structured exercise (e.g., Fife), walking schemes (e.g.,       Coventry), free gym vouchers       (Plymouth), and using pedometers and goal setting (e.g., Bureau of Chronic       Disease Prevention &amp;       Tobacco Control, New York City Department of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene).
As part of our strategy to increase the evidence-base for exercise as a       treatment for nicotine       addiction we have successfully lobbied the NIHR-HTA to prioritise future       funding to fill gaps       identified in Output [1], which has led to an impact on practitioner       practice and public engagement.
Outputs [2, 3] directly influenced the physical activity support       interventions offered by mid-wives to       361 pregnant smokers (see: http://bit.ly/1j9zYkH)       in the LEAP trial, and by Health Trainers to 49       disadvantaged smokers who wanted to reduce but not quit (11 of whom did       attempt to quit) (see       http://bit.ly/1auwLdH)       in the EARS trial.
Translating evidence into practice through the development of pragmatic       physical activity       behaviour change interventions for patients with depression has been a key       focus of our research.
The intervention described in Output [5] was delivered by eight trained       practitioners to 182 patients       with depression from 65 NHS GP surgeries in and around Exeter and Bristol,       and related work       (e.g., http://1.usa.gov/I6p5VM) 	  gave us a unique understanding of practitioner and patient views.
As a consequence, Taylor was invited to develop and twice deliver (to       &gt;20 exercise practitioners in       Dudley and Londonderry) a national Wright Foundation 3-day Level 4 Mental       Health course       (http://bit.ly/1aXMnck),       and provided invited input into the development of the Level 4 National       Occupational Standard: Physical Activity and Health &#8212; Adult Mental health       service users.
`Skills       Active' (http://bit.ly/19qj77y       ).
Since 2008, Taylor has been an invited speaker at a range of       practitioner-based events on physical activity and depression (e.g, Devon       Partnership Trust with       over 30 delegates, St Andrews Hospital Healthcare (UK's largest charity       providing specialist       mental health services) with over 200 delegates, Wright Foundation Annual       Conference with &gt;400       delegates, Somerset MIND conference with over 70 practitioners and service       users, and invited       international workshops for over 100 delegates &#8212; in Norway, Turkey,       Austria, USA).
Taylor was       also invited to write a web-based leaflet on physical activity and mental       health for the Royal       College of Psychiatrists [J] which, with over 15,000 hits in the first       year, is one of their highest user-rated       leaflets.
The leaflet focused on the core principles and theoretical       underpinnings used in       TREAD, including support for self-determined behaviour, overcoming       barriers, and enhancing self-efficacy       and outcome expectancy.
Intervention development work reported in Output [5] led to the invited       publication of practitioner       and policy-based outputs in the Journal of the Royal College of       Physicians, Edinburgh (Donaghy &amp;       Taylor, 2010, DOI: 10.4997/JRCPE.2010.223) and the Oxford Guide to Low       Intensity CBT       Interventions (Editors: Lau &amp; Bennett-Levy).
Our NPRI-4 funded BAcPAc       study, arising from       Outputs [5, 6], led to the training of ten Psychological Well-being       Practitioners working with       depressed patients within Devon's Improving Access to Psychological       Therapies Service.
