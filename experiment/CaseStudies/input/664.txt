     The impact of the research in the REF2014 period of assessment is of       three types:     (i) The generation of the market for Local Electrode Atom Probes     Over the period 2008 - July 2013, 45 LEAP systems have been installed in       laboratories in Japan, USA, Germany, Korea and 12 other countries,       representing sales of $102M, as can be confirmed by the Division Vice       President of AMETEK, Inc.     (ii) The benefits arising from using the LEAP to generate of new         scientific understanding to underpin safety cases for the nuclear         industry     Atom Probe microanalysis has become a vital tool in the study of the       changes in microstructure in reactor pressure vessel steels during       prolonged irradiation.
The LEAP makes a critical contribution to safety       cases for life extension of GEN3 nuclear power plant, as demonstrated by       the following testimonials:     (a) Senior Research Scientist: Central Research Institute of the         Electrical Power Industry, Japan     "We have 3 LEAPs.
The 2nd installed in 2008 and the 3rd in 2009 in our         hot lab.
One of the very important applications of the LEAP in our         institute is to study the effect of neutron irradiation on the         microstructural changes in the reactor pressure vessel steels of the         Japanese nuclear power plants.
Currently we routinely perform LEAP         analysis on surveillance materials from the RPVs of Japanese NPPs.
The         information obtained from this activity is very important to ensure the         integrity of the RPVs.
We mainly work for the Japanese electric         utilities, and the benefit they obtain through the LEAP analyses of         their materials is huge."
(b) Professor in Materials Department: University of California,           Santa Barbara, USA     "We purchased our LEAP in January 2009 and we use it as a central part         of our research on an advanced, potentially technologically         trans-formative, nano-structured ferritic alloy for fission and fusion         applications with remarkable high temperature properties and irradiation         tolerance.
In this project the LEAP is not just important but critical.
We are also using the LEAP as THE core tool in         studying radiation damage to materials used in light water reactors to         provide a basis for nuclear plant life extension.
Without the LEAP it         would be difficult, if not impossible, to develop data and models to         predict the behavior of materials in reactors over periods up to 80         years or more.
Nuclear power is the largest source of C-free electricity         in the US and the economic impact of extended life is enormous -         ultimately totaling at least in the many tens of billions of dollars         range."
(iii) The benefits resulting from the use of the LEAP in the         development of new commercial alloys     The impact of the LEAP in alloy development is demonstrated by the       following testimonials from senior staff in leading international       laboratories:     (a) Director and Head of Department: Max-Planck-Institut f&#252;r         Eisenforschung GmbH     "The Max Planck Society is Germany's most successful research       organization.
The Research Group for Atom Probe Tomography at the       Max-Planck-Institut f&#252;r Eisenforschung was established in 2010 with the       installation of a LEAP.
It is not just important but it is an absolute       breakthrough technology for materials engineering, it is essential for us,       and the research by the University of Oxford has been at the absolute       forefront here: the international community truly owes a lot to Oxford!
Examples for applied projects which we can ONLY pursue through APT       include:            Development of new Mn - based maraging steels.
Development of new pearlite wires as used in type cord, bridges etc.
Development of new thin film solar cell materials.
Development of new hard metal-nitride multilayer coatings for drilling         applications.
Development of new superalloys for 700&#176;C coal power plants."
(b) Professor, Chalmers University of Technology     "We purchased a LEAP in 2008, and it is such an important part of our         materials analysis capability that we established a Materials Analysis         Laboratory as a separate unit studying steels, superalloys, zirconium         alloys and hard materials.
One major project is a new steel for steam         power plants.
The thermal efficiency is limited by the maximum service         temperature of the steel used for components such as turbine rotors and         casings.
Today the maximum temperature is 600&#176;C; limiting the efficiency         to about 45% in the most modern plants.
We aim to increase the service         temperature to 650&#176;C by a new alloying concept.
This would give 50%         efficiency and enormous savings in fuel consumption and carbon dioxide         emissions world-wide.
This development work relies heavily on the         ability of LEAP to analyse very small precipitates.
The work is done in         collaboration with Siemens, Saarschmiede and RWE, ensuring swift scaling         up to commercial products."
