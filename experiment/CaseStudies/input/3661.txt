     Major findings from the `bodies online' project were disseminated in       academic conferences (e.g.
a       2004 SIGCHI conference paper, "Trust and Mistrust of online health sites"       &#8212; downloaded 3,040       times) and published in academic journals, with one of the most       significant papers (176 citations)       published in 2007.
Specific findings (concerning design factors that       predicted trust in e-health       websites) were heavily reported in the press and broadcast media (a link       from the BBC news       website is included as an example below).
The media attention in turn led       to a series of invitations       to professional conferences, including invitations to the eyeforpharma       e-Marketing Summit in 2008       and to the World Health Summit in 2009.
The team were invited to speak to       health organisations       including the NHS, Microsoft (Healthcare Division), Bayer Scherring and       Dipex (a charity       specialising in providing web based patient experience material).
The work       also caught the       attention of the computing community with an article about the work       appeared in PerAda magazine       (2008).
The research has influenced the design of e-health websites with many       sites now using patient       authored content and social media.
Additionally, new Internet start-ups       sprang up to connect       patients together, some of which were directly influenced by our work.
In       support of our role in this       process, we can document six examples of collaborative work and influence:     (i) The pharmaceutical industry responded to presentations of our work       and revised their       website and patient support materials accordingly.
Bayer Scherring's       global head of e-marketing       invited Briggs to Berlin to make a podcast summarising the findings of the       bodies       online project, to be distributed to all e-Marketing staff.
In a written       testimonial, He states:     The work of Professor Pamela Briggs ... has been extremely influential         on the development         of global digital strategies adopted by Schering AG and subsequently by         Bayer Healthcare.
The therapeutic area specifically and immediately impacted was         cardiovascular risk         management (stroke prevention), but Professor Briggs' recommendations         had much         broader relevance across all therapeutic areas and brands.
Her counsel         that `The most         important advice for those trying to promote health information online         is the use of engaging         stories about people with similar experiences'...is now well understood         and accepted as         axiomatic in digital healthcare and in particular health 2.0.
Professor         Briggs' research         findings were truly pioneering in 2007.
Today, with social media far         more widely adopted         and patient story telling taken for granted, her insights can be         regarded as remarkably         prescient.
(ii) Briggs consulted on the early design of Imedo.de &#8212; a web 2.0       health portal that provides       social networking support for patients, developed by Christian Angele and       colleagues and       which now has over 100,000 users.
At an early stage in the development of       the site, Mr.       Angele contacted Briggs, having heard about her work through the media and       subsequently       read some of the team's research papers.
Briggs agreed to act as an       informal consultant       in the design of the site, recommending the use of patient authored       content and social       media input in various ways.
Following the launch in 2007, Wirtshafts Woch       included       Christian Angele in the '50 most interesting young entrepreneurs in       Germany' and the site       imedo.de was listed by Business Week as one of the 50 most interesting       start-ups.
(iii) At an early stage in our research, the team recognised that Healthtalkonline.org       (operated       by the Dipex charity) provided one of the most successful `patient       experience' websites in       the country and sought to work with them to influence the design of their       future sites.
The       charity was chosen by the Department of Health from over 120 applications       to participate in       the testing phase of its new Information Accreditation Scheme that will       `kite mark'       organisations that produce health and social care information.
Liz       Sillence collaborated       with Dipex in the production of two professional journal articles       immediately following the       bodies online project and the wider Northumbria team worked with       them recently (2013) on       a new framework for patient engagement       (http://care.cs.columbia.edu/chi2013health/CRPapers/Briggs.pdf)       and on the construction of       a new set of web design guidelines around peer-to-peer healthcare.
(iv) Omnimedicalsearch.com claims to be the most comprehensive medical       and health search       engine platform on the internet, focusing on results from authoritative       sources.
In 2008 it       released a health and medical forum search engine designed to connect       patients and       caregivers with others who want to share and discuss personal experiences.
The press       release (link below) quoted the founder as noting:     Today's online message boards, chat rooms and forums, those         online-communities, are an         excellent way for people to connect.
OmniMedicalSearch wanted to better         serve the online         communities by offering a directory and search option which encompasses         more than 120         different online forums.
and supported this statement with evidence pulled from the bodies online       project and linked       to the ESRC pages about the project.
(v) The change to e-health design in the commercial sphere has       subsequently been reflected       in UK government policy initiatives for the NHS.
Initially, the       Northumbria team was highly       critical of the NHS web presence which offered little more than online       patient information       leaflets.
However NHS choices, itself launched in 2007, had a stated aim       to personalise       healthcare and provide information that would `allow patients to make       meaningful choices       about when and where to receive their treatment'.
The Northumbria team was       involved in       discussions with the NHS as well as with Microsoft Health (then working on       a major NHS       software project) during 2008, but developed a closer relationship with       NHS choices       through Bob Gann (until recently NHS Choices head of strategy and       engagement) who       writes (November 2012):     Two of the most important planks of the Department of Health's         Information Strategy are         the need to recognise an increasingly diverse information environment         and the importance         of patient voice and experience...Work at Northumbria on models of trust         in online health         information, and particularly guidelines on good quality health         websites, has been very         influential in developing our thinking on appropriate quality assurance.
On the second, we         have been very pleased to work with colleagues from Northumbria as well         as other centres         in the iPex project on patient experience...This has helped shape our         policy thinking on key         issues in capturing and publishing patient experiences.
(vi) Finally, the published research directly informed the development of       the German national       evidence-based health website Gesundheitsinformation.de/Informed Health       Online       (developed by the Institute of Quality and Efficiency in Health Care &#8212;       IQWiG).
The process       for the development of this site is described by Hilda Basian (2008) where       she cites the       Northumbria work in the justification for recommending the inclusion of a       patient experience       component.
The website had over 300,000 page views in January 2008 and the       French       National Health Authority (HAS) translated the material for use within the       French       Healthcare system during 2008.
