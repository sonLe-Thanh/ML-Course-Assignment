     A new methodology developed by Gosling and outlined in Climate, a       Met Office report commissioned by the DECC, allows the impacts of climate       change in different countries to be directly compared.
Climate       provided scientifically valid evidence that informed the EU negotiating       position at the 2011 UN climate change conference in South Africa (COP17)       and the resulting international agreement outlined in the Durban Platform       for Enhanced Action.
The main beneficiaries were the EU delegation at       COP17 and several UK government departments, including the DECC, the Met       Office and Public Health England.
Other beneficiaries include the       governments of the 23 countries for which the report was prepared and       those of several other developing countries who are now better informed       about the needs of communities most vulnerable to climate change.
Climate was launched in Durban on 5 December 2011 by the UK       Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Chris Huhne.
The       Bangladeshi Minister of the Environment and the Mexican Junior Minister       for Environment also participated.
Huhne emphasised the report's       importance in supporting global action on climate change: "This           report highlights some of the very real dangers we face if we don't           limit emissions to combat the rise in global temperature" (b).
He also emphasised how the report would inform the UK position on climate       change mitigation: "The UK wants a legally binding global agreement           to keep the global temperature rise below two degrees.
If this is           achieved, this study shows that some of the most significant impacts           of climate change could be reduced significantly" (b).
Huhne       has since confirmed the report re-affirmed the UK's role as one of the       most active participants in the EU delegation at the COP17 (h).
Following the launch, Climate became a useful resource for EU       negotiators (j) and, when considered in bilateral discussions, underlined       the need to renew international commitment to the Kyoto Protocol (f).
Climate       was also valuable to policy makers from developing countries for whom it       provided "key knowledge... relevant to their own national           circumstances" (h).
Huhne, the lead UK negotiator in Durban,       has stated that the report provided smaller developing countries with "the           knowledge to be more aggressive and to isolate China and India and           make it clear that they would be the obstacle to a commitment or           global agreement" (h).
The G77 developing countries split for       the first time in Durban into a group including Brazil, South Africa, the       Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), and the Least Developed Countries       (LDCs) that supported the EU's position and another group that included       India and China.
According to Huhne: "That in turn put quite a lot           of pressure on India because they didn't want to be seen as the           country that was holding out against everybody else... [which] was the           final building block" (h).
The negotiations at COP17 were       finely balanced and the report proved crucial in achieving a consensus       behind the EU plan for a `road map' to secure a global legal agreement on       climate change no later than 2015, the scheme eventually agreed in the       Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (h).
As Huhne stated at the end of the       conference: "This is a significant step forward in curbing emissions           to tackle global climate change.
For the first time we've seen major           economies, normally cautious, commit to take the action demanded by           the science" (c).
During the event, 500 copies of Climate were distributed to       delegates.
Wider dissemination was subsequently enhanced by translation of       appropriate sections (e.g.
the volume for Egypt is available in English       and Arabic).
Additional national launches took place in other countries,       including Egypt and Mexico (i).
Climate received widespread media       attention in the UK and internationally, with discussion of its findings       appearing in the UK in the Guardian, the Daily Mail, the Daily         Telegraph, the Scotsman, and internationally in Le Monde       in France, H&#252;rriyet Daily News in Turkey, BBC Brazil, and       CNN in the United States.
The FCO cited the report in bilateral       discussions with several countries, including China, India, Mexico and       Egypt.
In some developing countries, media coverage of the report nudged       public opinion on climate change and helped change the positions of some       of the more pertinacious delegations (h).
Climate was also "mentioned           within speeches and presentations as part of other events &#8212; such as by           Sir John Beddington [UK Government Chief Scientific Advisor] in           Australia and at a green business fair in South Africa" (j).
Beyond COP17, research undertaken in the preparation of Climate       has prompted governments to re-consider their options for adapting to       climate change.
At the Durban launch, the Bangladeshi Minister for the       Environment stated that: "This report will contribute significantly           to our national policies" (a).
As a result of its       dissemination by the FCO, Climate is being used to inform a       national climate change adaptation plan for Mexico, one of the few       developing countries that are formulating a national strategy (h).
The       British Ambassador to Mexico has stated that: "Projects such as the           DECC/Met Office report... play a valuable part of the campaign to           shape the political conditions needed if we are to get the global deal           required on climate change" (e).
Climate is also cited in a number of major policy reviews       undertaken by the UK Government, including the first UK climate change       risk assessment (d), and the latest analysis by Public Health England of       the potential health consequences of climate change (g).
