     Pathways to Impact     The impact on Enfield has been achieved through initially publishing       CRESC research such as the       national business model working paper in 2009 which led to the initial       contact from Enfield       councillors; then from early 2011 making presentations of this work with       additional local empirics to       Enfield councillors and officers before engaging in a collaborative and       iterative process of working       alongside the Council in a mentoring role after setting out a CRESC menu       of new policies.
As an Enfield councillor writes (Soundings 2013 [A]) "leading CRESC         members came to Enfield         and after researching the specifics of our predicament, drafted a list         of 18 potential policies that         they submitted to senior Labour Group and Council officers."
Specifically CRESC presented pre-existing       research on job creation and on inequality plus new Enfield exhibits which       showed the       borough measured up like a de-industrialised Northern town.
This was the       rationale for radical new       policies.
Reach and Significance     The Centre's researchers argued that Enfield Borough would benefit from a       suite of innovative       policies which paid much more attention to building short chain linkages       within the fragmented       local economy, and at the same time the Council needed to review value       extracting activities       (around pension fund saving, utility services and big box retail), where       the local community       generated fees and profits elsewhere and got little in return except a       basic service.
CRESC       highlighted areas where the Council subsequently carried out detailed       research e.g.
into local CSR       by utilities and supermarkets in response to CRESC suggestions and prompts       about new policy       directions.
Enfield' Council officers and councillors came together to launch the New       Directions programme.
The autumn 2012 update [B] on the programme highlights a new and       distinctive vision of the local       council's leading role in regeneration.
"Ultimately, it's about         addressing the problem of the         fragmented economy, rebuilding local supply chains and ensuring those         who make profit locally         also reinvest locally.
The Council is uniquely placed to broker         opportunities to take this forward."
The direct impact of the application of CRESC's research within Enfield       has been a major change       in council strategy and policy, as noted by the Council's Director for       Regeneration [F],     "As Director of Regeneration for Enfield Borough Council, I can         confirm that CRESC research and         subsequent policy recommendations have directly led to a major shift in         the council's regeneration         strategy and policy."
In September 2011 a CRESC presentation to the council made direct       recommendations involving       specific changes in 18 identified strategies and policies.
Three of these       that have now been acted       on are detailed below:            CRESC persuaded Enfield to inquire about what utility companies and         supermarkets were         reinvesting in the local community whose household demand they were         capturing.
An         Enfield councillor led conversations with British Gas with substantial         results detailed below         and Thames Water released a 5 year schedule of works so that the Council         could         encourage local contractors and train labour [E].
CRESC reminded Enfield of its history of market garden food production         for London, with         Waltham Forest the largest glass house district in Europe until the late         1950s.
In line with         CRESC's arguments, the Council now plans to build a 50 acre commercial         glasshouse         using waste heat from an incinerator and to train up a local labour         force       CRESC asked why, if the Enfield local government was earning 5 % or         less in the City of         London, the money could not be invested for similar returns in social         housing, which is in         chronically short supply in all the North London Boroughs.
Since Spring         2012, Council         officers are working on releasing a portion of the Enfield Council         pension fund for         investment in social housing which will be invested in an adjacent         borough which then         invests in Enfield          The Council's changes in policy and strategic direction in direct       response to recommendations       from CRESC research have recently resulted in new investment.
In       particular the       recommendations surrounding the investigation into Utility company       reinvestment have led to,       British Gas's Director for Business Development signing contracts       totalling more than &#163;10 million in       ECO investments in March 2013 [C].
These investments will be used for       retrofitting local housing       with insulation and the New Directions programme will ensure local job and       supply chain benefits.
As the Chief Executive for Enfield Council writes [D],     "In the two areas where we have made most progress with job creation         in the short run, CRESC         was crucial because their researchers made policy suggestions which         officers and councillors         followed up.
It was CRESC which initially suggested that we press         utilities to localise corporate         social responsibility and the end result is several hundred jobs         anchored by a signed &#163;10 million         contract with British Gas."
Over the two year contract, British Gas plans to hire 100 Enfield school       leavers directly and will       work with local further education colleges to train the Enfield job       seekers.
British Gas has also       expressed interest in partnering LB Enfield, FE colleges and other       stakeholders in building a       University Technical College on one of Enfield's big regeneration sites.
British Gas is including in its supply chain a number of specialised       Enfield-based construction       sector SMEs, local firms staffed by local residents who are undergoing the       requisite energy-efficiency       accreditation process giving them the skills to participate in this growth       industry.
With a       prime contractor like British Gas anchoring operations, Enfield has       attracted a major first-tier       supplier that is looking to move into abandoned industrial premises and       hire upwards of 50 people       in insulation manufacturing operations &#8212; and 250 in installation       professions [G].
All in all, this British       Gas deal is expected to be worth approximately 400 skilled industrial jobs       to Enfield.
