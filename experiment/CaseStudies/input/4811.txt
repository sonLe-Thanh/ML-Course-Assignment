     CML is classified as an orphan disease&#8212;one so rare that it only affects a       very small number of       people and might, therefore, be a low priority for pharmaceutical company       pipelines.
However, if       left untreated, late-stage CML can be fatal within 3-6 months and its       prevalence is increasing.
CML is anticipated to become the commonest leukaemia in the future,       highlighting the urgent need       for new therapies.
Bone marrow transplantation was long considered the only realistic       treatment for CML, but it is a       toxic procedure that requires suitable donor tissue and is associated with       serious side effects and       high death rates.
Crucially, bone marrow transplants cannot be performed       in older patients and the       average age of CML onset is 55-60 years.
Directed therapy with imatinib       changed the landscape       of CML care forever: what was once a deadly disease became a persistent       but manageable       condition&#8212;many patients now live essentially normal lives after diagnosis.
Consequently, although       the incidence of CML remains stable, its prevalence has dramatically       increased since TKIs became       widely available.
University of Glasgow researchers have taken a mechanistic approach to       understanding the       factors influencing CML stem cells with a view to identifying new       therapeutic targets.
Holyoake's       team was the first to demonstrate that TKIs are only the initial step       towards curing CML.
A leading       expert on CMLa and former winner of the highly prestigious       Lasker prize for the development of       imatinib states the importance of this finding: "Holyoake was the first         to alert the clinical research         community to the fact that cancer stem cells could not be killed by         imatinib.
Her work on the         concept of cancer stem cells has since been confirmed in other blood and         solid cancers."
Impact on industry     Holyoake has worked closely with key industrial partners, such as       Novartis and Bristol-Myers       Squibb (BMS), acting as consultant, opinion leader and international       advisor, as well as Principal       Investigator for numerous international clinical trials.b Her       research has led to a paradigm shift in       the research and development (R&amp;D) strategy of the pharmaceutical       industry, refocusing the       efforts of major companies towards a cure by pursuing the TKI-resistant       CML stem cell population,       which in turn has translated into clinical trials of innovative compounds.b,c     Novartis, the third largest pharmaceutical company worldwide in 2012, has       developed a 10-year       strategy to achieve, "successful TKI discontinuation and potentially         provide an operational cure for         CML patients."
This strategy was developed at a Novartis Advisory       Board meeting at which       Holyoake was the sole UK expert.c The pathogenesis-driven       pathways identified by Holyoake's       research were incorporated as key targets for the development of novel       therapies to be given in       combination with first-generation or second-generation TKIs.
According to       Novartis,c "Professor         Holyoake is one of very few clinician-scientists with a long-standing         interest and expertise in LSC         [CML stem cell] biology ... her work has led to the current         understanding of LSC kinetics in CML         and the development of possible treatment approaches for the management         of minimal residual         disease."
He continues: "Novartis Oncology has regularly chosen         Professor Holyoake to participate         as an expert advisor on stem cell biology for our global Advisory         Boards.
Professor Holyoake has         participated in several Novartis-sponsored global clinical trials in CML         as Principal Investigator.
Only a limited number of global experts with expertise in the conduct of         CML trials are chosen for         this role."
Novel compounds enter clinical trials for CML     Access to the R&amp;D pipelines of pharmaceutical companies has enabled       Holyoake and her group to       identify compounds that kill CML stem cells in the laboratory, providing       the basis for their       progression into pioneering clinical trials.
For example, a pathway called       hedgehog, which is       known to regulate stem cell functions such as growth, death and       development, was shown to be       highly active in the CML stem cell population.
Pharmacological inhibition       of this pathway is being       investigated by both BMS and Novartis.b,c     University of Glasgow researchers Drs Mhairi Copland and David Irvine are       listed as co-inventors       (with three Novartis employees) of the hedgehog blocker LDE225 in a patent       application filed by       Novartis in the USA (12/539855) and more than 15 other countries       (PCT/US2010/045133).d A       phase I trial of LDE225 plus the TKI nilotinib (NCT01456676) was initiated       by Novartis in January       2012 to assess toxicity and maximum tolerated dose.
This trial is       currently recruiting 36 CML       patients from 17 centres in 9 countries in North America, Europe and Asia.
Copland also led the correlative stem cell assays for patients recruited       from all participating centres       worldwide for a phase I trial of the hedgehog blocker BMS-833923 plus the       TKI dasatinib       (NCT01218477).e This dose-assessment study was initiated by BMS       in January 2011 and       recruited 27 CML patients from 12 centres in 7 countries in North America       and Europe (analysis is       currently underway).
The University of Glasgow was the sole UK centre for       this trial.
Established drugs offer a fresh approach to treating CML     Hydroxychloroquine&#8212;an antimalarial drug also used to treat inflammatory       diseases&#8212;was shown       by Holyoake's team to kill CML stem cells by blocking autophagy.
Holyoake       is leading the phase II       CHOICES study (NCT01227135), the first clinical trial to investigate       treatment responses to the       combination of hydroxychloroquine and imatinib.
CHOICES began in March       2010 with the target to       recruit 66 CML patients from ten centres in the UK, Germany and France.
As       of July 31st 2013, 36       CML patients have been recruited, 18 of whom have received this       combination therapy.
Public engagement     Holyoake instigated and led the establishment of the Paul O'Gorman       Leukaemia Research Centre       (POGLRC), an enterprise funded by more than 1,800 charitable donations       totalling in excess of       &#163;2.6 million, many of which were made by CML patients, their families and       friends.
POGLRC       benefits patients with CML throughout the UK by giving them unprecedented       access to the latest       clinical trials.
The centre was officially opened on 22nd May 2008 by Dr       Richard Rockefeller,f,g a       practicing clinician who himself has CML.
Rockefeller donated $200,000       (approximately &#163;124,000)       to help launch POGLRC and at the opening ceremony said "I have chosen         to support POGLRC         because among all the world's researchers, Dr Tessa Holyoake and her         extraordinary staff stand         out as offering the greatest promise of a medical cure for the leukaemia         from which I have         suffered."
Established in 2009, the "Friends of POGLRC" is a committee of patients,       volunteers and donors,       chaired by Holyoake and administered by University of Glasgow, who raise       awareness of, and       conduct fundraising and educational activities for, the centre via social       media.h The importance of       cancer stem cells in driving drug resistance of leukaemia is the key       message conferred through       laboratory open days and regular newsletters.
Over the past 5 years, more       than 2,000 people have       taken part in Cycle Glasgow, raising approximately &#163;160,000 for POGLRC.i       The event is supported       by local and national companies (including Tunnock's, Costco, Grease       Monkey Bicycles and       Overton Farm Shop) who supply food and water for the participants.
In       addition, Tunnock's fields a       team of fundraisers who to date have raised around &#163;10,000.i In       August 2008, the profile of this       event was raised by the participation of record-breaking cyclist and       broadcaster Mark Beaumont.
Further events promoted by the Friends of POGLRC have included       international treks (Vietnam,       China and Africa, 2010), a zip slide across the river Clyde (2012), gala       lunches (2012) and a       fashion show (2013).i     In November 2009, Holyoake received a Scottish Health Award for her work       in clinical cancer care       at a ceremony hosted by the Scottish Government and the Daily Record       newspaper.j She later       received an award from the Lord Provost of Glasgow for services to health       (May 2011).
These       awards honour people who have dedicated their professional lives to public       service or worked       selflessly for their communities.
In 2013, Holyoake was one of 44 new       Fellows elected to the       Academy of Medical Sciences, which "promotes the best of medical         science for the benefit of         society."
