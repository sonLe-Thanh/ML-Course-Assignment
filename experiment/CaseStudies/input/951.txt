     The research on the aesthetics of photography has fired public debate       about the status of photography as an art.
Specifically, it has raised the       profile of modern British art photography, contributed to the position of       independent galleries, and influenced curatorial ideas about the nature of       photography.
These impacts have been achieved through an exhibition of an       under- exposed contemporary British photographer, workshops with gallery       curators and conservators, public events, and through non-academic       publications such as books, exhibition catalogues and podcasts.
High profile events have brought the researchers and their academic       networks into contact with practising photographic artists and curators.
These include: a two day panel with art theorists, curators and critics at       the Association of Art Historians Conference at Tate Britain       (3-4.04.2008), a two day event with photographic artists at the Institute       for Philosophy, London (21-22.11.2008) and a public conference, `Agency       and Automatism', at the Tate Modern (10-12.06.2010) with a keynote by Jeff       Wall, the most influential contemporary photographic artist.
This       conference, ticketed by Tate (&#163;25/&#163;20 concessions), sold out the 250-seat       Starr auditorium (for a total income of &#163;6250) and attracted a substantial       waiting list.
Podcast recordings of the talks are available through Tate       and ITunes and have been downloaded 1480 times in 2013 alone.
The       popularity of the conference and podcasts demonstrate the public appetite       for discussion about photography's aesthetic and artistic significance.
The research stemming from these events was published as special issues of       the leading journals Art History, The Journal of Aesthetics         and Art Criticism and Critical Inquiry and in book form for       a general readership.
Photography after Conceptual Art, published       as a book in 2010, has sold over 2000 copies (as of August 2013) making it       the best-selling title ever in Art History's book list.
Costello was invited to curate `Twenty-Nine Pictures,' the first       mid-career retrospective of Hannah Starkey, an important but under-exposed       contemporary British photographer at the Mead Gallery, Warwick Arts Centre       (Jan-Mar 2011).
This was accompanied by 85pp hardback colour catalogue,       with an essay by Iversen and an interview by Costello.
The show was       reviewed in traditional media and online magazines/blogs including the       Claudia Winkleman Show (BBC Radio 2, 04/02/11; approx.
audience 2.5       million, RAJAR figures), The Times, The Independent, The         Telegraph, eight specialist photography magazines/websites as well       as 30+ general websites and blogs.
The Telegraph online culture       pages reprinted an extract from Costello's interview with the artist.
The       show was listed as an `Art must-see' for January 2011 by the leading       culture website Culture24.
The exhibition recorded a footfall of 6812 visitors over 49 days, a daily       average of 139.
In 2010-11 the Mead's average was 108, in 2009-2010 it was       94; as such it is the Mead's most successful show of the last 3 years.
100       copies of the catalogue were sold during the show at a special price of       &#163;10, 107 were sent to various critics, curators and institutions around       the world (at no cost), and a further 183 sold by the gallery's       distributor (at &#163;16 each; total &#163;2928).
The evening discussion (1 Mar       2011) with Starkey was over-subscribed (138 turned up for a 100 seat event       and many stood) and the podcast has been downloaded 544 times to July       2013.
This level of exposure helps justify the gallery's existence as the       only space-intensive, non-income generating resource within the Arts       Centre, and thereby ensure that it remains free to the public for the       foreseeable future.
As her first curated retrospective, the show also       raised the profile of an important UK-based photographer, thereby       benefiting both the artist and her gallery, Maureen Paley (London),       generating interest in a further one-person show at Ormeau Baths Gallery       in Belfast (3.6 - 9.7.2011).
As part of Prof Lopes' Leverhulme Professorship, Costello and Lopes       convened a seminar for Tate curatorial staff, V&amp;A conservators and       invited specialists at Tate Modern (May 2012) to coincide with the       publication of their special journal issue `The Media of Photography'.
About the philosophical conceptions of photography discussed, Tate's       Director of Collection Care Research said:     `It is surprisingly rare that the divide between the museum and academy       is breached and in speaking to the museum curators and conservators       afterwards they very much appreciated the opportunity to engage in this       discourse.
The discussion of the photographer Dan Holdsworth was picked up       the following week at a Photography Acquisition Meeting.
This linked the       questions raised in the seminar about the defining characteristics of a       photograph to curatorial decisions and discussions.
In this very direct       way, the seminar has had an impact on the discourse within the museum in       relation to contemporary photographic practice.'
Costello has also contributed to catalogues for exhibitions in the UK       (White Cube, London) and Russia (The Hermitage, St. Petersburg).
