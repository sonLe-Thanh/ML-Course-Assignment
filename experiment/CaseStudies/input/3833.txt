     The underlying aim of the research was to provide evidence-based       recommendations to improve clinical standards and patient care whilst       reducing falls in amputees and improving patient well-being.
The knowledge       gained through biomechanical analysis has been used nationally and       internationally to inform and design appropriate and targeted exercise       intervention strategies aimed at attenuating the loss of musculoskeletal       function and reducing falls in lower limb amputees.
The published works       described above have had a significant clinical impact on amputee       physiotherapy treatment and the revision of existing healthcare guidelines       and policies related to lower limb amputees in the UK and more recently       internationally in Australia (sources 1-10).
The 2008 audit findings revealed that 79% of lead physiotherapists within       the main Disablement Services Centre across the UK used some form of       outcome measure in amputee rehabilitation.
However, there were no       standardised procedures in place on frequency and the specific outcome       measures (generic compared to population-specific) utilised.
Moreover,       only 7% of physiotherapists audited monitored falls formally.
These data       were disseminated by invitation to the 2009 BACPAR annual conference       (source no.1) having been published previously in their professional       journal (source no.2).
Recommendations made to standardise the use of       clinical outcome measures resulted in the BACPAR Toolbox of Outcome         Measures (2010), implemented by physiotherapists nationally (source       no.3).
Following on from the work done by Vanicek and colleagues (2008),       more recent independent research has examined the current use of outcome       measures by amputee physiotherapists, occupational therapists and       prosthetists (Queen Margaret University, unpublished doctoral research,       2012).
The investigator comments (source no.4) that this study revealed       that all healthcare professionals surveyed were routinely using outcome       measures in their clinical practice.
This higher survey value indicates that healthcare practitioners are now       more aware of the relevance of outcome measures in monitoring patient       progress and evaluating successful treatment.
BACPAR acknowledge the       contribution of Dr. Vanicek to the working group and are committed in       updating the present Toolbox of Outcome Measures (2010) to reflect       current and best practice (source no.5).
Subsequent invited presentations       by Dr. Vanicek to the Australian Physiotherapists in Amputee       Rehabilitation (AustPAR), in September 2012 and June 2013, have further       disseminated recommendations on the standardisation of outcome measures in       clinical practice (source no.6).
Head Physiotherapist at Port Kembla, NSW,       Australia (source no.7), reports:     "Objective clinical outcome measures of walking velocity, Timed Up and         Go, AMPPRO, two minute walk distance and the four square step test have         become routine at our Rehabilitation Hospital.
The feedback to the         patients on their weight bearing progress, and speed has encouraged each         new patient to progress a little more each day.
I feel a great sense of         accomplishment as each patient fulfils their goal of domestic or         community ambulation with their prosthesis.
Research in this area is         vital to clinicians who in turn have a direct impact on each new         amputee."
Several published outputs (Vanicek et al.
2009a; Vanicek et al.
2009b;       Vanicek et al.
2010; Barnett et al.
2009) make specific recommendations       for targeted exercises strengthening specific lower limb musculature and       joints during weight-transfer tasks for falls prevention.
These research       findings have significantly changed physiotherapy practice in the UK and       internationally, by prompting clinicians to develop patient-specific falls       prevention goals.
Head of Physiotherapy in Port Kembla, NSW, Australia       (source 7), states:     "Australian Physiotherapy in Amputee Rehabilitation (AustPAR) has         progressed with Dr. Vanicek's research findings in regard to training         balance control.
The early use of mobility aids as temporary /interim         prostheses has provided the modifiable prosthesis while the stump         matures (Barnett et al, 2009)...
The reported significance of hip and         ankle strategies for balance control (Vanicek et al., 2009b) has changed         my practice to devote more patient practice to hip extension exercise         with the patient in late stance, and more eccentric lower limb exercises         in preparation for recovery for a misstep (Vanicek et al., 2009a).
My         patients have found that strengthening and partial weight-bearing         practice has prepared them for the whole gait practice and helped them         to develop much more trust in the prosthesis".
Additional impact of the underpinning research is reflected in the       recently updated (2012) Evidence Based Clinical Guidelines for the         Managements of Adults with Lower Limb Prostheses, by the Chartered       Society of Physiotherapy, which makes specific reference to the work of       the group within their guidelines on prosthetic rehabilitation programming       (source no.9).
Citing Barnett et al.
(2009), together with other papers,       new Guideline 4.4 (page 22) states;             The physiotherapist should prescribe a personalised exercise           programme incorporating specific muscle strengthening and stretching           exercises and maintaining/ improving joint mobility as part of the           prosthetic rehabilitation programme.
Several of the published outputs (Vanicek et al.
2009a; Vanicek et al.
2009; Vanicek et al.
2010; Barnett et al.
2009) have also informed       guidelines on amputee rehabilitation programme design, including the       appropriate selection of early walking aid according to the patient's       abilities and the centre's facilities as well as exercise prescription       according to the patient's rehabilitation goals.
Regional amputee       specialists (Hull and East Yorkshire NHS Hospitals Trust (source no.8)       state;     "The research has provided physiotherapists with specific evidence to         guide practice to maximise the clinical impact of treatment programmes.
This has informed National guidelines and provided new evidence to         inform best practice".
The early impact of the published outputs from the group relating to the       Hull Early walking aid for rehabilitation of transtibial Amputees       (HEART) study have ongoing implications for sustainable and best clinical       practice.
Within the Table of papers referenced within Appendix 8 of the       updated guidelines (2012), the following are stated:            Gait adaptations occurred once prostheses received.
Different           adaptations caused by PPAM-aid &amp; AMA but walking performance and           walking ability improved once prosthesis used.
Study didn't show clear benefit of either EWA on gait patterns with           prostheses but did mention documented benefits of accelerated healing           and reduced time to casting from surgery using EWAs.
The tabular summary also notes; Transtibial amputees may benefit from         additional exercises to increase muscle length &amp; strength and joint         mobility of lower limb (source no.9).
Consultant Vascular Surgeon       and Clinical Director for Vascular Services at Hull &amp; East Yorkshire       NHS Hospital Trust (source no.10) comments:     "The economic implications of these research findings are clinically         meaningful.
EWAs are used extensively and routinely in all         post-amputation rehabilitation programmes.
It is now evident there is no         significant clinical or quality of life advantage of using the more         expensive AMA.
Therefore, the AMA can be reserved for situations where         the PPAM is unsuitable or unavailable without affecting a patient's         treatment adversely.
Healthcare providers can be confident they are         delivering the same standard of care despite using a more economical         alternative to the AMA".
