Changing thinking about and triggering reforms to prison policy     Since 2008, Naughton has influenced the treatment of prisoners       maintaining innocence by communicating his research findings to policy       makers including the Parole Board and the National Offender Management       Service (NOMS).
This was done by communicating his findings [1] [2] [3]       [4] to these agencies at the Home Office and to the House of Commons,       acting as stakeholder for the Parole Board and running a series of       workshops for the Parole Board.
These efforts led to an unprecedented       acknowledgment from NOMS, which oversees the work of prisons and       probation, and the Parole Board that some prisoners may, indeed, be       innocent and that the traditional blanket label of them as `deniers' is       inappropriate [a] [b].
His research also led to a new way of assessing       prisoners maintaining innocence by prison and probation staff.
In       particular, it heavily influenced the design of NOMS's training course       `Managing Indeterminate Sentences and Risk' (MISaR) [a], which has been       delivered to circa 30,000 prison and probation officers across the UK       since 2008.
Naughton was consulted in the design of MISaR during a visit       at the University of Bristol by NOMS's Indeterminate Sentenced Prisoners       Lead in 2008.
The course incorporates Naughton's research [4] and educates       prison and probation staff on the reasons why prisoners may claim that       they are innocent when they are not (for example, due to misunderstanding       of criminal law, disagreeing that what they have done should be a criminal       offence or protecting a family member).
Most significantly, prison and       probation staff are now trained to provide such prisoners with information       about the criminal appeals system and organisations that could assist them       in overturning their convictions.
Another related impact of Naughton's       research in this area is the amendment of Prison Service Order (PSO) 4700,       implemented by NOMS in July 2010, which takes into account the `typology       of claims of innocence' devised by Naughton [1] [4].
Acknowledging for the       first time that some prisoners are likely in fact to be innocent, PSO 4700       also adopts the recommendations in Naughton's research findings [4] and       provides guidance to Offender Supervisors on the management of prisoners       maintaining innocence [c].

Creating 26 pro bono innocence projects which have influenced         casework and generated pro bono work equivalent to over &#163;5 million     Naughton led the process of establishing a network of innocence projects       in the UK through the vehicle of the Innocence Network UK (INUK) (www.innocencenetwork.org.uk)       which he founded at the University of Bristol in 2004.
26 of these were       operating as of June 2013.
INUK was established as a practical response to       Naughton's initial findings from his research begun in 2001 and published       in 2007 [3].
From the outset Naughton has employed an entrepreneurial       approach to funding the employment of a full time member of staff for INUK       to enable its development and sustainability.
INUK's innocence projects       generate a conservative estimate of 100,000 hours of pro bono work per       annum.
This is achieved by around 500 university staff and student       caseworkers each year working an average of 5 hours weekly and an       additional 4,000 hours of free work provided by legal and forensic       experts.
At legal aid rates, this equates to a notional monetary value of       &#163;5 million per year (500 caseworkers x 5 hours x 40 weeks x &#163;50 per hour).
This increases by an estimated further &#163;250,000 for the work that the pro       bono lawyers and experts give freely to INUK projects, also based on legal       aid rates for solicitors.
Overall, the resources generated by INUK have       enabled and improved access to justice in an area where public funding is       notoriously limited [e].
As of January 2013, twelve applications have been       submitted to the CCRC and the Scottish CCRC following full investigations       by INUK member innocence projects.
Three cases have also reached the Court       of Appeal [d, page 19].
These casework impacts are unlikely to have       occurred without the research that led to the establishment of INUK and       that has shaped the ways in which INUK member innocence projects operate.

Supporting and shaping the practices of innocence projects     Since its establishment in 2004, Naughton has directed INUK as a cohesive       and integrated informal body for assessing alleged wrongful convictions       and referring eligible cases to member innocence projects for full       investigation.
The need for such an initiative to promote the review of       alleged wrongful convictions stems from Naughton's research, which       identified a gap in the provision of such assistance [2] [3] [5].
As of       June 2013, INUK had received 1,285 requests for assistance, of which       around 223 were deemed eligible for full investigation and 113 cases of       those were referred by INUK to member innocence projects for full       investigation [d, page 19].
INUK's central case referral system saves INUK       member innocence projects many thousands of pounds per annum in       administrative costs.
Such efficiency savings allow limited resources to       be focused on clients/prisoners and students.
The absence of       innocence-focused law clinics in the UK meant that prior to existence of       INUK no guidance was available on how innocence projects should run to       ensure that clients receive a professional standard of care [2].
Naughton       instituted quality control to the services provided by devising the INUK       Innocence Project Protocols in 2008, which all INUK member innocence       projects are required to sign up to and work in accordance with.
The       Protocols were adapted from the model standards for live-client work that       govern associates of the Clinical Legal Education Organisation (CLEO) and       have been validated by the Attorney General's Pro Bono Protocols.
The       impact of this is the regulation of INUK's member innocence projects to       ensure quality in the assistance and client-care provided, as demonstrated       by the Annual Reports submitted by member innocence projects [e].
By       sharing his research and practical experience with INUK innocence       projects, Naughton has shaped their practices [f].
In particular, he has       instilled an `innocence-oriented' approach to the investigations by       innocence projects, which he found lacking in the criminal appeal system       and the CCRC [2] [3] [5].
This has been achieved through training       conferences and materials provided to innocence projects.
Since 2008       Naughton has organised eleven INUK national training conferences (two       conferences per year).
Consisting of high quality speakers including       lawyers, forensic scientists, representatives of the criminal justice       system and academics, the conferences enhance the knowledge of innocence       project staff and students on wrongful convictions so that they can make       better progress on their cases.
These conferences (which form the       principal training for student caseworkers) help innocence projects to       understand the inquisitorial, impartial investigative approach they should       adopt in their casework [g].
In addition, core support materials,       including the INUK Starter Pack, Handbook and First Steps document, were       devised by Naughton and are heavily based on his research [1] [2] [3] [h].
Raising awareness     (a) Raising awareness of the limitations of the Criminal Cases Review         Commission:     Naughton's research &#8212; especially [2] [5] [6] &#8212; and his leadership of INUK       have led to increased public awareness of the limitations of the CCRC in       assisting the innocent.
In December 2011, INUK launched its Joseph       Rowntree Reform Trust public campaign to reform the CCRC.
The campaign       involved a public symposium that brought together criminal appeal lawyers,       journalists, campaigners, former CCRC Commissioners, alleged miscarriages       of justice victims and academics.
In addition, INUK issued two public       statements on the limits of the CCRC and published a dossier of 44 `cases       for concern' that have been refused by the CCRC despite their possible       innocence.
Between January and May 2012, INUK's campaign generated five       feature articles in national media (Guardian, Times, BBC       News), seven articles in local newspapers and three articles in       professional magazines (Law Society Gazette; Lawyer 2B).
A       Report from the public symposium (printed by LexisNexis) was launched in       2012 and was part of Naughton's (with Tan) invited submission to the       Ministry of Justice's Triennial Review of the CCRC.
(b) Raising awareness of wrongful convictions in general: The       establishment of the CCRC resulted in reduced public and media interest in       wrongful convictions.
Naughton's research [2] [3] [5] and related work       with INUK has made a notable contribution to reigniting public and media       awareness on the issue of wrongful convictions generally.
Since 2008,       Naughton and INUK have been featured 47 times in national newspapers,       radio and TV interviews and currently (as of September 2013) generate over       42,600 hits on Google from diverse sources including the media, websites       of other universities, third-sector groups, and professional/commercial       bodies.

Influencing criminal justice policies internationally, including         avoiding potential harm     Naughton's research on the limitations of the CCRC [2] [5] [6] has led to       impact in Australia.
In 2011, Naughton was invited to consult with the       Parliament of South Australia in its Inquiry into the Australian CCRC Bill       2010, including a meeting with Hon.
Stephen Wade MLC, Shadow Attorney       General and Shadow Minister of Justice, who visited Naughton at the       University of Bristol in 2011.
Naughton's invited submissions &#8212; based on       [1] and [2] &#8212; were cited many times in the Legislative Committee's final       report published in 2012.
The Committee accepted Naughton's submission on       the limitations of a CCRC-style body and decided not to establish a body       based on that model in South Australia and/or nationally [i]: hence the       harm of adopting a UK approach that Naughton's research had demonstrated       is deeply flawed was avoided.
Naughton was also invited by the National       Institute of Justice of the US Dept of Justice to participate in a two day       workshop held in September 2010 to discuss best practices for preventing       and dealing with wrongful convictions and to determine their       transferability to the United States.
Naughton's research [3] [5] was       referred to several times in the final report by the US Dept of Justice       and helped to shape its agenda [j].
