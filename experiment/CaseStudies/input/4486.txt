     Through his research on statebuilding and on corruption, Zaum has become       a leading authority in       the field, who has been sought out by policymakers and practitioners.
Its       impact has been much       facilitated by his appointment in October 2011 to two public-sector       fellowships, initially held       simultaneously: the ESRC Public Sector Placement Fellowship held at the       Stabilisation Unit and       the Senior Research Fellowship held at DFID (the Stabilisation Unit is the       UK government's centre       for expertise and best practice in stabilisation, reporting to DFID, the       Ministry of Defence, and the       Foreign Office).
These fellowships have enabled him to engage directly       with these institutions on       corruption-related issues, especially in the context of fragile and       conflict-affected states.
They also       supplied the occasion for internal papers and presentations that have       shaped the way corruption is       discussed and understood among a wide range of British public servants.
The research has been disseminated among non-academics through at least       three different       channels:     1) The findings of the Carnegie-funded project on `Power after Peace'       have been widely presented       to policymakers and state-building practitioners.
In the UK alone, events       designed to publicise the       findings have included a large policy conference at Wilton Park in 2011;       two presentations at the       Foreign Office (one on the general findings in 2013, and one specifically       on implications of the       research for stabilising Libya in 2011); and one each at DFID, the       Stabilisation Unit (SU), and the       All-Party Parliamentary Group on Foreign Affairs.
Outside the UK, invited       presentations have been       given to policy audiences in the US (CSIS and State Department), Norway,       Sweden, and       Germany.
2) Zaum wrote two policy-oriented papers for the Stabilisation Unit on       corruption and stabilisation.
These papers have been circulated across Whitehall.
One of the SU papers       has been published on       the SU's website as a Stabilisation Issue Note in July 2012.
These       Issue Notes are substantial and       original papers reflecting the SU's understanding of the evidence and good       practice which `[draw]       on and amplify UK government policy and thinking on conflict'.
On the       basis of this work, the anti-corruption       resource centre U4 (which is supported by several leading donor agencies)       commissioned Zaum to write an additional briefing paper on corruption.
The       research has been       presented at the SU, DFID, the Land Intelligence Fusion Centre       Afghanistan, and the Royal       Military Academy Sandhurst.
3) Zaum led a research team writing a systematic appraisal of the       evidence on donor-funded anti-corruption       interventions for DFID, which showed that strong evidence of efficacy       existed for only 2       of the 22 interventions.
The findings of the anti-corruption evidence       appraisal have been formally       presented to policymakers and practitioners, especially in Whitehall.
The       presentations included a       large workshop with international partners and NGOs (including the World       Bank, UNDP, the       OECD/DAC, and Transparency International, the leading anti-corruption NGO       and research       institute) and a lecture to over 100 DFID conflict and governance advisors       at their professional       development conference (2012).
It has also included a large number of       smaller presentations to       policymakers and practitioners, such as members of the SU, DFID's Fragile       States and Conflict       team, the DFID Fraud and Anti-Corruption team, and Foreign Office       diplomats working in Latin       America.
The anti-corruption evidence appraisal has been peer reviewed and       published by the U4       in October 2012 as Mapping Evidence Gaps, enabling it to reach a       wider audience of practitioners.
The most immediate impact is that the research has informed and enriched       debates about       corruption in fragile and conflict-affected societies within both DFID and       the SU.
The impact       claimed is not that it has altered the basic principles of the UK's or       more specifically DFID's anti-corruption       policy: DFID officially has a `zero-tolerance' policy towards corruption;       this is neither       changed nor challenged by Zaum's research.
But his dissemination of his       analysis has had the       effect of altering perspectives by showing that corruption can contribute       to stabilising conflict-affected       states, even though this often comes at the price of entrenched injustice.
Anti-corruption       efforts that undermine these arrangements can therefore be destabilising,       and can fuel violence.
Evidence for the uptake of this research includes:            The popularity of the Stabilisation Issue Note.
The note has         been downloaded over 300 times         from the SU Website between September 2012 and February 2013, after         which the SU no         longer systematically recorded downloads.
This makes it one of the most         popular downloads         for this period.
The use of the note used by senior UK military officers in a NATO         conference on "Building         Integrity" in Monterey in February 2013 in a presentation on UK thinking         on the subject       Inclusion of the note in the reading pack prepared for DFID's         Governance and Conflict Advisors         Professional Development Conference in Leeds in December 2012.
Use of the note by the Transition Planning Team for the Helmand         Provincial Reconstruction         Team (PRT) in their post-2013 transition planning.
The transition         advisor to the head of the         PRT, Peter Rundell, confirmed that the paper `affected the way we in the         PRT...thought about         corruption and planned anti-corruption work'.
A presentation on the note to the Land Intelligence Fusion Centre         (Afghanistan), at a workshop         informing their planning and analysis of developments in Afghanistan         post-2013.
In the         judgement of the Centre's commander, Lt.Col.
Andrew Perrey, this helped         LIFC(A) `to view the         challenges relating to Afghanistan from a very different perspective         than their usual military         one'.
Continuing demand for similar work: at the end of the assessment         period Zaum was         commissioned to write a briefing Note for publication by U4 on         corruption in fragile and conflict-affected         states, and to present on the issue to senior military officers at the         Royal Defence         College in October 2013.
On the more specialised question of what works &#8212; and does not &#8212; in       anti-corruption, the Mapping         Evidence Gaps paper highlighted that there is strong evidence for       the effectiveness of only two       anti-corruption interventions: public financial management reforms; and       supreme audit institutions.
For the remaining 22 interventions, the evidence was either fair or weak,       or the findings were       contested.
For advisors who are developing anti-corruption programmes,       this constitutes important       evidence for their business cases.
Evidence of its impact includes:            The appearance of the paper in a list of top-12 readings for DFID         advisors on anti-corruption.
The use of the paper's findings to set the research agenda for a         proposed &#163;10 million DFID         operationally oriented research programme, to strengthen the evidence         base for its anti-corruption         interventions.
The use of the paper as background reading and in training sessions         for DFID country offices         for writing anti-corruption and counter-fraud strategies.
29 country         offices, which design and         manage development programmes, have now adopted such strategies.
Its popularity as a download from the U4 anti-corruption resource site         (www.u4.no), a donor-funded         resource centre not confined to UK government employees, suggests that         it is also         having a wider impact on corruption debates amongst researchers and         practitioners beyond         DFID.
Zaum has taken social-scientific findings informed by properly rigorous       comparative research to the       officials who have found them practically useful.
The immediate       beneficiaries have been DFID and       the SU, whose understanding of what works and what does not work in       anti-corruption, and of the       effect of corruption on stabilisation and state-building environments, has       improved.
As a result of       DFID's influential role and `thought leadership' on many development       issues, the benefits have       extended to other development and state-building actors, most strikingly       to soldiers based in       Afghanistan at several removes from Zaum himself.
As corruption is both a       key challenge to the       effectiveness of development and a key source of insecurity in any state       recovering from conflict, it       would be hard to exaggerate his impact's social value.
