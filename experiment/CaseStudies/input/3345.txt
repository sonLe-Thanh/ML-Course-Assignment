     ROTO&#1071; has transformed public views on the significance of contemporary       art and design and initiated change to local authority policy decisions to       provide cost-effective, high-quality cultural services.
It has also       generated practical models, best practice and further research on public       engagement strategies for partnerships between universities and cultural       sectors.
ROTO&#1071; I attracted more than 14,300 visitors.
Another 1,100 attended       related talks, interpretation tours, workshops, film screenings, reading       groups and other accompanying events designed to encourage further public       participation.
A number of methods were used to gauge the extent and       success of the engagement arising from each exhibition, including       questionnaires to gather quantitative feedback from visitors and gallery       staff; the devising and incorporation of relevant information systems;       evaluation reports; and workshops, both "in-house" and public, to assess       objectives and outcomes.
Feedback demonstrated how ROTO&#1071; increased access,       opportunity and understanding for a wider audience and shaped attitudes       and knowledge.
Hundreds of responses collected at Huddersfield Art Gallery indicated a       diverse range of ages (from as young as four) and nationalities (e.g.
French, American, Finnish, Irish) among visitors to the exhibitions [a].
This feedback also revealed different interpretations of content, the ways       in which visitors had been informed and inspired and how people's views of       the gallery and art in general had been changed.
Comments included "Lots       of wonderful inspiration to take away", "Amazing and thought-provoking",       "A revelation" and "Great work &#8212; might help me with my ambitions".
In an       online follow-up survey 60% of respondents said visiting the exhibitions       had changed their opinion about art and/or design, while 90% said they had       learnt something new [b].
Kimiyo Rickett, Assistant Director of Leisure       Services at Kirklees Council, has remarked: "ROTO&#1071;... has attracted new       audiences to the gallery and into the town centre.
It has allowed people       to engage with research outside of the academic institution and has       provided new opportunities for people to share in and understand the       School's research.
The exhibitions have been thought-provoking and       memorable."
[c] Ruth Gamble, Huddersfield Art Gallery Manager, states,       `The partnership's really important &#8212; we're very aware at the moment that       we don't want the Art Gallery to be...standing alone in Huddersfield.
We       want to be part of a bigger discussion about visual art, and involvement       and engagement...[ROTO&#1071;] meets a lot of our aims in terms of going       forward.'
[g]     ROTO&#1071; has also strengthened community links and benefited a range of       local organisations, such as the Workers' Educational Association.
Judith       Boardman, a tutor for Speakers of Other Languages with the WEA's Crosland       Moor branch, who led a group of multi-ethnic, adult learners on a visit to       a ROTO&#1071; exhibition, said: "[Before] they believed art was for other people       and not for them.
This was completely changed by the visit.
It was a       hugely successful trip and provoked lots of discussion... [which] further       enhanced learners' understanding of each other and helped cement       relationships of trust and respect."
[c] The group's experience was later       used as a topic for discussion in a functional skills speaking and       listening exam and was also shared with and praised by WEA regional and       national managers.
Other groups to have drawn on the ROTO&#1071; experience       include local performance dance group Turvey-World Dance, which       incorporated Sisyphus into two of its performances, and West       Yorkshire art and health organisation HOOT, which took inspiration from Sisyphus       for a workshop at the 2013 Grassington Festival and for work with people       with dementia [d].
ROTO&#1071; also collaborated with Kirklees Library to       disseminate exhibition content, leading to new book purchases and       increased lending.
Kirklees Library assistants have reported a 50% rise in       borrowing for the books selected for the ROTO&#1071; reading group, including       some that were rarely borrowed previously, noting: "[ROTO&#1071;] has been very       positive...
It brings the University into a different space."
[g]     ROTO&#1071; has provided further cultural enrichment by acting as a conduit for       bringing nationally and internationally commended work to Huddersfield and       West Yorkshire.
Sisyphus won the 7th International Arte       Laguna Prize, Venice, in March 2013, while Insufficient Allure       became a permanent exhibition (Behind the Seams) when it was       acquired by Leeds' Armley Industrial Museum following its ROTO&#1071;       appearance.
ROTO&#1071; exhibitions have been reviewed in ROTO&#1071; Review       by (among others) art historian Jonathan Harris, feminist art critic       Griselda Pollock and Art Monthly's Peter Suchin, as well as in       (among others) The Independent, The Guardian and Frieze       [h].
Online surveys have shown ROTO&#1071; has strongly influenced views about       local culture, with visitors' comments including "It's more cutting-edge       than I had realised", "My ideas about its role in Huddersfield have       changed" and "[ROTO&#1071;] makes [the work] relevant to the broader public in       terms of cultural ownership" [b].
Rickett has noted: "We have a       huge number of creative industries [which] can benefit enormously from       having an interaction with the University.
ROTO&#1071; helps to make that       connection and bring the work out to those people."
[c]     Drawing on the ROTO&#1071; experience, in May 2013 the School organised a       symposium at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts to examine       methodologies of measuring public engagement to inspire new audiences and       practitioners via cost-effective public services [i].
Speakers at the       event, entitled Public Engagement and Impact: Articulating Value in         Art and Design, included Dr Claire Donovan, Reader in Assessing       Research Impact at Brunel University; Dr Sarah Shalgosky, Curator of the       Mead Gallery at the University of Warwick; Peter Murray CBE, Executive       Director of Yorkshire Sculpture Park; and Dr Paul Manners, Director of the       National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement.
Some 80% of delegates,       including artists, academics, cultural researchers and representatives of       national and international art venues, recognised a change in their       understanding of "public engagement".
The related Engage website       attracted more than a thousand visits from 17 countries, while the ROTO&#1071;       weblog has received more than 4,000 visits from over 50 countries [j].
Dr       James Harvey, a research impact specialist at consultancy CommsConsult       Ltd, used ROTO&#1071; as a case study for an article on the Research to Action       website as an exemplar case study for other organisations involved in       partnerships.
