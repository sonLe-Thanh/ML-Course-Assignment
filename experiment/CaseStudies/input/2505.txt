Improved provision of environmental services in Belize     Pathway: Darwin Initiative grants require that the research should       create information and       resources that will have lasting impact in the host country.
The project       described here directly       influenced the creation in late 2009 of a new Environmental Research       Institute (ERI) at the UB       (http://www.eriub.org/), including       research funding from the project enabling the appointment of       foundation staff, as corroborated in a letter from the Terrestrial Science       Director of the ERI [A].
The       created plant reference collections and identification services run by the       Ministry of Natural       Resources and a database of savanna plants are now used by both the       Belizean government and       NGOs in environmental monitoring and land management.
In 2012, Belize       Tropical Forest Studies       used the mapping produced by the Darwin Initiative to revise the National       Ecosystems Map of       Belize, which now forms part of UNESCO's land cover map for Central       America, as corroborated in       a letter from the Director of Belize Tropical Forest Studies [B].
Local staff members trained by UK       scientists have taken up specialist roles in environmental monitoring /       consulting services to       government and NGOs.
Significance and reach:            The ERI, the Ministry of Natural Resources and environmental NGOs         based in Belize now         conduct biodiversity monitoring work of enhanced quality as a result of         the comprehensive         databases, mapping, plant reference collections (such as updating the         Belize National         Herbarium in the Forest Department, Belmopan) and well-trained staff         that have resulted         from the Darwin Initiative research, as stated in letters from the         Terrestrial Science Director         of the ERI [A] and the Director of Belize Tropical Forest         Studies [B].
Corroboration that         these research-derived improvements constituted a "step-change in the         quality of services         for plant identification and biodiversity monitoring" carried out by         both NGOs and the         Government of Belize is provided in a letter from an independent         botanical expert, the         Regius Keeper of the RBGE [C].
The then British High         Commissioner to Belize can provide         corroboration that the Government has been better able to fulfil         monitoring and reporting         commitments, such as those to the UN, to protect plant diversity [D].
The embedding of the research into the UNESCO land-cover map (the         standard reference         for land-use planning / management organisations within Belize) has         informed the         Government's 2012 National Land Use Policy and Planning Framework, as         corroborated in         a letter from the Director of Belize Tropical Forest Studies [B].
Further information on the         use of the savanna map by Belize Tropical Forest Studies and its         integration into policy can         be found on pages 2, 4, 7, 13 and 15 of the Grant Final Report cited in         Section 3.
A 2011 consultative workshop organised by the ERI on the findings of         the Darwin Initiative         work was attended by 30 stakeholders, representing all the key         government Ministries and         NGOs in Belize and led to a policy briefing to the Ministry of Natural         Resources and the         National Protected Areas Secretariat [E].
Since 2009 UK researchers have trained more than 40 Belize-based         environmental         services professionals (30 person-weeks of training), across the         majority of conservation         organisations in Belize, as corroborated by the ERI Terrestrial Science         Director [A] and ERI         annual reports [F].
Public engagement with, and understanding of, Belizean biodiversity     Pathway: Charitable organisations in Belize, such as Belize Zoo       and Belize Botanic Gardens have       used the research in public engagement activities.
This includes the 2011       establishment of a       Savanna Trail and Educational Classroom at the Botanic Gardens [G]       and the use by the Zoo of       research materials to design interpretative signs and guide books for a       $30k investment into       educational facilities [H].
Significance and reach: Since 2011, with support from the Ministry       of Education, Belize Botanic       Gardens have organised school visits by over 1,600 children and 90       teachers to the Savanna Trail       [G].
Furthermore, over 1,000 copies of a children's board game with       content traceable to the       research have been purchased by primary schools [G].
With over       50,000 visitors last year (10,000       of which by schoolchildren), the Zoo is the most popular visitor       attraction in Belize and the Darwin       Initiative research is now central to the self-sustaining public       engagement initiatives at the national       Zoo promoting savanna conservation [H].
