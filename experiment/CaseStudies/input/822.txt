     PATHWAY TO IMPACT       Protein stability studies are essential in the biopharmaceutical industry       to identify suitable       candidate product formulations and eliminate the costs associated with the       development (and later       failure) of unstable molecules.
Smith and Radford quickly       realised that their T-jump and T-mixer       devices for heating and mixing small quantities of proteins with       simultaneous spectroscopic       monitoring (described in [3]) of denaturation had significant commercial       potential as an analytical       tool for early stage biopharmaceutical R&amp;D.     Avacta was formed in 2004 as a spin-off company from the research       described above [A].
It       subsequently raised raised &#163;1.0m through its AIM listing in 2006, with a       further &#163;2.7m generated in       a placing of ordinary shares in 2007 [B].
Dr Alastair Smith was       the founding CEO of Avacta and       still is, transferring his leadership and expertise from the University of       Leeds into the business       sector.
IMPACT DURING THE REF PERIOD     Between 2005 and 2009 Avacta further developed the unique rapid       temperature switching and T       mixer technologies.
The Optim1000 platform for high throughput,       micro-volume protein stability       analysis was launched in April 2009.
Towards the end of the REF Impact       Period the Optim 1000       was been replaced with an improved product, the Optim 2.
Saving biopharma time and money and reducing risk     Optim1000 has allowed biopharmaceutical researchers to analyse the       effects of temperature, time       and the chemical environment on small quantities of biomolecule with high       throughput.
Optim1000       could analyse up to 96 samples in a working day, using only 9&#181;l sample       volumes (as little as 0.1&#181;g       protein [D]).
The Optim 2 can analyse up to 48 temperature controlled       samples simultaneously,       with an increase to 144 samples per day and has retained the `best in       class' sample volume (9&#181;l)       of the Optim 1000 [C].
Studies have shown that even the previous Optim1000 technology "is at       least fifty times faster and       consumes significantly less protein than alternative technologies to       obtain the same information."
[D].
The requirement for less protein sample material also allows       laboratories to perform stability       studies much earlier in the R&amp;D process, reducing waste in reagents       and resource and the costs of       scaling up production to generate sufficient quantities of sample for       analysis.
Optim1000 and now       Optim 2 marketing asserts that the early analysis facilitated by the       system "eliminates the cost         associated with the unnecessary development of candidates or         formulations that do not have the         potential to proceed and dramatically reduces the chance of late-stage         failure."
[C].
Clear evidence of the rapid sample screening advantages of Optim       technology is given in the       customer testimonies [J].
For example, Royal DSM state "With the Optim         we simply get answers         more quickly with far less effort.
We test large numbers of         formulations, screening many variants to         get a new stable end product and can pick the top three to take ahead to         more in-depth real-time         stability studies.
Eliminating the poor candidates very early in the         process saves us so much time."
Besides time (and thus cost saving), another very important impact of       Optim technology is the       reduction of risk in a drug development programme, as highlighted by       Syntaxin Ltd [J]: "The Optim         1000 fluorescence and light-scattering instrument provides data-rich         analysis using very small         amounts of material.
The low sample requirement &#8212; &lt;320 mg of material         were used for the entire         SXN101959 TSI study &#8212; enabled Syntaxin to rapidly screen a number of         different formulations.
Because more formulations could be studied early in development of this         drug, and unsuitable         formulations could be discarded, risk was reduced for this development         program."
Sales of Optim1000 units have grown steadily since product launch in       2009; 21 units were shipped       in the year 2011-12 (compared with 14 in 2010-11) [H], contributing to a       59% increase in revenue.
The company has global reach with operations in all in major geographies       [A].
Avacta indicates       that many of the top global biopharmaceutical R&amp;D companies use Optim       technology in their R&amp;D       cycle, demonstrating the wide acceptance and reach of the technology.
A conservative estimate of the economic impact that Optim technology       enables in the       pharmaceutical industry worldwide can be calculated from current annual       sales figures of the       leading biopharmaceutical product Humira which reported annual sales of       $7.9bn in 2011 [I].
Assuming that Optim technology screening had saved Abbott one month in       development time (thus       increasing the drug's patent exclusivity period by one month), the company       could expect an       additional ca.
$650m in Humira sales before patent expiry.
Taking a       conservative five-fold scaling       factor for the impact of Optim technology across the industry, this       technology can be estimated to       be worth $3.2 bn in increased sales to the industry.
This is simply       considering drug sales; clearly       additional economic impact is also derived from R&amp;D cost savings,       though these are harder to       quantify in absolute terms.
Revenue growth and jobs     Since its creation in 2005 Avacta has experienced significant growth       through increased sales and       acquisitions.
In October 2012 the company reported annual revenue over       &#163;3M, an increase of 28%       from 2011.
Sales of Optim1000 increased by 59% from 14 units in 2011 to 21       units in 2012.
The       company's workforce has grown to its current figure of 70 staff [A].
In September 2012 Avacta signed a deal with the global filtration company       Pall Corporation, which       will allow Pall Corp to sell Optim1000 into the Indian drug development       market, following previous       deals to target North America and South East Asia [E, F].
This       breakthrough supports the future       growth of Avacta and its entry into key new biopharmaceutical markets.
Supporting research     Avacta also runs an analytical contract service which supports       biopharmaceutical R&amp;D and       fundamental protein stability and kinetic studies serving large       pharmaceutical, smaller biotechs and       universities [G].
This service contributes to the research of these       clients and widens the scope for       future benefits and impact based on Avacta technology [A].
This contract       service contributes a       steady annual income of around &#163;200,000 to the company [H].
