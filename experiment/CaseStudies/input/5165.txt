     Since its launch in 2008 on the Futures Institute website,5.1       LiST has been adopted as a policy and decision-making tool by a wide range       of international agencies and organisations, governments, NGOs and others.5.2     The Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia       (GAPP), published by WHO and UNICEF in 2009, called for the increased use       of interventions of proven benefit and provided guidance on how this could       be done, using LiST to estimate the deaths due to pneumonia that could be       prevented by scaling-up different interventions.5.3     In November 2009, the science academies of seven sub-Saharan African       countries launched a seminal report, Science in Action: Saving the         Lives of Africa's Mothers, Newborns, and Children.
A call to action       for African policy-makers, the report encouraged them to work with       scientists to make the most efficient changes to their health care       systems.
The report makes extensive reference to LiST and its use in       preparing its findings.5.4     The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation used LiST to underpin their       Impatient Optimist scheme (November 2009) and their Vaccine Delivery       Strategy (January 2010).
Save the Children employed the tool in the       preparation of their Missing Midwives report (2011) to show that       1.3 million newborns annually could be saved using eight key       interventions.5.5     Born Too Soon: The Global Action Report on Preterm Birth, produced       in May 2012 by WHO, Save the Children, March of Dimes (an NGO that works       to improve the health of mothers and babies) and The Partnership for       Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health, with 50 partner organisations, used       LiST to identify priority packages and interventions for preterm babies.5.6       This initiative achieved wide media coverage, including reports in The         Guardian, Reuters and on the BBC in the UK, and in the New York         Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal in the USA.
A       global relay on Twitter reached nearly 6.5 million users.
The UN Commission on Life Saving Commodities for Women and Children used       LiST in 2012 to estimate how many maternal and child lives could be saved       by different commodities.5.7     Other international users of LiST include the Pan-American Health       Organisation (PAHO), the GAVI Alliance, which exists to bring life-saving       vaccines to children in developing countries, and the Global Fund to Fight       AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; bilateral agencies including DFID, USAID,       the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the Norwegian       Agency for Development Cooperation; as well as large NGOs and foundations       including PSI, World Vision, the Clinton Foundation, and the Children's       Investment Fund Foundation.
At national and regional level, LiST has been used in the following ways.
The 2010 Evaluation of Malawi's Emergency Human Resources Programme         used LiST to analyse four indicators against which to measure increases         in utilisation in priority health services; as the report states, the         result was over 13,000 lives saved due to increased coverage of these         indicators.5.8        Two editions of Nigeria's national government report, Saving           Newborn Lives in Nigeria (2009 and 2011) used LiST analyses.5.9         The second report was linked to the addition of a line in the national         health budget for newborn health care.
Other individual countries that have used LiST to devise strategies to         save the lives of newborns have included Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Uganda,         India (several states) and China.
The Lancet Stillbirth series used LiST in 2011 to estimate         stillbirths averted with various packages of care, and the linked         maternal and newborn lives saved.
In many of the examples mentioned, decisions based on LiST have       ultimately benefited newborns and children of families in low- and       middle-income countries by giving them increased access to life-saving       interventions.
Jeremy Shiffman, Associate Professor of Public Administration and Policy       at American University, examined the increased attention being paid to       newborn survival in his paper in The Lancet in 2010.5.10       He categorised this increase as `surprising: there was no sudden increase       in the number of babies dying or swift spread of a virus that alarmed       citizens of rich countries'.
He concluded that The Lancet Neonatal       Survival series 2005, to which Cousens and colleagues had contributed       vital research, was important in solidifying links between key individuals       in the field and became `a point of reference on the severity, causes,       costing, and solutions to the problem of newborn mortality and had       substantial influence in agenda setting'.
