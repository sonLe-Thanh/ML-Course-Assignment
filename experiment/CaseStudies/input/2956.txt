     Context     During the period 2000-2005 ongoing research was conducted and       excavations at Barnhouse and       Maeshowe were brought to publication (3.2).
In 2013 the Cuween-Wideford       landscape project,       where six new Neolithic settlements were investigated, was completed.
The       Great Stone Circles       Project (2001-12) fieldwork was brought to publication in 2013 (3.3).
Pathways to impact     Having been presented in local, national and international academic       conferences and published in       a range of outlets ranging from a leading monograph series (McDonald       Institute) to the Orcadian       Newspaper, the research has led to museum displays, exhibitions, local       lectures, radio and       television presentations.
Richards' research also informs the       interpretation and presentation of       Orcadian WHS though Historic Scotland books (e.g.
Maeshowe, Heart of       Neolithic Ork), guide       books and web sites (e.g.
`orkneyjar').
Reach and significance     The mechanism of impact is through a prolonged period of activity that       falls into four areas:            Enhancing tourism and enriching visitor experience.
Contributing to the awarding of World Heritage listed status to the         archaeological sites         constituting the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage         landscape.
Providing expert evidence for use in the Merranblo wind-farm inquiry.
Impact on public discourse of the Orcadian archaeological heritage.
Outcomes of the research responsible for the first two areas of impact       are: first, the reconstruction       and presentation of the Neolithic settlement of Barnhouse (Richards 2005).
This has a direct       impact on tourism (e.g.
70,000 per annum) [5.6 &amp; 5.10].
Elements of Richards' field project (Barnhouse and Maeshowe) underpinned       the successful award       of UNESCO World Heritage listed status for the series of sites that form the           Heart of Neolithic           Orkney (see 3.2, 3.4, 3.5) [5.8].
Subsequently, Richards has       taken a key advisory role in the public       interpretation and presentation of the World Heritage monuments, and his       research features       heavily in Historic Scotland Ranger training, guide books and       interpretation panels [5.10].
Further       impact of research on heritage presentation and interpretation was       achieved through membership       of the UNESCO WHS research committee (2000-13).
In this capacity Richards       has provided a       leading role in determining the research priorities and presentational       components of the Heart of         Neolithic Orkney WHS [5.10].
The third area of impact is the utilization of Richards' research as key       evidence in the Merranblo       windfarm inquiry, held in Stromness (January 2008) [5.2, 5.3 and 5.7].
The       proposed development       was to be positioned on a hilltop overlooking the WHS.
Richards research       on the relationship       between landscape and monuments in the WHS provided pivotal evidence       against the       development, particularly in the context of `setting', `the definition         of `setting'... was a central         question considered by the inquiry', and `this is where Richards'         research proved crucial, because         the windfarm development team proposed an entirely different notion of         `setting' with alternative         criteria' (ibid) [5.2].
Richards was to be the archaeological expert witness, (but was       undertaking fieldwork on Easter       Island), The Lecturer in Archaeology at the University of Glasgow assumed       this role and drawing       on Richards' research argued the case against the development, `There         is no doubt in my mind         that the research and theories developed by Prof Richards.... played a         fundamental role in the final         decision of the Reporter' [5.3].
This judgement also provided the       basis for a new OIC Planning       Policy concerning wind-farm development in Orkney [5.5].
The final impact concerns public discourse.
Throughout the period of       research Richards has given       regular public lectures throughout Europe and across Orkney.
Also,       numerous radio (local BBC       and national BBC &#8212; Radio 4) and television broadcasts on Orcadian       archaeology.
This is       supplemented by numerous columns [5.9] in the Orcadian, `the         research has involved sustained         collaboration with the local media, archaeological groups and the Orkney         public in general &#8212; to         date, he has written six articles and been a contributor to over 40 in         the past decade' [5.1].
As a       policy, Richards has always worked with local museums and communities, `from         the start Richards         viewed his excavations as work within the community which should always         involve local people       [5.4], `Professor Richards' keenness to share his knowledge with the         people of Orkney was, and         remains, clearly evident in his willingness to engage with the local         community' [5.1].
Growing local       appreciation of archaeological heritage is more difficult to define or       quantify.
One measure is the       instigation of archaeological funding by OIC who award &#163;40,000 annually An       increase in       awareness also translates into a more educated public who feel they have a       vested interest in their       own heritage.
Again this can be measured in the proportional increase of       discovered       archaeological sites reported to the Regional Archaeologist [5.5].
Another       measure is community       involvement in archaeological projects to such an extent that stakeholders       (e.g.
local farmers)       actually provide funds for C14 dates.
Overall, Richards' research has had       a huge effect on the       local awareness of heritage and its presentation and cultural value.
