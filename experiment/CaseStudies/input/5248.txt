     The research conducted at Kingston served to inform architects and       providers of health and long-term care environments for those with neural       disabilities, who have incorporated design principles and guidance on post       occupancy evaluation drawn from the research into their work.
This has       resulted in the successful design, redesign or refurbishment of many care       facilities, including five within the REF census period, which have       improved the well-being of service users, patients and staff.
This impact has been achieved through Dalke acting as design consultant       for architectural firms, individual NHS hospitals, mental health units,       care homes and independent charities as well as healthcare furniture and       equipment suppliers such as Hill-Rom.
All of these organisations have       benefitted from Dalke's evidence-based research on colour design       interventions, relevant interior colour design schemes, visuals, layout       and the redesign of exterior entrances and ward corridors.
Her design       approaches have positively affected staff and visitors, as well as       improving the behaviour and well-being of users with neural disabilities.
Specific projects which have benefited from Dalke's consultancy during       the period 2008-2013 include the following:     2008: St Luke's mental health unit, Middlesbrough.
A leisure hall refurbishment on which Dalke advised was highly praised as       effective by staff and patients.
Following the refurbishment, the hall had       much greater use by both patients and staff, and this increased use of the       hall helped to promote the improved inpatient facilities at Roseberry Park       Hospital.
"The Hall was well received and our previous Chief Executive Mrs M         Brittan MBE helped us enormously to promote the good use of the         facility."
[1]     2009: Amy Woodgate House, Chessington, Surrey     Lead designers Dunlop Haywards contracted Dalke as a Colour Consultant to       collaborate in providing a new flagship facility to replace a residential       care home for people with dementia.
The new building provided 40       residential units and 30 day care places for dementia sufferers, and a       respite facility for four people.
The design drew on Dalke's research to       provide colour palettes that would allow for "controlled wandering" and       avoid confusion for residents with visual impairments and dementia.
"The consultation with you as a colour expert enriched the design and         added to the success of the scheme."
[2]     2009-10: Age Concern Day Centre, New Malden     Dalke advised on a substantial refurbishment of patient facilities,       including new colour schemes for the main lounge area and a complete       redesign of the craft room which incorporated Dalke's research into the       use and effect of fragrance.
This led to a formerly neglected area being       productively used, making a contribution to the well-being of users on a       daily basis.
"people living with dementia can be supported in the community for         much longer if they have access to universal services such as Raleigh         House ... to which you have already contributed so much."
[3]     2012: Columbia Ward, Mile End Hospital, East London     Dalke advised Sonnemann Toon Architects on the redevelopment of a       hospital ward for people suffering from dementia and memory impairment.
Her work related to the colour, visuals, layout and re-design of the male       and female ward areas.
The NHS National Clinical Director for Dementia       unveiled a plaque to commemorate the redeveloped ward, and rated the       impact of this project as significant, noting:     "Improving the environment for people with dementia and memory         impairment is a key challenge for health services and we know that         improving the environment can improve outcomes for people with dementia.
The group [DRC] are to be congratulated on making a significant         contribution to this area."
[4].
Sonnemann Toon were specifically directed by the NHS to employ Dalke on       this refurbishment project, and observed a year later:     "The ward has just passed its first 12 months in operation and has         been a great success for the East London NHS Foundation Trust, who         received many favourable comments on the atmosphere and quality of the         ward from professionals, families and of course patients."
