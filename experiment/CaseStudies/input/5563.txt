     Emerging in parallel and in response to the growing influence of the       Bologna Accord on Higher Education and the increasing impact of       neo-liberalism on education in the Arts and Humanities, the educational         turn has brought these pressing issues to public spheres outside the       university and to engage audiences from the arts and from public       organisations in these debates.
The published research and the exhibitions       and public forums organised in tandem, have enabled greater public       recognition of the issues emanating from education.
Rogoff`s seminal 2008 essay `Turning' was published in the       inaugural issue of on-line art journal e-flux which is accessed by       all major museums and read by around 90,000 art world professionals.
Here       she raised for such professionals the question of what an educational turn       might comprise, and asked in what spaces and discourses it might take       place.
She suggested that the art world would be a prime host for such a       `turn', being an informal, open network which is hospitable to       experimentation and speculative thought, and open to thinking of       `learning' as taking place in non-traditional situations.
She argued that       exhibiting institutions and art practice itself can become sites of       education, self-reflexion, and self-constitution.
The level of interest       and response this elicited is evidenced by the fact that the essay has       subsequently been translated into 11 languages and widely anthologised and       syndicated.
[1] In 2010, e-flux invited Rogoff to       be Guest Editor of a special issue which laid down the vision and agenda       for actualising a type of education without borders and is e-flux's       most-read edition ever.
Rogoff has stimulated wider interest in the educational turn by speaking       at numerous events for non-academic audiences, especially art museum       educators.
A high profile example was a public lecture at the Hayward       Gallery's event Deschooling Society, a collaboration with the       Serpentine Gallery and The Museum of Modern Art, New York.
This       presentation is available as a podcast on the Hayward gallery blog.
[2]       She gave numerous talks between 2010-12 at international events open to       the public, including:            `The Academy Strikes Back', organised and hosted at the Brussels         University College of Art and Design by the European Artistic Research         Network.

[3b]        `Learning from the Future", a major five-day programme at the Vienna         Kunst Historisches Museum and SITAC Mexico City (2012) [two talks][3c]        Art Network for Creative Radical Pedagogy (2012) supported by         Bucharest Erste Bank.
CAVIC-symposium keynote lecture, Stockholm University of Art and         Design (Nov 2010).
CAVIC is the Nordic network of art education         including researchers within the fields of art and design education,         arts based education, museum education etc.
Participating countries are         Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Lithuania, Latvia and         Estonia.
[3d]           She has also spoken at a British Council event in Athens (2010) asking       artists, critics, and a wider audience what it means to take part in       culture; and in 2012 she gave a lecture on the notion of the `open       academy' to a wide audience at the Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw.
The most recent Educational Turn initiative has been the formation of freethought:       a collective of scholars, artists and urbanists who have founded a       platform for the generation of research pedagogy and production in public       spaces.
It was initially launched as a 3-day event with performance       presentations and panels on "Crisis education", "Crisis Economies" and       "Creative Strikes"[4] run by Rogoff at the 2012 Truth         is Concrete festival in Graz, Austria.
This `marathon' festival       attracts a large international audience, with events 24 hours a day across       a whole week by more than 200 artists, activists and theorists who       lecture, perform, and discuss art and politics.
Rogoff was invited to       curate freethought as a strand of the final event of the 5 year       "Former West" project which took place at the House of World Cultures in       Berlin, an international contemporary arts centre whose mission is to       offer visitors "opportunities to grapple with the conflicts, challenges       and questions of our time".
This event launched freethought's new       project on `infrastructure' which will extend over the next 3 years.
[5]       Speaking to audiences of some 800 in Berlin over 3 days and streamed live       on the net to several thousand others, a panel tackled the question of       whether `infrastructure' can be thought as part of critical creativity       rather than the efficient delivery of resources and supports for such       creativity.
From its European beginnings, freethought has now been picked up       by the Asia Cultural Complex in South Korea, funded by the Ministry of       Culture and Education.
It has established a three-year (2013-16)       laboratory on `infrastructure', which aims to find new public formats for       `the educational turn' hosted by this new large-scale national and       regional cultural complex that includes all forms of creative practice;       music, art, theatre, dance, and discourse.
The laboratory will produce a       large scale installation piece for the official opening of the museum in       2015.
