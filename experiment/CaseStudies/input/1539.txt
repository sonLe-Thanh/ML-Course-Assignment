     The 'Booster' trial research confirmed the efficacy of a DVD intervention       to promote physical activity in sedentary individuals in deprived areas.
This research evidence led Drs Copeland and Crank to produce another DVD       intervention as part of a Barnsley NHS/local authority commissioned       service in 2009 (grant b).
The service &#8212; 'Be Active' (designed, delivered       and project managed by SHU staff &#8212; Copeland and Crank) &#8212; represented a       community based behaviour change intervention to increase physical       activity in overweight individuals and their families in nine of the most       deprived areas of Barnsley.
Barnsley has been identified as a borough of       poor health with 34% (67,000 individuals) of the adult population       estimated to be overweight and a further 73,000 obese.
Furthermore, the       2008/9 Active People Survey ranked Barnsley in the bottom 25% nationally       for participation in regular activity.
The primary objective of 'Be Active' was to increase the physical       activity of overweight adults and to reduce their cardiovascular risk.
A       total of 7,206 individuals from 4,815 households in the most deprived       areas of Barnsley received a copy of the DVD.
According to a senior       officer at Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council (MBC) (source i below) "this         was a considerable achievement, bearing in mind that all of these people         were considered to be hard to reach".
Of all participants, 72% were       female and the mean age of recipients was 38 years.
The impact of the DVD       was assessed as part of an overall service evaluation conducted by SHU       (see end of section for reference).
In sum, 92% of individuals self-reported watching the DVD, of whom 93%       confirmed they were more active as a result.
Data also revealed a       significant and beneficial effect over time of the programme, for weight       (p=0.001), BMI (p=0.001), waist circumference (p=0.001) and blood pressure       (systolic: p=0.001 and diastolic p=0.003).
In real terms this equates to a       mean weight loss per person of 3kg, a reduction in waist circumference of       over 4cm, and a fall in BMI of 0.95units.
Importantly, the 'Be Active'       data is also based on a relatively long term follow-up (6 months).
A       senior manager from Small Changes Ltd (source ii) who also delivers weight       management services in Barnsley reported "the long-term changes noted         in the data are encouraging and underline the impact of the DVD on the         maintainance of behavioural changes made by participants.
Sustained         change is likely to have a positive and lasting impact on the health         profile of some of the most challenging areas of Barnsley".
Case       studies from the programme can be seen at http://beactive.org.uk/case-studies/       along with other `active ingredients' from the DVD which has been       translated into an on-line format and embedded within Barnsley MBC's       leisure services programme (see          www.beactive.org.uk).
This work was also undertaken by Copeland and       Crank and has enhanced the reach and sustainability of the intervention.
In broader terms, data from Sport England's Active People Survey       highlight the contribution 'Be Active' made towards adult physical       activity participation in Barnsley.
The data for Barnsley showed an       increase from 19.1% to 22.4% of adults participating in 3 x 30 minutes       physical activity per week (National Indicator 8 &#8212; Change between APS1       (Oct05-Oct 06) and APS4/5 (Oct 09-Oct 11)).
To strengthen this evidence,       trend data from Department of Health (2011) taken between 2009 and 2011       (the time period of 'Be Active') confirms physical activity in adults       increased from 8.3% to 12.1%.
This places Barnsley above the national       average for the first time.
Whilst causal links between physical activity       increases in Barnsley and `Be Active' must be treated with caution (in       that we did not control for extraneous variables within the research       design), the data is nevertheless encouraging.
Moreover, as inferred by       the testimony above from the senior officer at Barnsley MBC (source i       below), the DVD approach had a positive and significant impact on the       reach of local service providers (i.e.
NHS Barnsley, Active Barnsley,       Barnsley FC, Barnsley MBC) by providing each of these with an       evidence-based `behaviour change tool' to engage typically hard-to-reach       communities.
In doing so `Be Active' supported the aforementioned agencies       to meet health improvement targets specified within Department of Health,       local NHS and Public Health England outcome frameworks.
This impact is further corroborated by a Senior Health Improvement       Specialist from Barnsley MBC (Source iii below) who suggested "the Be         Active programme not only demonstrated a significant impact on those who         were in receipt of the programme (in terms of their health profile) but         also on those who are connected to the delivery of physical activity         services across Barnsley.
I can say with confidence that introducing an         evidence-based approach to engendering physical activity behaviour         change through the DVD, positively influenced the culture of provision         in the Borough as well as framing policy decisions and commissioning         approaches moving forwards.
Providers and commissioners of services in         Barnsley are working differently as a result of `Be Active' and this is         one of the key achievements of the programme".
The impact of the research informing the 'Be Active' DVD also has a       broader reach, driven by the following:            Publication in a practice-based journal with a circulation list of         5,500 (Copeland, R.J., Crank, H, Hall, A., &amp; Millbourn.
