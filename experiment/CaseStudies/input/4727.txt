     International level            The researcher was invited by Archbishop of Canterbury to the on-going         Building Bridges Seminar series (2010 onwards) between Muslims and         Christians.
The 2010 opening day aimed at public dissemination [f].
The         researcher participated in the panel debate `Religion and Modernity in         Christianity and Islam', chaired by the Archbishop (2010), which has had         more than 3,000 hits.
The Archbishop's Special Advisor on Islam (ASAI)         comments that the researcher is a `real conduit between the academic         research community and popular teaching and dissemination' [c].
As a result, the researcher then worked with ASAI in four ecumenical         consultations on Christian attitudes to Muslims: Georgetown/Campion         Hall, Oxford Seminars (2010-11).
These meetings provided a major         resource for Christian clergy, internationally and nationally, to engage         with Islam [g].
The researcher's findings were presented at Lambeth         Palace (2012) to Christian policy makers in Muslim-Christian matters.
The researcher's work was discussed outside the academy in blogs, more         than 30 in 2012 alone.
These include a three-part US blog, `Those who         never hear the gospel' discussing [1], with 162 exchanges [j], and three         separate blogs discussing [4], in two of which &#8212; `In Christ Alone' and         'The Myth of Religious Superiority' &#8212; there are 129 exchanges.
In 2010,         the researcher's work was discussed in an atheist forum, `Dangerous         Arrogance: the Catholic Church must stop dehumanizing atheists', which         attracted 52 exchanges.
National level &#8212; UK            The researcher's work on theology of religion and typologies [1], [3]         is recommended reading for the OCR Exam Board, A level GCE A2 module,         `Theology of Religions'.
The researcher's earlier work has been on the         syllabus now for ten years.
OCR is Europe's largest assessment agency         and operates in over 150 countries [e].
The Chief Examiner of OCR         comments: `Professor D'Costa's recent books are recommended reading and         good candidates are clearly benefitting from reading his books either by         directly referring to him in their exam papers or indirectly through         their critique of the traditional paradigm which is indebted to his         analysis.'
[e]       Besides impact on schools, the researcher's work has impacted upon the         national Catholic Church.
The researcher acts as an adviser to the         Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, Commission for Other         Faiths primarily through the Interreligious Adviser to the Catholic         Bishops' Conference (CBC).
His research expertise was used to support         the CBC Interreligious Adviser on the UK Papal visit (2010),         specifically the meeting of faith leaders (Twickenham), and the         Westminster address (Westminster, London).
The researcher made e-media         outputs on both events for the general public through the Clifton         Diocese website [i], ensuring impact on the UK Catholic population in         understanding their Church's teachings and social attitudes.
The CBC         Interreligious Adviser claims that the researcher has `helped shape the         national line on these questions, and to avoid pitfalls in dialogue'         especially in relation to interfaith prayer and the Catholic         contribution to pluralist culture [b].
The CBC Interreligious Adviser         notes that the researcher's advice to the Archbishop overseeing         interfaith matters has `informed and benefitted his work nationally and         internationally' specifically in relation to Jewish relations and         interfaith prayer [b].
The researcher's work has also impacted on the wider UK Christian         community.
The national conference of `Churches Together in Britain and         Ireland' (Swanick, 2010) invited Archbishop Vincent Nichols and the         researcher as keynote speakers on `Church in the Public Square'.
The CBC         Interreligious Adviser testifies that the researcher's input to this         event `shaped the discussions of the Interreligious Network UK' on this         theme [b].
300 delegates attended and the talk was disseminated widely         [h].
Local &#8212; Avon            The researcher acts as adviser and resource to the Clifton Diocese         Interfaith Officer (CDIO), (2000-13) and to the Clifton Diocese Director         of Adult Education (CDDAE).
Impact has occurred in five areas of         disseminating research: (i) training in the education of priests; (ii)         training and educating deacons; (iii) educating catechists within the         Clifton Diocese; (iv) teaching lay people; (v) the production of videos         and podcasts for the Diocese website with a view to a much greater         audience than the church going communities of Clifton [i].
CDIO claims the researcher's work helped in the `innovation of digital         media to disseminate and explain Church teachings' and `ensured a         positive relationship between the Catholic community and people of other         faiths within the diocese', and that the researcher helped `to         facilitate positive engagement between Catholics and Muslims through         local media, including BBC Radio Bristol and The Bristol Post'         [d].
The researcher's work has informed `policy changes and policy         thinking within the Clifton Diocese' [d].
CDDAE adds of the researcher's         impact on priests and deacons, of those that `might be called "policy"         makers...
I am confident that their interaction with [the researcher]         has helped when considering policy about catechesis, doctrine, and         possibly in their own preaching methods' [a].
