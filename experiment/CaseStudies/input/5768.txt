     Diamond has collaborated with a range of beneficiaries who have drawn on       her research as a way of engaging the public's interest in the period       allowing Diamond to impact on English speaking audiences globally, across       Europe, the US and Australasia through a variety of mediums.
In June 2013,       Fleeing Hitler had sold close to 10,000 copies, mostly overseas,       largely in the US (6080).
These figures demonstrate the significance of       her book which was well received and widely reviewed in the broadsheet       press including The New York Review of Books, The Times Higher         Educational Supplement, The FT Magazine (Culture), The Sunday Times         (Culture), Tribune, The Historian.
In the London Review of Books       in May 2008, Jeremy Harding described the book as `a convincing piece of       history drawing on contemporary accounts'.
It was translated into Japanese       in 2009 with a print run of 2,000 copies.
Diamond's books have been widely       adopted on University courses relating to French/ European history and       Gender history across the UK and the US (including at Yale, Amherst and       McMater, Canada).
Contribution to the creative sector     1.
In the media     As detailed below, the wide dissemination of Diamond's publications have       led her to be regularly approached by radio and TV producers who engage       her to shape the delivery of her research for their programmes.
She has       been able to change their assumptions and shape their outputs thereby       refining existing narratives about the period.
In particular, she has       showcased women's voices and experience.
Her work has informed the ways       that the public understand and remember the everyday of the Second World       War.
Radio producers     Diamond made an expert contribution to a BBC World Service's `The Why       Factor' in October 2012 on `The Shaved Head'.
She was interviewed about       her research on the women whose heads were shaved in `punishment' for       sleeping with the enemy after the Liberation of France.
`Dr Diamond         played an important role ... She provided invaluable background         and helped contextualise the story and issues raised in a powerful and         moving way.
... Dr Diamond sent us some very useful research material,         including her own very accessible book on this period, which helped to         pull together a major section of the programme.
We were extremely         grateful for Dr Diamond's input and look forward to working together         again in the future.
... the World Service has a weekly audience of 180         million globally'.

for the BBC.
In April 2011 she       prepared material for an episode with JK Rowling and provided context for       her relative's wartime letters.
`Her expertise on the daily life of         French civilians during the Second World War helped Jo Rowling to         understand what her great grandfather experienced while he was trapped         in the suburbs of Paris' (consolidated viewing figures 7 million &#8212;       filmed interview not included).
(2) She researched a further episode on       Patrick Stewart whose father experienced post traumatic stress as a result       of his experiences in France in May 1940.
Diamond's research and the       additional documentation she uncovered enabled them to better communicate       the suffering of civilians caught up in events.
(3.5 million viewers,       Diamond credited in the end titles).
In October 2012 she contributed to a New Zealand based production       company's film on NZ born SOE agent Nancy Wake.
`Her on camera         interview ... informed us as producers, as it will our audiences, to         help comprehend the risks that Nancy as a woman agent ran in Occupied         France.
[It] has played an important role in helping our         audiences to understand the context of the world in which the resistance         operated and thereby gave us further insights into the aspect of Nancy         Wake's own experience that should be communicated to audiences.
Diamond's research ... will really help to inform the public         understanding of hidden aspects to these significant events' (3).
The film has been delivered to New Zealand's TV One.
Distributors expect       to sell the programme into Europe, the UK and Australia.
Diamond also advised Maryland based Gardner Productions about the       civilian experience in Paris1939-43 for their film on woman SOE agent       Noor-un-nisa Inayat Khan.
`Diamond's         contribution has played an important role in informing this documentary         project both for us as producers in helping us to shape the material         that will be communicated to audiences and more directly as a result of         her on-screen interview' (4).
The programme will be screened on PBS       in the US in the autumn and is expected to be sold to Channel 4 and other       European channels.
Working with media professionals has enabled Diamond to       reach global audiences and to bring changes in understandings of this       period across the English speaking world.

In the curatorial sector     Fleeing Hitler was used as the basis for 4 of 22 panels (18%) of       an exhibition in Germany on the German invasion of France entitled "Das       &#252;berschreitet die Grenzen der Vernunft &#8212; Mythos Blitzkrieg" which ran at       the German Tank Museum, Munster, Lower Saxony, from August 10 - November       30 2010.
During this period, roughly 40.000 people physically walked       through the hall in which the exhibition was shown.
The exhibition was       then lent to the "Wehrgeschichtliches Museum Rastatt" in the south of       Germany from April 24 - August 15 2011 where a further 5.000 - 10.000       visitors saw the exhibition.
The curator of the exhibition wrote: "...         it's safe to say that the exhibition was at least in some cases able to         change viewpoints fundamentally, based on a deeper understanding of the         human side of this historical event.
"The French" of 1940 in the mind of         these visitors were no longer only the soldiers &#8212; now these visitors         thought also of the civilians and what they had to endure "(5).

Non-academic editors and publishers     Diamond has written reviews and a column for the THES (2-8       September 2010) in their section entitled `The Canon' on Lucie Aubrac's, `Ils         partiront dans l'ivresse' (1984).
Following an invitation she wrote       a preface to Fernande Davis, 2008, `Girl in the Belgian Resistance: A         Wakeful Eye in the Underground', Beach Lloyd Publishers, 2nd       Edition.
In one telling example, Charlotte Heatherley recounted her       elderly friend's reactions to reading Diamond's book: ` As I read         excerpts aloud to Josette, I witnessed a transformation ...
Finally,         here was validation and corroboration of all she had told her family         through the years.
Hearing these stories gave her a kind of peace.
Sharing her memories, getting them permanently recorded, became         Josette's focus during the last month of her life.
She said that it had         made the dying process easier'.
They were published as a book       entitled `Saga of a French Dish' (2010) (6).
Contributing to wider public understanding of the Second World War           in France     The public have been exposed to Diamond's work through her interactions       with the creative sector as described above and she has also been involved       in further public engagement activities which have given her the       opportunity to engage directly with interested parties.

Via community engagement     Diamond's was invited to participate in the events around the 70th       anniversary of De Gaulle's Appel in 1940, and on 17 June 2010 she spoke at       a day conference on `Charles de Gaulle, London and the Resistance' held at       the Institut Fran&#231;ais on women in the French resistance.
She       broadcast two live radio interviews on the morning news (BBC Bristol and       BBC Wales) about her VIP invitation to attend the commemorative ceremony       held at the Chelsea Barracks involving both the French President Sarkozy       and the British Prime Minister Cameron.

Via the web     Diamond's interview on the death of Resistance hero Raymond Aubrac in       April 2012 published by the CNN website provoked considerable discussion       about the nature and extent of the French Resistance and the contribution       it made to the Second World War.
http://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/11/world/raymond-aubrac-obit       It received 250 posted comments and 613 recommendations on facebook.
Diamond is a strong believer in the power of the internet as a tool for       public engagement.
Her work continues to be the subject of web discussions       on sites like goodreads.com, Coolread4.html, wordpress.com and http://thathideousman       testifying to its reach.
On 3/12/2010 one blogger wrote of `Fleeing         Hitler': `we can read this kind of book as a background when we         try to understand what is happening in our times.
...
The kinds of         thoughts that were in the minds of Parisians in 1940 should to some         extent correspond to the thoughts in the heads of people fleeing from         Srebrenica'.
https://whenthenightcomesfallingfromthesky.wordpress.com/2010/12/03/book-fleeing-hitler-france-1940-why-people-run-away-in-war/     The continuous flow of correspondence from readers of her work in the UK       and the US offering her accounts of their and their family's war-time       experiences inspired Diamond to secure funding to put together an       interactive website to enable people to post their family stories and       share their experiences with one another and other interested users.
(See       www.fleeinghitler.org).
This       provides valuable evidence of the level of public engagement and the       transformative influence her work has had on readers.
The website is       currently populated with 44 stories and blogs from a total of 26       contributors.
Comments made both by contributors and users visiting the       website indicate that Diamond's work provides families with a form of       authentication of their stories and has thereby had a significant impact       in helping them to come to terms with that past.
One user commented `A         wonderful opportunity for people to have a voice with their stories,         which otherwise might have disappeared unheard'.
Contributors have       embraced the opportunity to share their family stories with other       interested parties.
Ivor Samuels wrote `When we told my aunt about Hanna Diamond's website         project, it inspired her to recount her story after previously refusing         to put anything down or give an account which was more than disconnected         anecdotes.
We all felt that the website offered her an appropriate way         to present her memories and could offer those interested in the period         and the events a valuable resource' (7).
A psychotherapist commented       on the website that this sharing was important `to help them to face up         to and work through the intergenerational impact of family members         either surviving or indeed perishing in the Holocaust'.
The website       launch was attended by 150 people and generated local media attention.
Since its launch in January 2013, the website has attracted 32 comments       and over 1400 visitors throughout the world.
It is notable that users       spend close to four minutes on the site, viewing an average of at least       four pages per visit which is a remarkably high figure.
The site is       valuable depository for testimony to be preserved digitally; an example of       how digital technology can be used to create a living historical resource       which is a widely available, growing digital archive.
