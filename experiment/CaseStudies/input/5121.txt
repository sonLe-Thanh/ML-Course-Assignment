     Our research at KCL has contributed social science perspectives on health       systems and high quality qualitative methodologies to a field previously       dominated by clinical obstetrics and demography.
We were among the first       to highlight the importance of analysing the expansion of private sector       provision in maternity care in developing countries and of understanding       the impact of `who pays for care' on how it is accessed and delivered.
KCL       research on the key requisites of a functioning referral system for       maternity care in developing countries has led the field and has been       taken up in many different countries.
Changing policy to support independent midwifery practice for poor           communities in Tanzania       Our detailed analysis of the independent midwifery sector and its       potential for improving coverage of `skilled attendance' at birth in rural       and peri-urban Tanzania stimulated policy debate on the range of provision       in the country.
We disseminated our findings nationally in Tanzania via a       briefing (English and Kiswahili) and a short film, which was distributed       on DVD to all District Medical and Nursing Officers (1A).
We also convened       a technical meeting of the Tanzania Nurses and Midwives Council with the       Ministry of Health and other stakeholders to present the findings and       stimulate debate.
A significant outcome of this meeting was the agreement       on modifications to the Standards and Conditions for Establishing and         Operating Private Nursing and Midwifery Homes in Tanzania aimed at       reducing the cost to midwives of setting up maternity homes (1B).
Furthermore, through bringing together the various key policymakers and       professional bodies in Tanzania in a novel way, it drew the policymakers'       attention to the potential role of independent midwives and thereby acted       as a catalyst which opened the door for the first time to incorporation of       independent midwives in Tanzania's national maternal health programming.
For example, the independent midwives' organisation in Tanzania `PRINMAT'       was subsequently included in the Public Private Partnership for the       National Road Map Strategic Plan to accelerate reduction of maternal,       newborn and child deaths in Tanzania for 2008-15 (1C) and the services of       PRINMAT were included in the provisions of the National Health Insurance       Fund of Tanzania.
Our research also influenced activities of international NGOs such as the       Netherlands Catholic Organisation for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID)       (1E), which acted to reduce the cost of delivery care provided by the       independent midwives via a performance-based financing project for the       owners of maternity homes in Tanzania, extending this contract in 2009       with the aim of increasing the number of deliveries by independent       midwives to 9,000 per annum by 2010/11.
Catalysing and informing international policy focus on referral           systems in maternity care       Our research and review of evidence on maternity referral systems (Ref 5)       informed the UN Millennium Project and provided underpinning to Chapter       Four of Who's got the power?
Transforming health systems for women and         children, the key 2005 report of the UN Millennium Task Force on       Child health and Maternal health (2A).
The findings of our review and the       `Murray &amp; Pearson framework' (Ref 5) have been used in the past few       years to inform design of assessments of referral systems in many settings       including Ghana (2B), Bangladesh (2C), Armenia (2D), and Ethiopia (2E).
Examples of use by global policy institutions include two influential       international meetings held during 2010.
As part of the Maternal         Health Dialogue Series, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for       Scholars' Global Health Initiative, in collaboration with the Maternal       Health Task Force, UN Population Fund, US Agency for International       Development and Columbia University, convened a technical meeting with 25       experts from five countries, including those from KCL, to extend       understanding of emergency referral, especially the coordination of       emergency transportation systems that directly facilitate the swift       physical movement necessary for effective referral (3A).
Also in 2010, the       "Rethinking Referral Systems" consultation was co-convened in New York by       the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation with the Averting Maternal Death       and Disability Programme.
This meeting, at which Dr Murray was a key       speaker, brought together 50 international experts from UN agencies, major       funders and national health policy makers concerned with key components of       emergency referral systems including maternal-newborn health,       transportation, public works, mobile technologies, and emergency medicine       (3B).
Guiding UK and other donor government policy on maternal health in           developing countries       In 2009 DFID and NORAD (the Norwegian Agency for Development Co-operation)       jointly commissioned a comprehensive review of global evidence upon which       to draw when advising their respective governments on the best strategies       to secure the achievement of Millennium Development Goal 5 (maternal       health).
On the basis of her expertise in the field Dr Murray was asked to       co-author, with Options, the review of evidence about what makes a       difference to maternal health, what is good practice, what needs to       improve and where further information is needed to make a judgement (4A).
This review has been used to guide UK government policy on maternity care,       family planning and safe abortion in developing countries.
This is       evidenced by a statement by Baroness Verma in the House of Lords on 11 Feb       2011 that this was one of five key documents guiding work on family       planning, and that it had been distributed to all DFID country offices as       well as being placed in the Library of the House of Lords (4B).
Further       evidence of use by DFID country offices in informing the design of       maternal health interventions is indicated by reference to it made in       documentation, such as that of the Pakistan Maternal and Newborn Health       Research and Advocacy Fund, a five year national programme co-funded by       DFID and AusAID which aims to support research and advocacy initiatives to       influence pro-poor policy and practice reform related to maternal and       newborn health in Pakistan (4C).
Influence on policy debates on aid       priorities further afield is also evident in citation by the Anglican       Church of Australia's Public Affairs Commission 2011 submission to the       Australian Government's Independent Review of Aid Effectiveness (4D).
