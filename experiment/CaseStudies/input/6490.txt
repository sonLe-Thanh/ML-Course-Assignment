     The research expertise which has underpinned impactful activities is as       follows: in-depth specialist knowledge of musical styles, structures and       processes has informed a variety of creative outputs; extensive       familiarity with various repertoires has enhanced knowledge and       understanding in different educational contexts, including the support of       school curricula; expert knowledge and musical insight have been       disseminated through media work and other critical commentaries; and the       understanding of and sensitivity to Iranian music and culture has raised       cultural awareness and acceptance among others both in the UK and       internationally.
There are four major dimensions to the impact:     a) Educational work with schools &#8212; The Shahnameh Project: Between       November 2011 and May 2012 Nooshin initiated and led a collaborative       outreach project with the Education and Community Department at the London       Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO).
The project also involved one of the LPO's       partner organisations, the Bridge Project (an organisation providing free       music tuition to children who might not otherwise have the opportunity to       learn an instrument).
The Shahnameh Project introduced key stage 2       children (ages 7 to 11) to Iranian music and culture through several       workshops and teacher-led activities, including working with composer       David Bruce on a specially-commissioned piece for orchestra; Iranian       instruments and narrator; and Prince Zal and the Simorgh, which       was premiered at two LPO BrightSparks schools' concerts at the Royal       Festival Hall on 23rd May 2012.
The LPO reaches about 15,000       children annually through its BrightSparks concerts.
The majority of them       have not previously experienced a live orchestral performance.
The story       on which the piece was based was selected by Nooshin for its contemporary       social relevance.
The performances involved 53 key stage 1 (ages 5 to 7)       violinists from two south London primary schools (Ashmole and Jessop);       Iranian musicians Arash Moradi and Fariborz Kiani; storyteller Sally Pomme       Clayton; and members of City's Middle Eastern Music Ensemble.
The concerts       were attended by 4,658 key stage 2 children and 75 teachers.
Initial       workshops were held at Ashmole and Jessop Schools in the autumn of 2011,       involving around 120 children, during which Bruce developed initial ideas       for his piece.
He worked closely with Nooshin, learning about Iranian       music styles, structures and processes, particularly in relation to the       role of improvisation.
Bruce is a successful British composer with an       international profile whose previous work with the LPO and recent       children's opera production at the Royal Opera House made him particularly       suitable for the project.
The school sessions included whole school       assemblies at which the Iranian musicians, City music students and       storyteller Sally Pomme Clayton performed, introducing Iranian music and       culture through one of the stories from the epic Shahnameh.
The       majority of children attending the assemblies had not seen or heard the       Iranian instruments before.
Nooshin also wrote a Teachers' Guide,       introducing Iranian modes, rhythms and instruments as well as broader       cultural issues and including practical classroom activities.
The Guide       was available through the LPO website, together with relevant sound       examples.
Additionally, two INSET training sessions, led by Nooshin and       Patrick Bailey (LPO Education and Community Department) and attended by 35       teachers, were held in April 2012 to assist teachers in preparing pupils       for the concerts.
The reach and significance of the impact can be judged from the       attendance figures, qualitative feedback from post-concert teacher       questionnaires and interviews with the Bridge Project and the LPO       Community and Education Department.
Teachers provided qualitative feedback       on how the children benefited from the concert, workshops and classroom       activities, for example: `The children enjoyed hearing the story set to         music and left humming various tunes.
They noticed the Iranian         instruments and benefited from seeing real live musicians.'
and `The         Bruce piece served as a model for pieces the children put together the         following week.
The children's performances were of a high standard, no         doubt as a result of the previous week's visit to the Royal Festival         Hall.'
The Teachers' Guide and INSET sessions received similarly positive       feedback, highlighting ways in which the project facilitated       cross-curricular work with subjects such as mathematics; art; literacy;       geography; personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) and citizenship       education, as well as developing music-specific skills in listening,       performing and composing: `My colleague and I LOVED the Teachers'         Guide; coupled with the INSET training session.
It is possibly the best         resource we've ever been provided with for an educational visit.
I         played audio clips that were recommended in the pack, did the activities         based around the map and Iran's location and talked about oral stories         and the children also painted their own Simorghs.
'; `The concert and         resource pack provided a rich `text' as a basis for our Literacy work.
It exposed children to a new culture.
Their listening skills were         developed by using Prince Zal's theme to understand how a character         changes over the course of a story.
And the concert inspired the         children in their own music-making.
The information about the         instruments and drumming rhythms were useful in music and maths lessons.
';       'We used the drumming patterns from the resources pack in a Mathematics         lesson, working out which numbers could be made by adding strings of 2s         and 3s.
Lots of children subsequently identified the concert as their         favourite trip of the year!
'; `The week before the concert we         used the story in our Literacy lessons.
The children were really engaged         with the story and produced some really good writing.
This meant that         they were familiar with both the story and music, which enhanced their         enjoyment and engagement at the concert.
'; `The background work         to Iranian rhythms was an excellent introduction and proved a good basis         for percussive activities in school.
We composed our own music to the         Prince Zal story using the Iranian modes and rhythms.
Great fun!'
and `The children created their own compositions based on the some of         the rhythms they had heard using ideas that we were shown in the         teachers' session.
The music produced was very good.'
Pupil         responses were equally positive: `From the story I learnt that you         cannot be cross with someone forever.
You need to forgive.
If you have         something you should be grateful for it because you may regret it if         you're not.'
(PSHE and citizenship education); `I liked the daf         best.
It was noisy.
I wish they would come to our school.'
The         Bridge Project also reported that: `This was a very successful project         on many levels.
It was good for the children to work with adults and         other young people outside their sphere; it's an encouraging validation         to have young professionals come into their school and invest time in         them and to have a piece written especially for them.
The real value of         having City University involved was bringing diverse elements to the         collaboration in a way that we haven't seen before and which provided so         many different types of role models for the children.'
They also         commented on the value of the project to the children in performing in a         professional setting on stage at the Royal Festival Hall and being able to       `experience making music in such a large ensemble and to feel that         they're contributing something of worth.
For these children from these         schools and at this age it's the kind of memory that will remain with         them forever.
They will also identify these experiences, and the people         they are making music with, with Iran and as they get older and engage         more in current affairs that will be for them a really positive memory         of things Iranian.'
Composer David Bruce provided further evidence of the impact of the         project in the form of personal testimony: `The project helped spread         ideas and understanding about Iranian culture and music to everyone         involved.
From talking with Laudan and reading the materials she gave me         I gained a more fine-grained understanding of the music of the region.
I         also gained understanding of some of the techniques of Iranian classical         music, the concepts of gusheh and dastgah and the way a scale might, for         example, emphasize a particular pitch other than the root.'
Bruce         has since drawn on these ideas further in his compositional work,         including in the piece `Cut the Rug', commissioned by Yo Yo Ma and the         Silk Road Ensemble and premiered in New York's Carnegie Hall on 16th         October 2013.     b) Print media.
Nooshin has contributed to several high-profile         publications aimed at the general public, including The Rough Guide to         World Music: Africa &amp; Middle East, London: Rough Guides, 2006         (`Iran: The Art of Ornament', pp.519-32); Songlines: The World Music         Magazine (two features and 15 CD reviews since 2008; average         international circulation 20,000 per issue between 2008 and 2013); and The         Middle East in London magazine (circulation 800 per issue).
Nooshin         has also written CD liner notes for prominent Iranian vocalists Mohammad         Reza Shajarian and Shahram Nazeri (Without You: Masters of Persian         Music, World Village USA, 468011, 2002; Faryad: Masters of         Persian Music, World Village USA, 468023, 2006; and Through         Eternity: Persian Devotional Music, Sounds True USA, STAM112D,         1999).
All of these came about through invitation and Nooshin's recognised         expertise in the field.
Those published before 2008 are still on sale and         in wide public circulation, both in the UK and internationally.
c) Broadcast media and performances.
In February 2008 Nooshin        appeared by invitation on the BBC Radio 3 programme World Routes        (average audience 88,000, source: RAJAR) reviewing current Iranian music        CDs.
Her research has also raised the profile of musicians about whom she        has written, particularly outside Iran, thus impacting on CD sales and        audience-generation.
Many musicians have acknowledged this.
Iran's        foremost pop group, Arian Band, posted information on Nooshin's edited        volume, which includes a chapter on their music, on their website        (www.arianmusic.com/en).
Prominent musician Kayhan Kalhor has used text from CD liner notes by        Nooshin on his website (www.kayhankalhor.net/).
d) Other impact activities include: Convening a festival of Music       in Middle Eastern Cinema, including screenings at the Tricycle Theatre,       Kilburn, London (May 2011, funded by LCACE and Iran Heritage Foundation       (IHF)); advising IHF on music for a promotional film by Sogand Bahram       (March 2011); speaking at and chairing sessions for the London Borough of       Kensington and Chelsea's Nur Festival of contemporary Middle Eastern and       North African arts (autumn 2012 and 2013); advising film-maker Andrew       Smith on a film about female singers in Iran (2013); public workshops and       concerts with City's Middle Eastern Ensemble (2008 to 2013) at venues       including the British Museum (part of Magic of Persia's Educational Family       Weekends), BBC Maida Vale studios (BBC Symphony Orchestra Persepolis       Project) and the October Gallery.
Most of these activities came about by       invitation.
Iran Heritage Foundation and Magic of Persia are the primary       organisations promoting wider public understanding of Iranian arts,       culture and history in the UK.
Nooshin's involvement in their activities       has contributed positively to their work in this area.
This research has supported the creation of new forms of artistic       expression linked to Iranian music; influenced attitudes and perceptions       of musicians, scholars, readers and listeners; enriched the cultural lives       and aesthetic experiences of children and adults in a range of performance       and multimedia contexts; enhanced knowledge and understanding in different       educational environments; and contributed significantly to the       preservation, renewal and interpretation of Iranian musical heritage.
The       impact thus relates to several broad areas, including benefits to cultural       life, education, economic prosperity, public discourse and civil society;       disseminated through a number of channels including educational work with       schools; print and broadcast media; consultancy work for a range of       organisations and festivals; and performance work in a variety of       contexts.
Beneficiaries of the activities detailed include: 1) school       children and teachers involved in the Shahnameh Project; 2) BBC Radio 3       listeners; 3) musicians, including those whose work has been promoted       through the underpinning research and activities listed; members of the       LPO; Iranian musicians involved in the Shahnameh Project; and composer       David Bruce; 4) readers of magazines and books directed at lay audiences;       5) publishers, record companies and others benefiting economically from       audio and other media outputs; 6) purchasers of music CDs; 7) audiences       attending public lectures and film screenings; 8) film-makers: Sogand       Bahram, Andrew Smith and those whose work was screened at the 2012 film       festival; and 9) Iranians in the UK, through better public understanding       of their music and culture.
This is a community whose self-esteem is       severely affected by British media representations of Iran.
One response       by a teacher following the Shahnameh Project points to this: `We had an         Iranian pupil, and her family were very excited about the chance to talk         about their heritage.
She was able to bring her own versions of the         stories to read to the class.'
Although this aspect of impact is       often subtle and not easy to evidence, the various manifestations of       Nooshin's research are nevertheless extremely important in determining how       communities view themselves and their places in British society, thereby       aiding integration and more positive community relations in a       multi-cultural society.
