     The development of evidence informed policy and strategy focused on         patients' information needs:             2008, 2011-2012: Directly informing national guidelines in         patient management, research findings by Ormandy et al.
identified the         key information needs preferences and priorities for people with CKD in         the UK.
The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions used         these findings to guide NICE recommendations for healthcare         practitioners on what to consider when meeting the information needs of         people with CKD in practice settings: (NICE 2008: p181-182) http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG73/Guidance/pdf/English        Ormandy led a workshop for the Department of Health Senior Renal         Advisory Group on patient engagement to enhance the skills of health         professionals.
As an expert advisor Ormandy, in partnership with Salford         Royal Foundation NHS Trust, assisted clinicians to secure funding from         National Kidney Care for a local shared decision-making project in         clinical practice.
This project implemented a patient-led approach to         information provision through introducing agenda setting within clinics,         improving patient confidence to make clear their information needs         within consultations to facilitate decision making.
In partnership with the local Kidney Patients Association, to         facilitate improved information provision, Ormandy &amp; Vasilica (PhD         student) secured grant funding in 2013 to develop a user-led online         digital and social media CKD information hub, tailored to meet the needs         of patients by patients, using digital and social media to facilitate         patient to patient information provision, networking and communication         for people with CKD.
This network is established and patients are         generating and adding content, www.gmkin.org.uk           The development of user responsive health information and enhanced use         of digital media by healthcare providers:             2009-2011: The deployment of digital media for sexual health         education is extensive, however many interventions are undertaken in the         absence of methods for impact evaluation.
The Brook sexual health         education through digital media KTP project, developed digital media         based interventions embedded with evaluation mechanisms to continually         assess the impact and the value of interventions in practice.
Client and         clinic activity data naturally occurring within the different Brook         services was harmonised to allow the generation of regular reports,         numbers of young people targeted, activity undertaken, as a clear         evidence base of sustained activity to provide for potential increase in         uptake of initiatives.
The ethos of the service shifted to understanding         what works, why and how they could do things differently, as a result of         the embedded evaluation training deployed across the organisation.
The KTP improved engagement with the free condom service for boys         through digital media (iPod, videos).
The           Condom Demonstration `app' provides a mechanism for educating a         wider population on condom use, whilst gathering automated data through         a reporting system on the use of the app, ethnicity of people that use         it, and capturing behavioural changes.
The condom demo `app', was         nominated for a Brook 2011 National Innovation Award and shortlisted as         a finalist, and publicised by the BBC where it was promoted on the Radio         (by Light and Vasilica).
The `app' is available through the national         organisation website and the iPhone App store.
The outcomes of the KTP         have been taken up nationally with Brook National extending trials of a         Web 2.0 based community site.
Knowledge has been exchanged throughout Brook as the project         progressed leading to a significant cultural change locally enabling         Brook National staff to lead the way in accessible social media sexual         health education, securing a Department of Health Virtual Health project         (&#163;170K), increasing the organisation's ability to secure new service         contracts in an increasingly competitive environment.
Increased patient involvement in their health care:             2010-2011: The "`Are You Ready For Your Screen Test?
',         initiative, which included humorous short films on You Tube based on         blockbuster movies like Star Wars, Love Actually and Dirty Dancing, was         launched by the Lesbian and Gay Foundation in partnership with the         University of Salford and funded by the NHS Cervical Screening         Programme.
The campaign used You Tube films, booklets, posters and         radio, print, online and social media advertising and information with         the Hollywood theme and had a massive impact.
Analysis of the 12 month         North West campaign was undertaken by Ormandy and Light and findings         from the 1,000 women surveyed included;       o Only 49% of respondents of an eligible age (25-64) had been for a         cervical screening test within NHS recommended time scales, rising to         73% post-campaign;       o 51% reported some form of positive behaviour change as a result of         the campaign;       o 96% felt that the campaign was effective.
The Lesbian &amp; Gay Foundation's campaign encouraging women not to         ignore a test which could mean the difference between life and death         earned the Manchester-based group top billing in the Jo's Cervical         Cancer Trust 2011 Cervical Screening Awards.
2012-2013: Promoting Cervical Screening in the North West:           A Digital Media Based Approach engaged women in the 24-29 age         group and has embedded evaluation mechanisms throughout to constantly         audit its performance, and adjust its methodology to maximise its         impact.
The campaign         is improving this age group's awareness, knowledge and confidence in         cervical screening.
Starting from a zero base in March 2013, in terms of         community/network, to date the campaign website has received over 3000         unique views, Facebook has 2200 likes with an associated audience of         over 120,000 and our YouTube videos have had almost 9500 views.
Over 450         women have completed our evaluative survey and our initial analysis is         that 82% report that they think the campaign is effective, 50% report         that it has had a positive effect on their knowledge, confidence or         behaviour, 45% reported no change as they already went for screening.
