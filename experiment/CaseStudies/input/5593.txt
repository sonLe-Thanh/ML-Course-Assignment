     A.
The Outreach Team: The RCT of this community-based       rehabilitation programme, showing positive effects, continues to influence       policy and service provision internationally.
It remains a key point of       reference in relation to publicly and privately funded       healthcare/rehabilitation &#8212; for example:             USA: The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is         mandated by Congress to carry out Clinical Effectiveness Reviews [CERs]         which "inform health plans, providers, purchasers, government           programs, and the health care system as a whole".
This RCT is one         of a handful of studies judged sufficiently strong to feature in an         on-going CER of postacute TBI rehabilitation.
[1]         Health insurers now fund cognitive rehabilitation after TBI, but not         after other conditions, on the basis of the evidence base of which this         RCT is a key part; the study is explicitly cited in the official 2013         Medical Policy documents of United Healthcare and Anthem Healthcare.
[2]         The latter for instance states that "...published data provides the           most support for effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation in           individuals with TBI.
For example, Powell and colleagues (2002)..."         Canada: A 2011 government-mandated evidence-based review         informing national healthcare policy cites Powell's study as the only         Level 1 evidence that "structured multidisciplinary rehabilitation           in community settings can improve social functioning.
"[3]         New Zealand: The Accident Compensation Corporation, which         provides universal comprehensive personal injury cover, cites the RCT in         its 2011 Pragmatic Based Review which concludes that "a           multidisciplinary rehabilitation program appears to be the most           effective approach to help people with TBI reintegrate into the           community."
[4]           B.
The BICRO scale: Over 40 hospitals, treatment centres and       clinicians from across the world including the UK, USA, Canada, Australia,       New Zealand, Japan, Israel, France and Germany have requested use of the       BICRO.
It is free to download,       subject to registration, and is being used extensively to evaluate       outcomes at individual and service level.
[5]     One of the UK's leading private providers of medico legal reports and       rehabilitation funded through compensation awards, Rehab Without Walls       [RWW], uses the instrument routinely to assess and report on progress: "BICROs         are done on formally taking on a new case, and at formal reviews (e.g.
6         monthly) thereafter ...This is a vital part of our quality assurance,         and demonstrates our commitment to measure our effectiveness ...When I'm         reviewing progress, BICRO scores give a very good anchor point against         which to judge both current clinical status and proposals for further         input."
(Director of RWW [6]).
RWW has approached       Powell seeking the development of a paediatric version; preliminary work       on this, collaboratively between RWW and Goldsmiths, has commenced.
C. The QOLIBRI: In the public domain for less than two years, the       QOLIBRI is in heavy demand and available for free         download.
Since its original validation in English, French, German,       Dutch, Italian and Finnish it has been translated into numerous additional       languages including Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Indonesian, Japanese,       Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Russian.
It has been       separately validated in Australia [Hawthorne et al., 2011]; other       validations are on-going.
On the 31/07/13 there were over 400 registered users in 35 countries       across all continents.
Of these, 34% were university-based, 60%       clinically-based, c. 2% in voluntary support organisations such as       Headway, and c. 3.5% in military rehabilitation facilities.
It has also       been downloaded by individual clinicians and TBI survivors.
Registration       information provided in order to access the instrument and reported in the       database[7] evidences well over 200 rehabilitation       centres, health authorities, and healthcare providers using it to inform       treatment and/or evaluate outcomes.
Examples of its diverse clinical and       policy applications include:             Belgium, DenAchtKanter: "Every client has a personal           support plan and we would like to have an idea in what measure their           TBI influences their QoL.
Once we have a better view, we hopefully           will be able to make better objectives."
England, Chase Park Rehabilitation Centre: "To produce an           outcomes document for commissioners of services, people with BI and           their families."
New Zealand, Abano Rehabilitation: "To determine whether           our clients are satisfied with their lives in our facilities and, if           not, what we can do about it."
Norway, Suunass Rehabilitation Hospital: "To use pre, post           and at follow-up to study whether improved executive functioning is           related to improved mental health and QoL."
Pakistan, Aga Khan University Hospital: "To measure health           care and personal costs of head injuries in motorcycle riders ... so           that we can make a case for helmet regulation."
Scotland, NHS Greater Glasgow: "To compare QoL of young           [TBI] adults living in nursing homes with [those] living in community           and [with the] general population."
USA, Krempels Centre: "To determine if we are meeting our           mission of improving the lives of people living with BI [brain           injury]."
It is now recommended for national use by the Finnish public health and       social care network (TOIMIA) [8] and by a US       Government/National Institutes of Health interagency group,[9]       and has been incorporated into numerous prospective or comparative       clinical investigations.
In the US the NIH Clinical Trials website [10]       shows it being utilised in three treatment evaluations; and the qolibrinet       database indicates its use in over 80prospective studies or randomised       controlled treatment trials [RCTs] with projected samples of &gt;200.
Examples of studies going on across the world using it as a key outcome       measure include:             Australia: The Royal Perth Hospital is studying the prevalence         and severity of symptoms and QoL after road traffic related TBI (n=450).
Finland: An EU-funded project at Turku University Hospital is         developing individual evidence-based diagnostics and treatment solutions         to match treatments to clinical features [n=1000].
Spain: Barcelona's Valld'Hebron University Hospital is         evaluating a core dataset, including the QOLIBRI, for assessing outcome         after moderate and severe TBI [n = 200+].
UK: Two on-going projects in Cambridge include a prospective         study of outcomes after mild TBI (n=1000); and an RCT of surgical         interventions for acute subdural haematoma.
USA: Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Centers [North         Carolina, Washington State, Pennsylvania]: (a) a prospective evaluation         of outcomes in 750 active duty members after concussion; (b)         investigation of the chronic consequences of mild TBI in recent         returnees of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars (n = 515); (c) development by         the Office of Rehabilitation Services of a VA TBI-Toolbox with         instruments for use by its polytrauma rehabilitation providers.
USA: Tulane Institute of Sports Medicine: Effects of treatment         for head trauma in &gt;200 professional football players.
In 2011 the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical company awarded the QOLIBRI its       annual Quality of Life prize, which recognises outstanding research       achievements contributing to improving patients' QoL [11].
The QOLIBRI Society has been established to promote dissemination and       research into factors affecting QoL after TBI; Powell is on the Board, and       on 11/06/13 she organised and hosted (at Goldsmiths) a symposium/workshop       directed principally at clinicians, and delivered by international       speakers from the QOLIBRI taskforce.
It was sponsored by the prominent law       firm, Leigh Day, which believes that the QOLIBRI will be valuable in the       medicolegal context, helping to quantify the effects of TBI and thus to       inform the courts in relation to compensation payments [12].
The event, for which there was a registration fee, was attended by over 60       clinicians and service providers; the revenue is being used by the Society       to facilitate future dissemination and training events.
Many of the       attendees have subsequently become members of the Society, and have       registered their interest in contributing data from their services to a       collaborative database to be used for normative and comparison purposes.
The workshop will be replicated in Germany next year.
