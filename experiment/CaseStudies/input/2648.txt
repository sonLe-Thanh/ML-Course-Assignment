     Context: Rating individuals in team sports is a complex task.
Metrics for comparing players with the same specialism abound, but       comparing players with different roles is difficult.
It has been attempted       in baseball, but football is more difficult because players have different       roles that can themselves vary between games and within games.
Despite       these difficulties, the potential usefulness of a single rating system was       clear: teams can identify undervalued players; player selection debate can       be enhanced; such an index can be sold commercially.
FIFA World rankings       form part of the criteria for awarding work permits for players outside       the European Union in the English Premier; and rankings can influence       tournament outcomes.
The development of the Index, the EA Sports Player       Performance Index (PPI), the official player ratings system of the English       Premiership, Championship and the Scottish Premiership, the first of its       kind to rate individual players in team sport on a common scale, followed       the convergence of three factors:            The availability of detailed data on player contributions;       Underpinning research at University of Salford; and 	   The commercial imperative of the FA Premier League (PL).
The Index only includes actions that can be measured objectively, with         the intention of removing opinion bias and only working with proven         statistical metrics that become more precise as the season progresses.
The Index forms part of a wider package of sports news information that         is sold commercially around the world by PA acting as an agent for         Football DataCo (FDC).
The Index is used in football gaming software and the English           Premiership's official application for the Fantasy           Football League, engaging fans across the world with           quantitative analysis and generating statistics driven debate by           connecting with their passion:              On completion of its development, the index became part of ACTIM         statistics and was sold worldwide by PA to media organisations, and         marketed by PL, notably through Fantasy Football.
Free to play and with         over 2.5 million players, Fantasy Premier League is the biggest fantasy         football game in the world, demonstrating the use of high quality,         theoretical research in a living application of relevance to people who         do not normally get the opportunity to engage with objective performance         measurement and statistics; 	       The Index has brought economic benefit to English Football through           its syndication and commercial benefit internationally: 		         EA SPORTS became Official Sports Technology Partner of the Premier         League in 2010 when the Index was renamed.
PL           Director of Sales &amp; Marketing,  said: "We are extremely           pleased that EA SPORTS has had the foresight to enter into this           exciting new partnership that will connect with Barclays Premier           League fans in new and inventive ways.
Fans have a thirst for           statistics and information and that is something that the Premier           League, working with EA SPORTS, will provide to a level not seen           before in professional football."
EA SPORTS uses the Player Performance Index to extend the authenticity         and depth of its football franchises, sponsoring the PPI to improve its         brand image and to associate objectivity and rigour with the rating         system used in its games, including the EA SPORTS FIFA series of         computer games, one of the highest selling games internationally.
An         index based on the PPI methodology is used in this game for the dynamic         modification of player form.
Beginning with FIFA11's new Rating, Skill         and Morale System, FIFA           MANAGER used the new system to "rate its 40,000 players and to           make the differences between the players more obvious".
The functionality of the Manager Hub was extended in subsequent FIFA         series including FIFA13's Manager           Hub to: "Analyse the match by looking at match or player           specific stats to help make managerial decisions.
Tap on any player to           get full statistical analysis...See a player's performance stats and           even their energy to help you make...substitutions."
Since its         release in October 2012, FIFA13 was named as the most successful game of         2012.
Winning Sports Game of the Year &#8212; D.I.C.E Awards 2012, FIFA13 sold         over 4.5 million copies worldwide within five days of release.
It         counted 800,000 simultaneous players online, an all- time record.
More         than 1.2 million copies were sold in the UK within 48 hours, and 66         million online games have already been played &#8212; representing 600 million         minutes of online play.
14.5 million copies had been sold by May         2013.The Executive VP of EA Sports said 		"Every minute of every day           millions of fans around the world are experiencing what the critics           have already said FIFA 13 is the biggest and best sports game we have           ever created."
The EA Sports Player Performance Index (PPI) was the first of its         kind, others have followed (e.g.
the FIFA Castrol Index), motivated by         the commercial benefits of engaging with fans', managers' and sports         analysts' appetite for statistical analysis.
The index is discussed on television e.g.
Barclays Premier League           Review (Sky Sports 1, Friday 25.10.2013) reviewed the best         goalkeepers, presenting the top 5 and their index points.
McHale and Scarf have promoted the science behind the index to         non-academic audiences, in national newspapers (The Telegraph, The         Scotsman), local newspapers and online, internationally (Bloomberg         Press) discussing McHale's predictions for the winner of the 2010 World         Cup.
McHale appeared on national television in October 2010 (BBC 1         Football Focus); in May 2012 he discussed rating footballers using         statistics (BBC Radio London and Radio Manchester; in June 2012 he         discussed forecasts for European Championships on BBC R5.
