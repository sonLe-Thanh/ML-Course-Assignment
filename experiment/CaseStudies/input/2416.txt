     Impacts on production: decisions by regulatory authorities have been         influenced by research       In December 2008, the GB Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) approved the       BioBullets product Silver Bullets 1000 for use in public water supplies       [text removed for publication].
A second formulation suitable for very       large water volumes and carrying a different active ingredient (currently       confidential), Silver Bullets 2000, was approved in April 2011 [text       removed for publication].
These approvals demonstrated the environmental       safety of the products, and enabled them to be tested within operational       drinking water plants.
The Environment Agency has also provided permits       for discharge of Biobullets' products into recipient streams and rivers,       with monitoring of riverine biota before and after dosing trials       repeatedly showing the broken-down product to have no measurable impact on       aquatic biota8, and regards "The biobullet formulation [as]         an essential management tool in our response to a variety of priority         invasive non-native species.
"8     Impacts on production: costs of [drinking water] production have been         reduced       Since the 2008 DWI approval, eight full-scale trials have been conducted       within the impact period in seven UK waterworks, belonging to Anglian       Water9, South Staffordshire Water10, Thames Water11,       Severn Trent Water and Welsh Water.
Dosing of Silver Bullets 1000 [text       removed for publication] has yielded highly successful results [text       removed for publication].
Removal of mussels from raw water pipes has       resulted in reduced pipe restrictions, with related savings on pumping       costs.
For example, a representative of Anglian Water said: "There had         been a significant loss of performance at our water treatment works in         Covenham due to large numbers of zebra mussels blocking the pipes         feeding the plant.
Use of BioBullets significantly reduced the number of         mussels, demonstrating a cost effective solution to the problem".9     The potential financial impact of BioBullets' products on the UK water       industry is very significant and has already been recognised.
For example,       Thames Water spent &#163;1m in 2010 alone clearing zebra mussels from their raw       water pipes11.
Anglian Water reported in 2011 that the       increased pressure required to pump water through zebra mussel-infested       pipes is costing them &#163;500K per annum in additional energy costs11.
Following trials of BioBullets, the companies stated:            "We believe BioBullets will save hundreds of thousands of pounds in           operational costs in a way that has no adverse impact on the           environment.
"11         We are very hopeful BioBullets are the solution we've been looking           for having trialed them at our treatment works at Alton in Suffolk and           Pitsford in Northamptonshire.
In both cases we saw a significant           reduction in the numbers of mussels without any impact on the           treatment process or the environment.
"11           Currently, BioBullets is currently negotiating commercial terms with a       service provider [text removed for publication] to deliver the product       across the UK water industry.
Impacts on commerce: the performance of an existing business has been         improved; industry has invested in research and development       In June 2011, a dedicated manufacturing plant for BioBullets was opened in       Bristol [text removed for publication].
The plant was part funded through       a &#163;500K grant from the Technology Strategy Board [text removed for       publication].
The plant has an annual capacity of 5000 tonnes [text       removed for publication].
International impacts on commerce       Tests and trials have been carried out in other countries: tests in the       Netherlands (by [text removed for publication] a major consultant to the       European and Asian power industries) yielded 100% mortality[text removed for publication].
Trials funded by the Aragon government in Spain in       February 2011 resulted in a highly effective removal of fouling zebra       mussels and Asian clams (Corbicula spp.)
within irrigation systems:       "Infestation of irrigation systems by zebra mussels and Asian clams has         presented farmers with problems in maintaining adequate water supplies         to crops.
BioBullets was able to remove substantial volumes of mussels         from the irrigation pipes.
"13 BioBullets is currently in       discussion with both the US and Spanish water industries about using their       products to control zebra mussels in water supplies in those countries.
Given the breadth of the initial patent, the company has diversified its       product range to target a broad range of invasive aquatic species.
In       2006, BioBullets started development and testing of a formulation to       control fouling by invasive bivalves (Mytilopsis and Perna       spp.)
in [text removed for publication] shrimp farms.
In laboratory tests       in [text removed for publication] in 2010, one formulation yielded 100%       mortality in mussels, but with no harmful effect on the shrimps.
Discussions are underway between BioBullets and [text removed for       publication] two [text removed for publication] shrimp farming companies       [text removed for publication] for full-scale field trials.
In 2008 a       grant to BioBullets from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric       Administration (NOAA)14 enabled the development and testing of       a formulation to control invasive seasquirts (Didemnum vexillum),       pests which threaten the global marine aquaculture industry.
Trials of       formulations in New Zealand in 2010 produced high mortalities in both Didemnum,       and a second invasive and economically damaging seasquirt, Ciona clava15.
The underpinning BioBullets technology has become a platform for       expansion of the company into other areas.
A Feasibility Grant from the       TSB in 2011 enabled development [text removed for publication] to enhance       the growth rates and survival of commercial shellfish larvae.16       [text removed for publication].
In January 2013, BioBullets led a       consortium of three SMEs (the others being Micropore Technologies, UK, and       Scalpro, Norway) in successfully bidding for Eureka Eurostars funding (an       EU R&amp;D programme) to develop microencapsulated feed products to       enhance commercial shellfish yields.17 The speed of juvenile       shellfish growth is currently constrained by the availability of, and       nutrient level in, algal cells; BioBullets' platform technology is       enabling them to encapsulate tailored and optimised nutrient packages for       different shellfish species.
Impacts on the environment: the management of an environmental hazard         has changed       The adoption of Biobullets by UK water companies has changed how the       industry approaches control of zebra mussels.
The products are reducing       the use of chlorine in water supplies on a global scale, and so reducing a       major human and animal aquatic toxin: "Biobullet provides a unique         formulation that has the potential to allow us to target a variety of         invasive non-native species in a manner that will protect the rest of         the ecology from non-target damage.
"8     Since 2004 research and grant writing has been led by David Aldridge, in       his role as Managing Director of BioBullets Ltd. Grant funding has enabled       part-time employment of Aldridge and one other person as consultants to       the company.
[text removed for publication] BioBullets Limited is expected       to become commercial in 2014.
