     The underpinning research detailed in Section 2 identified and addressed       key issues and barriers associated with the implementation of Lean       manufacturing for different sizes of business.
The ERIP project enabled       participating companies to directly benefit through: 1) improved company       practice; 2) improved company performance; and 3) improved regional       infrastructure.
Company practice     The competences within each North Sea country have been strengthened by       executing transnational showcase events with SMEs as a more effective way       for small companies to share and transfer knowledge.
A total of 236 people       undertook transnational training.
A key difference in the design of the       Newcastle bite-size Lean approach was in the diagnostic and workshop       activities, which minimised the time a team and change agent would need to       commit to an improvement event.
The framework additionally enabled SMEs to       more easily collect quantitative and qualitative organisational data and       to understand the need to do so in order to effectively measure the       benefits of their operations.
Key Performance Innovations Ltd. is a micro SME that was formed to       provide commercial solutions for productivity improvements within       businesses where previously there had been public aid and delivered the       training aspect of the ERIP project.
As the Director, Key Performance       Innovations Ltd. commented: "Whilst the ERIP methodology drew on         aspects of the traditional MasterClass, the ... project was structured         around using local examples and empowering the workforce to identify         what activities the project would focus on, which provided a different         emphasis...The companies that I worked with who signed up to the project         received various benefits.
One company displayed characteristics of a         larger manufacturer and wanted primarily to engage with the training of         change agents, two were looking to move into manufacturing and learnt         valuable lessons about how a Lean operation would need to be configured.
The final two companies were the most responsive to the programme.
The         main challenge these companies faced related to freeing up staff to         participate in the improvement events.
With a little tweaking to the         format of the improvement events, taking a more bite sized approach         seemed to work better...I think the most value came from the knowledge         exchange and the building of a network of SMEs trying to engage with         Lean" (IMP1).
This was reinforced by the Production Manager,       Peacocks Medical Group Ltd.: "The development of a bite-size Lean         approach was more appropriate for our organisation as it allowed us to         meet our operational commitments as well as engaging with the ERIP         project" (IMP2).
Established in 1903, Peacocks Medical Group       has been supplying medical equipment and services for over 100 years.
They       have over 170 direct employees and over 60 indirect employees.
Company performance     The project developed a transnational best practice Lean change       methodology that is publically available via the ERIP website.
As the       Production Manager, Peacocks Medical Group commented: "Knowing that         the ERIP web site and access to the ERIP materials is being made         available for the foreseeable future is also a benefit" (IMP2).
A final conference for the ERIP project was held in Newcastle, which       enabled the project partners to present their achievements and challenges.
The conference was also attended by representatives from regional       government, SMEs from Europe and the UK, public sector practitioners and       participants from each of the 6 regional Innovative Productivity Centres.
In total 52 people attended the conference, demonstrating their       willingness to commit time to sharing practice with one another.
The       conference brought together for discussion and evaluation the experiences       of the both the partners and the SMEs in implementing Lean manufacturing.
The Production Manager, Peacocks Medical Group commented: "We were         able to bench mark where we were in comparison to other companies         involved in the project.
We were also able to...potentially build a         network for any potential future collaboration with other SMEs" (IMP2).
Highlights of the impacts described at the conference and by participants       include the following:            L-Druck is a printing company and the introduction of methods learned         through the ERIP project reduced the lead time of a quotation process         from 16 hours to 1 hour.
The cost savings per year amount to more than         140,000&#8364; (IMP3).
The company employees 70 people and is based in         Germany.
Based in Sweden and with 37 direct and 14 indirect employees, Falk         Graphic Media is a printing and graphic producer that had long setup         times due to incomplete customer orders, unclear quality levels and         down-time.
Through ERIP, they reduced setup times, scrap levels and         down-time (IMP4).
Based in Norway and employing 50 people, Noca produces printed circuit         boards and electronic products, and they improved their visual         management due to the 5S activity of the ERIP project, including the use         of toolboards (IMP5).
In Belgium, one participating SME demonstrated a 32% increase in value         added per person (10&#8364;/hour) and a 20% increase in stock turns.
Another         had a 52% increase in productivity and a third participating SME had a         10% increase in internal quality in their powder coating department (IMP6).
In the UK, Peacocks Medical Group estimated that they have reduced         waste through improving materials requisition by 25% and improved their         floor space utilization by 15% (IMP2).
Regional infrastructure     As a legacy of the ERIP project, an infrastructure has been established       in the form of Innovative Productivity Centres (IPCs) (IMP7).
Each       IPC comprises a university, an exemplar company and a regional development       agency.
They were created to facilitate the development and spread of Lean       knowledge and the ERIP methodology.
The transfer of knowledge is achieved       through a combination of change agent training, staff exchanges and       exemplar visits.
SMEs are thus made aware of their competitive       competencies, allowing them to identify their own areas for improvement.
Communication between regional and national governments about Lean allows       the methodology to spread and potentially make the North Sea Region more       competitive.
The IPCs in Holland and Belgium have already become spin-out       companies (IMP8).
In the case of the northern Netherlands, this initiative has been driven       by NPAL, the region's foreign direct investment agency.
Its Manager       recognised the impact of ERIP: "as an outcome of the ERIP project we         have taken the learning forward and as a result established a Northern         Productivity Alliance (similar to NEPA founded in the North East of         England) called NPAL... We initially started with the four SMEs involved         in the ERIP project but this has grown and we currently work with 34         companies in three Lean6Sigma clusters...NPAL organizes also improvement         clusters in the field of safety, health and environment, Sustainability         and HRM issues.
In total over 100 companies are participating in         different activities, represented by over 200 persons.
In all the         clusters we use insights we generated by the ERIP project."
(IMP9).
The Director of Key Performance Innovations Ltd. also commented, "I         felt the collaboration and knowledge transfer element was important and         helped support such small organisations implement aspects of Lean.
By         setting up the regional hubs...the SMEs could be exposed to a regional         exemplar... To complement this learning, the SMEs could draw on each         other for help and advice as well."
