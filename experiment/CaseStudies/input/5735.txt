     Since 2009, Johnson has been working with the Ministry of Defence (MoD),       the Defence Scientific       Advisory Council (DSAC), and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory       (DSTL),       transferring the findings of his research to inform defence and security       policy, strategy and       practice.
He has:     a. developed and delivered a software tool that repurposes his research       on collaborative       creativity [1,2,3] to provide support to stabilization efforts     b. influenced the strategic direction and allocation of resources within       the Human Capability       Research Programme to reflect his work on collaboration between people and       systems       [4,5]     c. demonstrated the value to DSTL of direct engagement with academics and       other external       establishments, resulting in the development of the DSTL Visiting       Scientist scheme and       other commitments of resources.
a) Cyber Influence &amp; Stabilisation: the LifeStories environment         and tool     The Government's National Security Strategy (NSS) highlights the risk to       UK security due to       instability: "Fragile, failing and failed states around the world provide       the environment for terrorists       to operate as they look to exploit ungoverned or ill-governed space".
As       part of the responses to       the threat from unstable countries, the NSS states that the UK will "help       resolve conflicts and       contribute to stability".
To this end the NSS identifies eight National       Security tasks, of which one is       "Tackle at root the causes of instability".
This concern is emphasized in       the Strategic Defence and       Security Review, which details the threats associated with instability,       and notes that the cost of       military intervention is far greater than that of tackling instability       before it flares up into violence.
The Ministry of Defence became interested in Johnson's work in 2009 when       he was invited to       attend a two-day invitation only workshop in Whitehall ("Counter Terrorism       Attack The System") on       novel approaches to counter terrorism.
He outlined how his research in       understanding and       supporting collaboration could be relevant to understanding tribal       structures and relationships in       unstable countries.
He was subsequently asked to provide a more detailed       report and presentation       to MoD in February 2010.
In this report he developed the ideas from [1,2]       to suggest how they       could be used to build and share life-stories of people and groups in       other cultures.
The ongoing operation in Afghanistan and the International Stabilisation       Response Team in Libya       identified challenges with the current way in which UK stabilisation       practitioners operate.
Given the       large amount of data gathered and the speed with which practitioners       operate it is critical to gather,       assess and exploit information rapidly.
In addition, being able quickly to       review previously gathered       information linked to an individual, location or situation both increases       the impact of the personnel       and enables them to understand incidents or actions more rapidly and       accurately.
As       demonstrated in Afghanistan and Libya, stabilisation is a multi-agency       activity, employing both       military and civilian personnel, so the ability to work across       organisation boundaries and share       information rapidly is essential.
Currently this is done using paper       notebooks.
This quickly       becomes unwieldy and it is difficult to search for pertinent information       or to make new links in a       timely manner.
Johnson's report to the MoD in February 2010 detailed how re-purposing       his work on the Digital       Scrapbook developed in [1,2] could assist with this facet of stabilisation       operations.
In February       2011 DSTL awarded funding to develop a prototype of the proposed tool.
This work produced a       prototype digital scrapbook, a user manual and training guide, delivered       in May 2011.
In June 2011       Johnson ran a short training course for DSTL on how to use the scrapbook       to develop life stories of       people, villages, and their activities and contexts.
The MoD have since used the ideas taken from the life-story modelling tool       in the Cyber Influence       and Stabilisation part of the DSTL Cyber and Influence Science and       Technology Centre       (https://www.dstl.gov.uk/cyberandinfluence) to develop awareness and       understanding of people,       villages and activities in different cultures, for use as a "get you in"       pack for military personnel on       stabilization operations.
The scrapbook ideas showed how to improve       information collection and       availability to the military, increasing the links between different       pieces of information and providing       a more accessible, readily intelligible, portable and effective source of       information.
This enhances       the stabilization efforts.
Further work by DSTL resulted in a range of       tools being evaluated during       "Exercise Civil Bridge" carried out for one month in 2012 in Uganda       involving military and civil       personnel.
Johnson's life-story concepts were used as the benchmark on       this exercise.
A principal scientist from the DSTL Cyber and Influence centre confirms       that "this tool was also         shared with military stabilisation practitioners and utilised for         contingency training.
The concept of         displaying and linking information in easy to view schemas is becoming         more widely utilised across         the military and Prof Johnson's research has provided some of the         underpinning foundations for         this."
[S1]     b) Advisory work influencing Human Capability Science &amp;           Technology investment     Johnson's work has had a direct influence on the direction and allocation       of resources within       DSTL's Human Capability Research Programme       (http://www.defencehumancapability.com/).
This       programme represents a significant contribution to defence research in       human capability, with a       budget of &#163;11.6M in 2012/13, coordinated by BAe Systems.
The programme       currently represents       225 research contracts awarded to 190 research suppliers across SMEs,       large businesses and       academia.
Johnson's advisory work has taken place as part of his 20%       secondment to DSTL [S2].
Johnson was the academic member of the Technical Assessment Panel "helping         to review and         select a bidder for the provision of MoD's future Human Sciences         research" [S3].
He went on to       "shape and influence the governance of the programme through his         engagement in the         Programme Governance Board, working with MoD and the supply chain to         evaluate the successes         and issues with the programme" [S3].
Johnson's research has played a key role in the specification, award and       assessment of the       contracts within the programme.
He has established the need to focus on       Humans in Systems from       a broader behavioural and social perspective.
For example, he has drawn on       the findings of [4] to       influence the programme in favour of work that treats humans not as       operators but as collaborators       with autonomous systems (AS).
His autonomous systems work [5] has been       used to advise DSTL       in the focus of their programme away from one-person:one-AS ways of       working, towards one-person:many-AS       and mixed teams of people:AS.
The framework, model and recommendations in       [5] provided a reference point to focus DSTL on issues of command,       reporting and information       sharing between these mixed and one:many teams to achieve greater       awareness and reduce       human cognitive load.
[S4] states that Johnson's work and influence have "ensured         that the         confluence of cyber and traditional infrastructure engineering was         considered in a social and         sociotechnical context.
This raised the value of the work significantly         as critical infrastructures exist         to provide a service to humans and it is not clear that this would have         been captured by the other         participants."
[S3] states that "Peter has provided valuable input to a the Human         Capability Steering Group,         helping our military stakeholders understand where research may play a         role in solving their         problems, but also by signposting where there is already work available         to support an appropriate         intervention &#8212; or where research would not be appropriate.
He has helped         to push the thinking of         this community away from their `here and now' perspective to a longer         term view which will         facilitate longer term research programmes with more stable         requirements.
He plays a key role in         the assessment and down-selection of technical programmes of work within         the new external         delivery mechanisms, and provides a valuable insight into work ongoing         within academic         Departments MoD would otherwise not be sighted on."
[S1] confirms that "Prof Johnson has been instrumental in supporting         the Influence and         Stabilisation programme at DSTL.
This includes providing independent         expert scientific advice to         help challenge suppliers of research to DSTL &#8212; including the likes of         QinetiQ.
This ensures that the         technical standard of work supplied to the military is rigorous and         robust.
[...] This means that         maximum value is achieved from both research council funding (which is         exploited) and for the         military, who can take output from researchers and apply it to real         world problems in defence and         security.
Input from Prof Johnson has already been applied to ongoing         military stabilisation         activities overseas &#8212; directly supporting HMG objectives."
c) DSTL Distinguished Visiting Scientist     In his DSTL Distinguished Visiting Scientist role Johnson has influenced       DSTL policy towards a       Centre of Excellence in the Social and Behavioural Sciences by helping       establish the need and       defining its relationship to external organisations including academia.
Johnson has also influenced       DSTL's broader engagement with academia, advising DSTL on their activities       with research       councils and their national PhD scheme launched in 2011, and developing       with DSTL staff the       DSTL Visiting Scientist scheme.
[S4] thanks Johnson for his work to "create         a more formalised,         rational, visiting scientist scheme."
