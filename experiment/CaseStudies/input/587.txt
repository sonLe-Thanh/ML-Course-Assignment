     Economic Impacts            STORM is the commercial name for the reduction device described         earlier; IOS is the external fixator [1],                Both have CE mark and FDA clearance to market and,         are being commercialised within the spin out company Intelligent           Orthopaedics Ltd (&#163;1.4 million investment).
generated &#163;123k in sales in 2012 [1].
4 patents have been filed; a new patent granted will minimise the         effort of drilling `blind' holes.
[1,2]       It supports (indirectly) employment in 5 companies in Derby, Leeds,         Littlehampton, Portsmouth and Sheffield [1,3].
The experience has created a unique centre for medical devices design;         we have supported other industries and institutions [1,4].
Indirectly this project has supported the exploitation of medical         devices from the 13 West Midlands region's universities through Medical         Interchange; exhibiting their devices at MEDTEC 2008, 2009 and 2010 and         at MEDICA 2010 [4].
The company employs postgraduate students from Staffordshire for work         experience and provides internships as a part of their 2nd         year studies in Engineering [1].
30 publications including one research led book.
The research has been cited in over 300 other publications.
Impacts on Public Policy and Services            STORM is used in Teaching Hospitals and there is evidence that         registrars are being influenced by this new reduction technique         [1,5,6,7].
STORM has been, and is being used in key hospitals across the world: 7         centres in the USA; 12 in Germany; 22 in the UK (including teaching         hospitals at Cambridge, Manchester, Liverpool and Southampton); and 12         in the rest of the World (Eire, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Greece, Italy and         Bulgaria) [1].
Impacts on Society, Culture and Creativity            Exemplified by peers for innovation and engineering [1,8].
Papers have been presented at key conferences and meetings and the         research group are invited to present their methods at surgical         continuing professional development events [1,4].
The main researchers have presented over 14 invited papers or         keynotes.
[1]          Health Impacts            To date 2000-3000 patients have been treated with STORM and         about 250 with IOS [1].
Shorter operating times reduces exposure to General Anaesthesia:         improving operative mortality [1,5,6,7,9].
Use of STORM has been shown to produce near perfect reduction         [1,5,6,7,9];                for the patient this means their leg is as close to normal as           possible [1,5,6,7,9];         and producing a causal link (that we are investigating) to improved           healing and a reduction in non-unions[1,5,6,7].
As improved reduction can be shown to improve prognosis; inherently         reducing the total cost of the procedure [1,6,7].
The most common reason for litigation (USA) for post-operative issues         related to tibial fractures is rotation of the foot.
The near anatomical         reduction produced by STORM eliminates this issue and, hence, reduces         potential litigation costs [1,6,7].
Use of IOS has shown to reduce healing times; the shortest         being circa 9 weeks.
This is 7-8 weeks below the accepted average [1,7];       Allows patients to be mobile the day after their operation [1,7];       Allows patients to wear normal clothing, hence promoting return to         normal activities.
[1,7];       Patients prefer IOS to other methods they have been treated with, even         plaster [1,7].
IOS has no moving parts potential failure modes have been eliminated;                regular x-rays have become redundant, minimising direct costs [1,7];         mechanical failure is no longer a root cause of malunion, saving           circa &#163;9000 per patient [1].
Impacts on Practitioners and Professional Services            200+ Surgeon's have received training in new methods of fracture         reduction [1]       The research has challenged the use of radiographs in fracture         assessment [1,5,7].
Using STORM has been shown to shorten operating times by         25-30%.
This signifies an overall saving about 1250-2500 operating room         hours: or at least one operating theatre for one year.
This reduces         costs significantly [1,5,9].
An independent German study [1,5] has shown that using STORM reduces         x-ray exposure by 50%.
It reduces overall cost to the hospital.
More importantly, it reduces overall lifetime exposure for the           surgeon.
The study also demonstrated that using STORM reduces the number of         surgical assistants required [1,5];       reducing the overall cost of the operation.
STORM has been proposed as a preferred method for the super-patella         method of IM nailing beneficial for the treatment of calcaneal fractures         [1,5].
IOS, when compared with a direct comparator (Orthofix), saves a         hospital over 50% of purchase price [1,10].
The in-built fracture healing detection system has been shown to be         effective (a 100+ patient study is to be published) [1,7]; 		       reduction of post-operative complications and pin-site issues means         fracture clinics are shorter [1,7];       reducing total cost to the hospital [1].
