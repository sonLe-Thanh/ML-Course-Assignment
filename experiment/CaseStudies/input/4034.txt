     The impact of the Aston CRISIS Centre's research has been demonstrated at       local (Lincoln), regional (Queensland, Australia, Flanders, BE) and       national (UK) level.
This research has:            Influenced and changed the way in which government agencies deal with         mass decontamination following a CBRN incident.
Influenced the decision process for allocation of resources to respond         to terrorist attacks and natural disasters.
Increased understanding and changed policy and the creation process         for plans regarding preparedness for mass evacuation.
Response to terrorist attacks     This research was used by the UK Fire and Rescue Service (FRS) in its       strategic planning as part of the New Dimension Programme to respond to       natural and man-made disasters (Ref 5.1).
The Fire Service used the       models (Ref 3.1) to evaluate different resource allocation       strategies and effectiveness of the response to incidents and planning       assumptions, across the country and whether to centralise or decentralise       these resources, increasing the awareness, capacity and performance of the       FRS to respond to large-scale disasters.
These models were used until 2009       (Ref 5.3).
Those changes remain in place to this date.
Our research (Ref 3.1) has also changed the process through which       mass decontamination plans are created and evaluated, not only for the FRS       but other agencies as well, as evidenced in the ORCHIDS (Evaluation,       optimisation, trialling and modelling of procedures for mass casualty       decontamination) report by the UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) (Ref         5.2).
The HPA's report mentions: "As a result of training and         operational experience, the mass decontamination procedures have         changed... since, and also ... due to, the work of Albores &amp; Shaw         (2008)" (Ref 5.2).
The Australian Government has used these models to inform emergency       response to CBRN attacks (2008) and increase awareness in the "Disposition         of current resources and the linkages from a specific location to         regional, state and national [levels], Comparing levels of preparedness         against service delivery options, applying the models in at least two         states... to allow comparative studies and build a national situational         awareness."
(Ref 5.4)     Mass evacuation     ERGO research (Refs 3.2-3.6) has changed the way in which policies       are set at different levels of government.
For example, the Lincolnshire       Local Resilience Forum (LRF), mentioned:     "This research (Ref 3.6) conducted by Aston         University CRISIS Centre, identifies how vulnerable people can be         supported in their evacuation preparations in case of a         flood...producing a series of recommendations which centred on providing         better information to the public (e.g.
evacuation routes, encouraging         effective two-way communication between residents and officials, and         conducting practice evacuations from floods."
(Ref 5.5)         pp.30     Following the implementation of the recommendations, including the       targeted information campaign, the attitudes, awareness and behaviour of       the population changed:     "The number of people who said they felt quite or very prepared for         flooding increased from 39.7% to 49.3%, but importantly, the results         showed that more people had actually taken action."
(Ref 5.5)       pp.
26     The same report, when presenting the work done by Aston (Ref 3.2)3.2,       highlights the benefits in response capability: "The following key         innovations, research and good practice from the programme are         highlighted not only because they make a significant contribution to the         7 ECIG (East Coast Inundation Group) outcomes, but they also contribute         to the wider UK capabilities programme."
(Ref 5.5) pp.

Another example of the impact of the ERGO research is the use of the EPAW       (Ref 3.6) as an audit tool and benchmark against which to evaluate       current procedures.
This evidence is presented in the UK Department for       Communities and Local Government (DCLG) resilience newsletter (Ref 5.6).
"Lincolnshire LRF undertook a comprehensive process to           assess their preparedness for mass evacuation in the event         of coastal flood.
They used work developed by Aston           University  ... to identify and prioritise         future partnership work to close any remaining gaps in the LRF's capabilities           and capacity to do so... Lincolnshire LRF reviewed           their policies, plans and structures with category 1 and 2         responders and discussed how they stood up to the standards as defined         by ERGO... Lincolnshire LRF recommend this         approach to local resilience forums, as the external standards as         defined in ERGO are an excellent reference point ..." (Ref 5.6)       pg.
9 (This impact occurred in 2011-2012)     Social marketing campaigns around nuclear installations in the region of       Flanders, Belgium were redesigned as a direct result of this research (Ref         5.6).
(Impact occurred 2011-2012)     The project team is working with the British Standards Institute and are       involved with the International Standards Organisation (ISO) to       develop a Standard for preparing for mass evacuation (Ref 5.7).
This directly builds on the ERGO Project research and the Standard is       being based to a large extent on our findings (Refs 3.2-3.6) as       shown by the similarities between Figure 1 above and Figure 1 in the       Standard.
