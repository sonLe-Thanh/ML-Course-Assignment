     The research carried out in Malaysia impacted on capacity development       across all sporting nations.
It has had specific impact in Malaysia where       the research was carried out, however, this research established a process       that has led to the wider adoption of the capacity building of NSAs       throughout the world.
Specifically the NOC of Bosnia and Herzegovina has       implemented a capacity building programme as a direct consequence of this       research and the NOC of Iraq has passed a resolution to adopt this       approach at the end of 2013.
More internationally, in recognition of the       value of the development reports in building capacity, Olympic Solidarity,       the Solidarity Commission of the International Olympic Committee has       developed a platform to make the capacity development process followed in       this research available to NSAs worldwide.
In Malaysia, the research has led to the following impacts:            A set of development actions has been established from the report by         the Olympic Council of Malaysia in order to guide future planning for         the NSAs: In response to the report, the OCM developed an action         plan that is being used to help with the development of the NSAs.
The         Hon Secretary of the OCM noted that "the OCM Strategic Committee should         study and where appropriate include them as part of OCM's Strategic Plan         under the section `Developing the capacity of NSAs'".
All NSAs have computers and access to information technology: The         research showed that some NSAs lacked access to computers and         information technology.
This was impacting on their ability to promote         themselves, communicate with stakeholders, manage their finances         properly and to establish and run competitions.
OCM has now provided all         NSAs with computers, which will support the requirements of all 5 key         recommendations.
"Already 2 NSAs, namely the Malaysian Weightlifting         Federation and the Malaysian Gymnastics Federation, have applied for a         grant to purchase computers.
In addition, the Report has identified 10         NSAs without computers.
OCM should purchase the computers from a grant         from the OCM Trust Fund and present them to the NSAs concerned."
(Hon Secretary, Olympic Council of Malaysia)       OCM training programmes have been revised in order to meet the needs         identified in the report.
An evaluation of the training and development         that OCM offers has been carried out and a new set of programmes for         attracting participants from the NSAs have been developed.
"A comprehensive evaluation of the courses by OCM should be carried           within the next month by Ms. Moira Tan and a new programme for           attracting participants from NSAs should be started in 2012."
(Hon Secretary, Olympic Council of Malaysia)          As stated above, this research has provided the platform for capacity       development on an international scale.
Details of the research carried out       in Malaysia setting out evidence of its ability to bring about capacity       development, in particular the role of the development reports, were       presented to a workshop of NOC managers in Lausanne in September 2012.
As       a consequence, the capacity development process has been implemented in       the NSAs of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"So far we have evaluated 22 national federations and the feedback is, on       one side rather pessimistic because the results are not rather good, but       on the other side, just the process of evaluation served a lot to       understand the state of our NFs, but for the Secretaries General of these       federations to understand what their main problems are."
(Vice- President,       Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina)     More importantly, this capacity building process is considered by Olympic       Solidarity as the main mechanism by which they will facilitate the       development of Olympic sport organisations in the future.
As a       consequence, Olympic Solidarity have adopted the RAT and have developed a       platform that will make the capacity building process set out here       available to all National Olympic Committees in order to develop NSAs       world-wide.
Training and support will be provided by the research team.
"...The intention is that they can use the RAT to guide them to develop       as organisations, by using the Rat to produce a development plan along the       lines of that produced for the Malaysian National Federations."
(Head of NOC Management Programmes, Olympic Solidarity)     Other impacts have been initiated and will be on-going.
Within Malaysia,       as recommended by the research, operations manuals are in the process of       being prepared by the General Manager of OCM and will be used to       standardise the operations of the NSAs.
In addition, the NOC of Iraq has       passed a motion to adopt the Readiness Assessment Tool and as noted by the       Director General, National Olympic Committee of Iraq will use the capacity       building process "as part of [their] planning for the coming four years."
