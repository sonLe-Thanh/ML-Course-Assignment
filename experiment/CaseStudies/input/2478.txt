     Impact on Policy       The research has had a direct and profound impact on European policy.
Member States are now       required to ensure that the Axis 2 (Sustainable Land Management) element       of their 2007-2013       Rural Development Programmes (RDPs) are targeted at "...biodiversity and       preservation of high       nature value farming and forestry systems, water and climate change".
As       part of this       prioritisation, the EU requires that all 28 Member States (and parts       thereof) need to:            Identify the extent and characteristics of the HNV farming systems         occurring within their         Member State/region [5.1].
Identify what steps they are taking to support and maintain HNV         farming, especially through         Rural Development Programmes (RDPs).
Monitor changes to the area of land covered by HNV farming systems         (and the nature values         associated with HNV farming) as part of their monitoring of RDPs.
The requirement for action at a Member State level meant we advised the       Scottish Government in       2009 on how to establish how much HNV farming occurs in Scotland and how       to track trends in       such systems [5.1].
Since 1995, we have made a significant contribution to the dissemination       of findings from the       research described above via a range of media (e.g.
refereed publications,       popular articles and       newsletters, conference proceedings and workshop outputs, technical       reports, policy briefings) to       European scientists and policy makers [5.2].
The resulting awareness of       the pressures being       placed on HNV farming systems, and their associated habitats and species,       both stimulated and       informed the publication in 2004 of a European Environment Agency/United       Nations Environment       Programme report [5.3].
This was the first report published by an agency       or Directorate within the       European Commission to implicitly call for CAP measures specifically       targeted at HNV farming       systems.
Subsequent research commissioned by the European Environment Agency in       2003 and DG       Agriculture in 2006 underpinned the decision of the European Commission to       make HNV farming       systems a policy priority in the 2007-2013 EU Rural Development Programme       [5.4].
The research       also informed the development of DG Agriculture Guidance to Member States       as to how best to       approach identifying and targeting HNV farming systems [5.5] and       associated European       Commission Joint Research Centre estimates of where HNV farming systems       were most likely to       occur across Europe [5.6].
We have therefore had a leading role in providing evidence to the       European Commission, EU       Member States and international and national nature conservation NGOs,       resulting in them       recognising that:            Agricultural policy and market and social pressures are increasingly         making HNV farming         systems economically unviable.
Any resulting intensification or abandonment of such farming systems         would adversely         impact on the land's high nature conservation value.
There is a justifiable case for directing additional financial support         to these systems to help         maintain HNV farms.
Impact on the Economy       It is currently estimated that HNV farming systems are still being       practiced on 30% (i.e.
52 million       ha) of the agricultural land across the EU [5.7] and that between &#8364;10 and       &#8364;16 billion per year       would be required to maintain and support those systems effectively [5.8].
The current total spend       on the CAP is &#8364;53 billion per year.
This research has therefore focused       attention on the need to       target a significant proportion of future CAP spend towards HNV farming       systems in order to       maintain the associated wildlife considered to be of high nature       conservation value.
