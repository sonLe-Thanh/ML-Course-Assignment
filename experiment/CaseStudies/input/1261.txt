     Beal's research into the history of English in the Late Modern period       (1700-1945) and into dialect and identity in the North of England has       changed public understanding of the relationships between language       development, identity and local dialect, and she is now regarded as a       leading expert in this field.
Her work with the collections in the       Archives of Cultural Tradition established the reputation of the School of       English at the University of Sheffield as a centre for the study of       dialect and local identity, which has aided the dissemination and reach of       her work.
Impact on education     One important area of impact has been on the teaching of English Language       in schools.
Knowledge of language change is part of the English Language       curriculum in primary and secondary schools, and outputs from Beal's       research have been extensively used by teachers and students.
Beal's Language         and Region [R6] is part of Routledge's `Intertext' series, developed       as text-books for A-level English language.
It has been recommended by AQA       in their Teacher Resource Bank [S3].
Beal's research is also acknowledged       as an influence on the development of `All Talk', a BT-sponsored resource       for the spoken language component of GCSE English launched in 2011 [S4,       S5].
In a downloadable reading list on this website, Language and         Region is recommended as a key book to teachers.
'All Talk' went out       to every maintained school in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (well       over 4,000).
This resource was short-listed for a 2012 Nominet Internet       Award and, as of 31 July 2013, had 5,643 subscribed members.
Beal's 2004       monograph English in Modern Times [R5] is also used to teach the       component on language change for A-Level English language.
As one of the       senior examiners for AQA writes, `Professor Beal's work on language and         region, exemplified by her Intertext book on this topic, has been very         supportive of 16-19 English Language study.
Her work has offered school         and college English departments some invaluable resources.
It has also         informed assessment work by examination boards: for example, A Level         English Language examiners at AQA have drawn insights from her work in         order to construct their examination papers' [S2].
Beal's books, Language and Region, Introduction to Regional         Englishes, English in Modern Times, and The English         Language (2012), are also key texts for undergraduate courses, used       in HEIs across the UK (e.g.
Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle, Sussex, UCL) and       Europe (including Bergen, Freiburg, Santiago de Compostela, Trento,       Uppsala).
As one reviewer commented of Language and Region, `it         brings the study of dialect in line with the global realities of the         present day, and [...], in doing so, it exposes undergraduates to         functions of dialect within popular culture, tourism and even marketing';       the book is praised for being `practical throughout, aiming at making         students aware of the features, functions and uses of their own local         dialect and even helping them take the first steps in research on the         field' (Juan Camilo Conde Silvestre, Atlantis Journal, 29.1,       2007).
Impact on educational policy     Beal's standing in the field, and the acknowledged importance of her work       as teaching resources, led to her appointment in 2012 as a consultant to       AQA on curriculum reform, reviewing the national content of the A-Level in       English Language and working to improve transition planning between       post-sixteen and undergraduate courses.
Beal delivered the keynote address       at AQA's stakeholder conference in September 2012.
The Head of English at       AQA [S1] acknowledges the impact on their policy of the insight that Beal       provided into historical perceptions of &#8212; and approaches to &#8212; linguistic       `correctness', and to the teaching and assessment of grammar.
This       historicised context (which shows how grammatical rules are continually       shifting and contested) has led to AQA rethinking how linguistic       competency is assessed; in particular, they are committed to considering a       candidate's ability to apply (rather than simply replicate) grammatical       rules and to developing more progressive and creative ways of doing this       (e.g.
through disambiguation of different meanings).
Economic impact for publishers     Beal's books on language are written with a wide readership in mind and,       as a result, have wide appeal.
To 31 July 2013, Language and Region       had, for example, sold over 1,440 copies in paperback.
Impact on public understanding of issues of language and identity     Research into dialect and identity is of considerable interest outside       the academy, and Beal's public profile is evidence of her standing as a       leading authority on dialect and identity in the UK.
She was a member of       the advisory panel for the British Library's `Voices of the UK' project       (2009-12), which makes publicly available significant amounts of data from       a nationwide survey of spoken English since the 1950s, for non-specialist       users as well as trained researchers.
Beal played a crucial role in       advising the curators of this project about the description,       transcription, and interpretation of vernacular speech data.
Material from       `Voices of the UK' archive, and interpretative information about it,       featured prominently in the British Library's Evolving English       exhibition (2010-11), the first exhibition to explore the English language       in its national and international diversity.
The British Library's Lead       Curator for Sociolinguistics &amp; Education [S8] acknowledges the way       that Beal's contribution to the exhibition content ensured that the `interpretation         had credibility'.
The exhibition attracted 147,419 visitors (the       third highest attendance ever for a British Library Exhibition, and the       highest attendance for a winter show by a considerable margin).
Beal also       participated in the accompanying public events programme.
Her public       lecture `Cuddy-wifters, cack-handers and coochies: a celebration of       regional English' was sold out (attendance of 255) and attracted a very       broad audience.
It was also podcast, via the website (151,556 unique       visitors) for the duration of the exhibition and was thus available to a       worldwide audience.
Beal is regularly consulted by national and local radio to explicate       issues of dialect and identity.
Recent programmes include Down off the         Pedestals (BBC Radio 4, 2011), in which Beal featured in       conversation with the poet Simon Armitage about the nineteenth-century       poet Samuel Laycock, who wrote in Lancashire dialect; this programme was       also available on the BBC website as a podcast.
Beal's research has attracted attention in the local and national press,       thus raising awareness of the importance of dialect to local identity and       acting as a counterpoint to research and media coverage that emphasises       the loss and levelling of dialects.
The reach of Beal's research is       further enabled by her accessible style and lack of pretension.
For       instance, Beal's 2009 article on the Arctic Monkeys, originally published       in an academic, peer-reviewed journal (R4), was subsequently the subject       of articles in the Sheffield Star, Yorkshire Post and Independent       newspapers as well as featuring on Arctic Monkeys' fan forums: they quote       her arguing, for instance, that `If there's somebody as prominent as         Alex Turner using a certain accent, it attracts attention [...] Nobody         knew what it meant before, but thanks to them words like "mardy" are         being used nationally' [S9].
In April 2009, she was interviewed by       Ben Leach of the Telegraph on the matter of whether a well-known       singer (Cheryl Cole) should modify her accent in order to succeed in the       USA [S10].
The story was picked up by local and national newspapers from       the Sunday Sun in Newcastle to The Sun, Telegraph,         Metro, and The Scotsman, as well as The Herald       (Ireland).
It was also the subject of comment on several fan websites who       admired her defence of the singer/celebrity's Geordie accent.
In sum, against the grain of accepted narratives of centralisation,       standardisation, and globalisation, Beal's work on dialect, accent,       region, and identity has had these specific impacts: it has helped to       sustain confidence in regional identities and ways of speaking, locally       and nationally; it has shaped more responsive methods of assessing       linguistic competence in public examinations; and it has increased public       understanding of the inter-relationship between language and identity.
