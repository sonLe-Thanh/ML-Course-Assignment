     Social sculpture practice, informed by the research insights of Professor       Sacks, has enabled cultural and educational impacts, demonstrated through       working with individuals, communities and NGOs in Europe, USA, China,       South Africa and India, to address issues within the sustainability       agenda.
These benefits are achieved through the application of the       creative methodologies and connective practice enquiry, which evolved       through the projects Exchange Values, University of the Trees, Ort des         Treffens and Earth Forum.
The methodologies not only enable       a direct experience of Beuys' idea `that every human being is an artist'       [5], but communicate a complex epistemological process about the nature of       imagination, knowledge and creative agency, through a simple, but       empowering, participatory practice, useful in the everyday civil society.
Since 1996, twelve venues have invited, funded and used Exchange         Values.
Banana Link prioritized working with Exchange Values,       raising &#163;12,000 [Arts Council England] to present it at three UK venues.
Chief Executive, Banana Link, [See 1] says the project contributed to the       success of their UK fairtrade strategy, and inspired setting up the Geneva       World Banana Forum.
Exchange Values in schools [8] and its incorporation       as a curriculum resource underlines benefits beyond art-world and       academia.
That thousands of people have, for 16 years, listened to the       invisible farmers' voices and dedicated hours to participating in group       processes `at the table' &#8212; in which they explore their sense of themselves       as `producers' as well as their `response-ability' in the global economy &#8212;       is another form of testimony.
People remark on gaining insights into       themselves and society, as well as valuable, new imaginative capacities.
`What am I doing in the world?'
is the question Hanover citizens       were invited to reflect on and discuss through Ort des Treffens       (April-September 2009), commissioned as part of Hannover's `Gartenregion'       Projekt.
Recorded responses were accessible via 50 citywide listening       stations.
In addition to the hundreds of individual citizens,       participating groups included schools, community centres, libraries,       citizens `integration' groups, the Blind School, a philosophy group       [REFLECT], and sustainability NGOs [Transition Towns; Agenda 21].
The       project included several related publications [see Underpinning Research:       Ort des Treffens], public fora and a project website.
The project is       continuing as a Citizens' Initiative and a revised English version of the       `ATLAS' has now become `ATLAS of the Poetic Continent: Pathways in       Ecological citizenship' [132 pages, 2013]     University of the Trees is a global participatory framework -       online and on the ground &#8212; prioritizing experiential knowing and       re-schooling of the senses.
It explores the questions: `what is       knowledge?'
and `how do we know?'
It develops forms and practices       accessible to all, irrespective of education and status, exploring how we       might live in the world without destroying it and each other.
A 'kit' and       other `instruments of consciousness' connecting inner and outer change,       highlight the relationship between imagination and agency, and create       arenas for exploring our relationship to the world and meaningful action.
Processes such as `what is a human being, what is a tree' have been used       with school and young offenders groups [e.g.
Haldon Forest, Exeter],       whilst `exploring questions as trajectories' formed part of a Nobel       Laureates Climate conference.
Such understandings also enrich exchanges       with other initiatives, including environmental groups such as Black       Environment Network and green health networks engaging with       `nature-deficit disorder'.
In 2011 a handbook was drafted for those       facilitating engagement at the Exchange Values' table.
An updated version       incorporates insights from all four projects, in particular Sacks' link       between `aesthetic' practice that overcomes numbness, and our       responsibility as an ability-to-respond (UNESCO Summit contribution,       Stockholm.1998).
Earth Forum is a `module' of the University of the Trees,       developed in a small South African village in 2002, and tested in South       Africa, Germany and the UK since 2011.
It is a mobile, simple,       multi-stakeholder process open to all, highlighting `capacity building' of       a special kind, which people can carry into their work, their NGO       practices [2/3/4/6/8/9] and their daily lives [10].
Although designed to       bring together groups of stakeholders that have differing ideas of       `progress', `development' and `a sustainable future' it can also be used       meaningfully with groups of individuals, as in Berlin [6].
Through its       connective practices it enables new forms of meeting, listening, creative       engagement and action.
Since May 2011, when Sacks trained the first small       team of Earth Forum `responsible participants', nearly two thousand people       in South Africa, Germany, UK, India and Portugal have participated in       Earth Forum's intensive 3-hour process.
Of these, 73 requested training to       become `responsible participants'.
These facilitators meet regularly to       discuss the Earth Fora that they run in many different constituencies       -from advocacy groups, the Commons network, Transition Towns, within       permaculture and activist training, to festivals and events in city       squares &#8212; demonstrating that this process is valued and widely used.
Its       impact in Berlin resulted in further funding from the Bundeszentral fuer       Politische Bildung [National Office for Political Education] for another       weeklong Earth Forum programme (2013), facilitated by 6 of the original       2012 Earth Forum participants.
