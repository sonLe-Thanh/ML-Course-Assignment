     The body of research undertaken by Prof Rowland and colleagues:     (a) is being used by oil companies such as BP, Chevron, Total and others       to monitor and model       oil pipeline problems,     (b) has significantly helped in enhancing the understanding of policy       makers of environmental       pollution from supercomplex mixtures of organic chemicals (e.g.
Environment Canada) and     (c) has influenced public debate and engagement with scientific issues       concerning maritime       transport and spills of chemical pollutant mixtures (e.g.
questions in UK       parliament).
Applications arising from oil pipeline fouling have resulted in grants of       a GB patent and PCT       patents pending.
A sophisticated computer model of oil pipeline fouling       for a consortium       including BP, Total, Chevron and others, is being developed by UK       companies, InfoChem and       OIlPlus Ltd, using the analytical data provided by Rowland's team.
Indirectly, all of these data       benefit all those societies that use petroleum as an energy source.
The       methods are used       routinely by Rowland's lab for a number of international oil companies on       a regular basis (for       example for high wax up to C100 compounds); much of this is, however,       `commercial in       confidence' but can be provided on a confidential basis for audit purposes       if required.
The environmental pollution issues have resulted in patents pending in       GB, USA and Canada (as       listed in Section 5 below).
These are concerned with improved methods of       pollutant monitoring       developed by Rowland's team, particularly applicable in Canada.
This helps       to better address, for       example, the call for the addition of unresolved mixtures of naphthenic       acids pollutants to the       National Pollutant Release Inventory in Canada (Proposal by Environmental       Defence to Add       Naphthenic Acids to the NPRI, available &lt; http://www.ec.gc.ca/inrp-npri/default.asp?lang=en&amp;n=AC708134-1&gt;       accessed 12 October 2012).
Since issues with oil       sands imports are also on the EU political agenda, in 2011 the European       Environment Agency       funded a lecture from Rowland on these and related emerging contaminants.
The development and       validation of the novel analytical methods has seen their uptake as the       methods of choice by       Environment Canada and for Rowland, funded visits and consultations       by Environment Canada       and the Canadian Water Network and presentations at numerous EU       institutions including the       European Environment Agency and the European Centre for         Environment &amp; Human Health.
Professor Rowland's laboratory is recognised as the leading laboratory in       the field of       characterisation of unresolved pollutants including naphthenic acids, as       endorsed by unsolicited       statements by U.S. and Australian government non-academic scientists       (Reddy, Wood's Hole, USA       and Volkman, CSIRO Australia) in plenary lectures at international       meetings in the EU and USA in       2011.
A written statement from an Environment Canada scientist confirms       "From the perspective of         scientists such as myself and colleagues at Environment Canada, the         research that Professor         Steven Rowland's group at the Plymouth University has done into         establishing methods to identify         and measure complex mixtures of organic chemicals has had a significant         impact on our         understanding of the possible fate and effects of the multibillion         dollar oil sands industries on the         Canadian environment.
The work provided the first real evidence of what         naphthenic actually are &#8212; and         has established which of the chemicals provide the most toxic threats to         organisms, including         fish.
This topic is of immense public, political and sociological         concern in North America, as         demonstrated by press and TV, as well as more formal government reports...."     Rowland's studies of unresolved pollutant mixtures allowed his team to       identify two `mystery' spills       which killed thousands of seabirds in the UK in 2013.
The substance was a       polyisobutene (PIB)       mixture.
The information was of major assistance to the UK Maritime         &amp; Coastguard Agency and       a senior Counter Pollution Officer has written to thank Rowland for his       help.
As a result of       Rowland's findings, multi wildlife agencies, including the Royal         Society for the Protection of Birds       and the RSPCA have issued calls, supported by the UK Chamber         of Shipping, to the International         Maritime Organisation to review urgently the hazard classification       of PIBs and to implement       regulations that prevent any further incidents (e.g.
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22505544;       13th May 2013).
Meetings of the Bonn Convention partners in       Europe have       discussed the reclassification.
The public weblog petition has received       support from many       thousands of U.K. citizens.
The issue has received very high national and       some international       media coverage including in newspapers such as the Guardian, the BBC       news and a BBC Inside       Out documentary broadcast in September 2013.
Also, the topic has been       taken forward by MPs       seeking a change in the law as well as by numerous environment groups and       the UK Chamber of       Shipping.
Questions have been tabled in UK parliament and public       statements by ministers have       been made.
In short, methods developed by Rowland's team have proved useful for       identifying and measuring       thousands of previously unidentified industrial chemicals and toxic       pollutants across the world; the       `petroleome' is at least partly, resolved.
