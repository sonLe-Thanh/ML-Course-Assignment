     Insights from Belchem's research into Liverpool's culture, identity and       historic exceptionalism have provided important starting points for its       culture-led regeneration, which received a crucial boost in 2008 during       Liverpool's year as European Capital of Culture.
Civil society: Civic leaders were particularly keen to use the       Capital of Culture bid to challenge negative external perceptions of the       city.
As a member of one of the key working groups which helped to prepare       the bid, Belchem was able to foreground Liverpool's historic importance as       a global seaport, its rich history of culture as well as commerce, and its       cosmopolitanism, as central elements in the city's claim for recognition.
The importance of Belchem's input is reflected in the `Executive         Summary of Liverpool's Bid for European Capital of Culture 2008',       which &#8212; echoing a series of Belchem's arguments in Merseypride &#8212;       began by characterising the city as unconventional and pioneering,       reflecting its geographical location "on the edge" (p.101); emphasised its       "800 years of history ... much of it on a world scale" (p. 301);       highlighted the importance of its architectural heritage (p. 901) and       concluded by stressing the city's historic cosmopolitanism (p. 1102).
Belchem's research made a significant contribution to the wider civic       effort to secure Liverpool's nomination.
The impact of this civic       endeavour was manifested during 2008.
The economic impact of Liverpool's       year as European Capital of Culture was estimated         by the City Council at &#163;800m, with a total audience for the year-long         programme of events of 15 million (statistics cited drawn from pp.
6, 9).
Public discourse: As the national media focused its attention on       Liverpool throughout 2008, Belchem was frequently called upon to comment       on the city's historic identity and the cultural legacy of its       exceptionalism.
He used these invitations to raise public awareness and       understanding of Liverpool's rich cultural heritage, thus contributing       directly to the broader campaign to use 2008 to dispel negative external       perceptions of the city and its people.
To this end, Belchem made a series of appearances on BBC Radio 4, including     `You and Yours' (discussion of the Liverpool Irish, 13 February 2008);     `Archive Hour' (`Liverpool: Sinner and Saint', 20 August 2008); and `The     Trouble with Scousers' (17 September 2008).
He also contributed to a     television film which explored Liverpool's `apartness'.
`Passport to     Liverpool', which took as its central premise Belchem's observation in Merseypride     that Liverpool was in England but not of it, was broadcast     on BBC4 (18 August 2008; repeated 9 May 2010), having been premiered at the     Philharmonic Hall in Liverpool on 20 April 2008 as part of the Capital of     Culture programme.
While it is not possible to measure the influence of     specific programmes, the wider campaign to change external perceptions of     Liverpool during 2008 to which Belchem made a substantial contribution &#8212;     through his succession of media appearances &#8212; met with demonstrable success.
The Impacts 08 study, Creating         an Impact: Liverpool's Experience as European Capital of Culture,     found that British national newspapers carried 71% more positive stories     about Liverpool during 2008 than they had done during 2007, while surveys of     impressions of Liverpool among the broader UK population (outside North-West     England) found that the proportion of positive impressions rose from 53% to     60% between 2005 and 2008 (statistics cited drawn from pp.
40, 46).
Public services/policy making: Belchem's contribution to the       success of Liverpool's year as European Capital of Culture was reflected       in an invitation to provide expert testimony at a workshop held in Lublin,       Poland (2010) organised as part of the HerO       (Heritage as Opportunity) project, funded under the EU's flagship Urbact       II initiative.
(This trans-european programme, involving 29 countries and       over 700 cities, was designed to foster the sharing of best practice, with       the goal of working together to solve major urban challenges).
Belchem was       also invited as an internationally recognised expert to the `After the       Cultural City Conference' held in Pecs, Hungary (2010) for representatives       from cities bidding for future ECoC status.
Belchem's presentation       outlined insights from his research into Liverpool's history, and       reflected on the subsequent delivery of its Capital of Culture programme.
Audiences at these events were primarily non- academic: civic officials,       heritage professionals, architects and town planners.
Cultural life: While continuing to work on the Steering Group for       Liverpool's World Heritage Site, Belchem has also worked closely with       National Museums Liverpool (NML), especially during the transformation of       the Museum of Liverpool Life into the new Museum of Liverpool, which       opened in 2011.
Belchem served on the Museum's Advisory Group from 2006,       and his body of work on Liverpool identity, in-migration, Irishness,       radicalism and cultural capital has directly and substantially informed       the content of the new Museum's permanent galleries.
According to the       Museum's Director: "the team working on the museum were influenced by       [Belchem's] ideas of `Merseypride' and [his] Irish diaspora research"       (email dated 04/03/2013).
In its first eighteen months, the Museum had 1.7       million visitors.
Huge public interest helped NML to achieve record-       breaking visitor figures in 2011-12 (Annual         Report, p. 7) and again in 2012-13 (Annual         Report, p. 8).
In April 2013, the Museum of Liverpool was awarded       the Council         of Europe Museum Prize for 2013       in recognition of its exceptional contribution to the understanding of       European cultural heritage.
In 2011, Belchem's research on Edwardian       Liverpool provided the historical context for `City         of Radicals', a year-long centenary programme of exhibitions, events       and publications exploring events in Liverpool in 1911, and their legacy.
Highlights included `Art         in Revolution: Liverpool         1911', an acclaimed       restaging at the Walker Art Gallery of the 1911 Post-Impressionist       exhibition, when Picasso, Matisse, C&#233;zanne and others exhibited at the       city's Bluecoat gallery.
`Art in Revolution' attracted 58,000 visitors       (estimate from NML).
Another impact derived from Belchem's work is the `Liverpool in Print'       project.
The research for Liverpool 800, and the surge of interest       in public history that this project generated, led to a realisation that       the very rich holdings of Liverpool Record Office needed to be made       accessible to researchers on a much more systematic basis.
The `Liverpool       in Print' project saw the creation of a digitised version of the former       local studies sheaf catalogue (a resource collected over decades by       specialist librarians, which had fallen into a state of decay by 2006).
This is now integrated with the general         online catalogue of Liverpool Record Office.
Between August 2009 and       March 2013 the `Liverpool in Print' online urban bibliography was hosted       separately on a server at the University of Liverpool.
During that time,       it attracted more than 13,000 unique visitors and 146,000 page views       (Google Analytics Report).
One lay user (a former librarian) commented:       "This is such an advance on what was previously available - a single copy       of an old fashioned, scruffy, sheaf catalogue, which could only be       consulted in person, in Liverpool Record Office.
It is now possible to       search remotely for material on all aspects of Liverpool and the       surrounding area.
I am presently writing a book on Liverpool history and       find it an invaluable resource" (email dated 17/04/2013).
Liverpool         800 has been adopted as a model for other urban anniversary       histories, including Belfast 400: People, Place and History       (Liverpool University Press, 2012).
