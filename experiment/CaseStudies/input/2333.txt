     Our review of chlamydia control activities in Europe was commissioned by       the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) to inform       development of its policy.
The resulting policy document, ECDC Guidance on       Chlamydia Control in Europe 2009 [a], states that the guidance was       developed by a technical expert group using the evidence gathered in the       EU report "Review of chlamydia control activities in EU countries" [b]       and systematic review of the effectiveness of chlamydia screening [6,         above].
It provides guidance to health policy makers in the EU about       national strategies for chlamydia control.
The systematic review of chlamydia screening was commissioned by NICE to       inform its guidance [c].
Our findings indicated that there was a       lack of evidence from randomised trials to show the effectiveness of       chlamydia screening and the final NICE Guidance made no recommendations       about chlamydia screening except for more robust research to examine the       effectiveness of different screening approaches [d].
This       recommendation contributed to decisions to fund two large randomised       trials &#8212; one in the Netherlands of a register based screening programme       and one in Australia of an opportunistic screening programme.
The research       in the Netherlands concluded "There was no statistical evidence of an         impact on chlamydia positivity rates or estimated population prevalence         from the Chlamydia Screening Implementation programme after three years         at the participation levels obtained.
The current evidence does not         support a national roll out of this register based chlamydia screening         programme" [e].
The systematic review had a persistent       influence on development of chlamydia screening policy nationally and       internationally.
Our research into chlamydia screening had wide impact, as it contributed,       through informed and constructive criticism, to public debate about the       National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP) in England and its future       direction.
Stephenson presented insights gained from the research to the       annual NCSP meeting (2007) and to the Independent Advisory Group at the       House of Lords (2008) [f].
She was among the experts who gave       evidence at interview to the National Audit Office for their report on       value for money of the NCSP (NAO 2009).
She highlighted that since the       NCSP did not use unique identifiers or collect any clinical outcome data,       it was not able to evaluate its aims.
The NAO report cites both our review       of chlamydia control activities in EU countries and the subsequent ECDC       Guidance on chlamydia control in Europe [g].
It concluded that the       delivery of the NCSP had not demonstrated value for money.
In accordance       with our research findings, it stated that "due to uncertainties in the         scientific evidence on chlamydia, the Department does not know how often         infection leads to serious health problems and hence whether it is         cost-effective to invest so much public money in tackling this problem."
The NAO Report was swiftly followed by a highly critical report from the       Public Accounts Committee (2009-2010) [h].
In response to this       criticism, the NCSP focused on chlamydia testing in sexual health services       and primary care and has ceased screening in low risk groups that       identifies fewer positive cases [i].
These and other       organisational changes are expected to substantially improve value for       money.
Between 2003 and 2009, c.&#163;100m was spent delivering the programme [h]       and cost savings on reconfiguration are expected to be considerable: "The         average cost per chlamydia screening episode (including follow up of         positive clients, overheads and local coordination) was found to be         &#163;45... An estimated cost of &#163;33 per screening episode should be         achievable, as screening volumes increase, chlamydia screening is better         integrated in all community sexual health pathways, sexual health         networks develop and regions move to collaborative procurement" [j].
While mathematical models tend to predict that screening will reduce the       prevalence of infection, there is currently no empirical evidence from the       NCSP to demonstrate a fall in prevalence.
The latest (April 2013) update       on the National Chlamydia Screening Programme acknowledges the gaps in       current knowledge that our research highlighted and describes a new policy       of re-focusing chlamydia testing within health services, moving away from       population-based screening with coverage targets [k].
Reflecting on changes in chlamydia screening policy, Stephenson was       invited to present a plenary debate at the world congress of sexually       transmitted infections (Vienna, July 2013) on whether to abandon       population based chlamydia screening of asymptomatic young women [l].
