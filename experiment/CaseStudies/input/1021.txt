       The Social Action approach has had consequences and has made a distinct         contribution outside the academic community.
The impact of the Social         Action is diverse, has a significant number of beneficiaries at a         variety of levels and is extensive with considerable reach and         significance.
The Social Action approach, which can be applied in both         research and practice, has underpinned the provision of wide-ranging         consultancy, applied research and training to voluntary and statutory         agencies in the UK, and internationally, giving both breadth and depth         to the impact of Social Action.
For example, during the assessment         period, Social Action has impacted upon local council policy in relation         to community cohesion and resilience, the design of evolving voluntary         and statutory social and youth services in countries of the former         Soviet Union through partnerships with international NGOs and national         government departments, the development of student directed learning in         the United States through a long collaboration with the National Writing         Project (a national professional development agency for teachers), and         informed the training of 200 young people in South Africa to undertake         peer research exploring the community support for young people affected         by HIV/AIDs.
In the JISC funded DIEGO (Disseminating Impact from         Engagement with user Groups and Organisations 2011-12) project Fleming         linked with Impact Analysts from University of Edinburgh to look         specifically at the impact of participatory research in the area of         Social Action; this project applied a previously developed impact         approach to analyse and evaluate the impact of participatory research         and created two case studies evidencing the impact of our work in         relation to Teenage Pregnancy in Leicester and children's services in         Ukraine.
The following specific areas illustrate the reach and significance of         the outcomes of our research:         International impact: (a) America The CSA has a         long-standing formal and active partnership with the National Writing         Project at the University of California, Berkeley.
Fleming worked with         the organisation and its teacher members for a number of years to         explore the application of Social Action in the classroom setting.
This         partnership culminated in the publication in 2006 of `Writing for a         Change: Boosting Literacy and Learning Through Social Action' (Berdan et         al, 2006), which won the 2007 annual award of the American Society of         Educational Publishers for the most outstanding materials in the field         of teaching and learning, which has sold over 6,000 copies.
This book is         used as a key text at the University of Massachusetts on their Civic         Engagement course and is the basis of their service learning projects.
Social Action training delivered as part of this collaboration was         utilised by one particular teacher (Kristina Berdan) who has worked with         groups of pupils in her Baltimore school over many years.
Ultimately         they opened their own young-people led community youth centre &#8212; Youth         Dreamers.
Youth Dreamers has impacted positively on the lives of over         500 young people over a period of some 10 years by providing a safe         haven with opportunities for youth to accomplish personal goals, develop         leadership potential and participate in improving their communities.
(b) Moldova Fleming and Weich (SL in social work and associate         of CSA) have been engaged as international experts on the Social         Services strand of the `Support to the Delivery of Effective and         Sustainable Social Assistance Services in Moldova'.
Funded by the UK's         Deptartment for International Development and Swedish International         Development Cooperation Agency, this project aimed to support the         development of the newly created post of Community Social Assistant.
We         provided consultancy for the development of job descriptions for the         social assistants, ensured service user involvement, and contributed to         the development of primary social care legalisation adopted by the         Government of Moldova in December 2008.
We developed a participative         training strategy and curriculum for training that is being rolled out         nationally.
The CSA's work on participation and community development is         central to the curriculum and materials written by Fleming and Weich         for inclusion in manuals produced by the Moldovan Ministry of Social         Protection Family and Child.
By the end of the census period (i.e.
31st         July 2013) ca.
1000 social assistants and their supervisors had received         training based on the curriculum and manuals.
This work has had an         impact on the 800 community social assistants and hence an estimated 170         000 beneficiaries of their services.
National impact: Standards We Expect Project This Joseph         Rowntree funded consortium project on the subject of person-centred         support utilised the Social Action research methodology.
A guide for         practitioners was one of a range of academic and non-academic outputs at         the end of the project (Croft S, Bewley C, Beresford P, Branfield F, Fleming           J, Glynn M, Postle K (2011) Person-Centred Support: A guide to         person centred working for practitioners, Shaping Our Lives in         association with Joseph Rowntree Foundation).
The action points in this         guide were used to create a poster published in Community Care and sent         to all social workers by The College of Social Work.
The guide is         accessible on a number of different websites, and in March 2013 it         received between 80-120 views from at least four different countries         each week on Fleming's academia.edu page alone indicating its         popularity as a practice resource.
The findings from this project were         subject to a Guardian Roundtable focusing on the funding of social care         with subsequent reporting in the Society pages of The Guardian         (10/8/11) and the press more widely.
Local impact Leicester City Council &#8212; Leicester teenage         pregnancy prevention (LTPP) strategy 2006/7 onwards.
LCC commissioned         the CSA to undertake the Leicester teenage pregnancy prevention (LTPP)         strategy evaluation.
The report contributed to better informed public         policy and to improved services.
It has been influential, informing the         commissioning of new services.
The teenage pregnancy rate in Leicester         has reduced.
The project was included in a guide produced by Involve         (national advisory group to support greater involvement of public in         health and social care research) as an example of good participatory         research practice.
Leicester City Council &#8212; Survey of Leicester (2006 - 2013) Through the         work of Boeck, the CSA have had a long-standing partnership with         Leicester City Council.
Most recently introducing our participatory         methods into the Council's `Survey of Leicester'.
This generated a         better understanding of how residents perceive their communities and         therefore identify local issues that are important in different areas         for different communities.
This process actively engaged with a diverse         group of Leicester's residents and explored people's attitudes towards a         survey and identified different ways to best administer it.
The         partnership work and participatory process had a substantial impact on         the work of the `research and intelligence' team of Leicester city         council.
As a result of this and other work done with the council,         several departments have integrated a stronger focus on the capacity of         individuals and communities to respond to challenges, and to `absorb'         and `bounce back' in a way that maintains or even enhances wellbeing         within their remit.
This is a substantial shift away from perspectives         which only look at deficits within communities, stressing         vulnerabilities rather than resilience.
