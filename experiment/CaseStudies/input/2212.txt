     Newcastle research into stochastic models for environmental hazards has       revolutionised capabilities and practice in the design and planning of       resilient infrastructure systems.
The use of stochastic methods allows       much larger and more detailed data sets of hazards (e.g.
extreme       rainfall, droughts, and wind storms) to be generated for present and       future climates providing a more robust basis for risk and reliability       assessments.
These assessments include expected damages from flood,       failure of water supply and damage to infrastructure networks from       multiple environmental hazards, which inform plans and designs for       resilient infrastructure systems adapted to future climates.
The impact of the research has been achieved through two main impact       routes a) the provision of the "Weather Generator" (WG) software       encompassing new methods as part of the UKCP09 used for climatic risk       assessments, and b) the provision of a tailored model for water resource       planning.
a) Impact through the Weather Generator: Research at       Newcastle into stochastic rainfall models underpins the web-based WG       software [E5] technical details of which are published in the DEFRA report       [E8].
This work uses both the NSRP rainfall model [P1, P4] and methods for       downscaling future climate [P2, P3].
The WG was initially developed for       the Environment Agency (EA) funded EARWIG project and further developed       for DEFRA's official UK Climate Projections (UKCP09).
The free and online       provision of WG has made new, more robust methods for risk assessment of       climate change, floods and droughts available to a wide user-base where       previously it was restricted to academic research or highly specialised       consultancy.
This accessibility has resulted further in the transformation       of industry and academic best practice in design and planning of resilient       infrastructure systems across multiple sectors e.g.
energy       utilities &amp; transport operators.
Specific beneficiaries include:            National government (DEFRA &amp; EA) were responsible for the UKCP09         programme.
The first national Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) in         2012 used WG [E5] as detailed in the water sector report [E1, pp 12, 14,         39, 59, 88].
The CCRA informs national policy through the National           Adaptation Plan which sets out the main priorities for adaptation         for the UK;       Government Office North East commissioned Royal Haskoning to carry out         its Climate Change Adaptation study (2008) which used the WG and won the         Institution of Civil Engineers Stephenson Award for Sustainability         (2009) [E4];       Atkins, one of the world's leading design, engineering and project         management consultancies, uses the WG extensively (since 2009) to         analyse data for their clients, predominantly in the water sector.
Most         notable is the UKWIR (UK Water Industry Research Ltd.) project "Climate           Change Modelling for Sewerage Networks" which resulted in the         provision of guidance on incorporating climate change impacts into the         modelling of sewerage networks [E2, E3]; The software tool "WRAPT"         (which uses WG outputs) commissioned by UKWIR is the new national water         industry standard recommendation.
The principal consultant at Atkins         indicates in [E3] that the UK water industry spent over &#163;1 billion on         reducing the risk of sewer flooding between 2005 and 2010 and that this         will become more significant in the future: "Understanding the risk           &#8212; in the current climate and under climate change projections &#8212; is           vital to ensure appropriate and timely investment.
Analysis using WG           is integral to this" [E3];          Overall uptake of the WG can be gauged by usage statistics which show it       was run 16,132 times by 1338 unique users from 2009 to May 2013 [E5, E6];       a national portfolio of RCUK funded programmes with industrial partners       [E7] who rely on the UKCP09 e.g.
the EPSRC Adaptation and       Resilience in a Changing Climate Coordination Network [E3].
b) Impacts through models for water resource planning:       Stochastic methods have been accepted as a new practice by water industry       companies and used for future investment and asset management planning of       e.g.
reservoirs and water transfers.
One direct beneficiary is       Southern Water (SW) whose consultants, Atkins, have specified and used       stochastic rainfall models and their outputs in driving water resource       models, subsequently used for assessing future requirements and planning       capacity and investment.
The Newcastle research contribution here was in       provision of stochastic rainfall models which were refined and applied       with knowledge from climate downscaling projects [G1,G2] dealing with       droughts to develop computer models for monthly multi-site rainfall [P6]       with realistic extremes and spatial correlation needed for application       across large water resource zones under climate change conditions.
SW's       management plan [E9, pg.6] describes this "innovative approach"       based on pioneering work with Newcastle University using "mathematical         modelling techniques to look at alternative weather patterns and         droughts".
This much more robust approach, "an industry first"       [E10], to possible future drought was used to formulate SW's water       resources management plan submitted to industry regulators, Ofwat.
This       planning case is valued at &#163;283.4 million as SW serves around 4 million       customers and was published in draft for consultation in May 2013 [E9,       E10].
Further developing and international impacts: simulation       methods using stochastic inputs are now becoming standard in international       insurance and re-insurance.
Newcastle enjoys membership of the Willis       Research Network which provides a close relationship with Willis and their       insurance and re-insurance clients.
Newcastle has developed rainfall       models to generate large-scale extreme daily rainfall fields for Willis,       who are developing a large basin flood model to be driven with ensembles       of synthetic rainfall data.
Insured losses of around &#8364;400 million were       estimated from flooding in Austria due to the Danube in the last major       flood event and improved models and flood risk estimates at greater       resolution and with higher accuracy will allow significant improvement in       premium setting and avoidance of costly over-exposure.
Collaborations with       partners for international WG applications are underway with Deutsche       Wetter Dienst (Germany), Global Change Impact Studies Centre (Pakistan)       and Caribbean meteorological agencies (via a Climate and       Development Knowledge Network project funded by DFID8882083).
