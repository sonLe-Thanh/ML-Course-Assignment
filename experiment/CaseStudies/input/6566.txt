     Pollard and Wheatley's research has directly informed local, national and       international World Heritage Site conservation strategies, significantly       contributed to tourist income generation and furthered public       understanding of Neolithic Britain.
This research's unique contribution was recognised in 2009 when the       Longstones Project was highlighted by the Arts and Humanities Research       Council (AHRC) to illustrate `the great diversity and variety of impact       from arts and humanities research' [5.1]; and in 2012 when it was       singled out in the Heritage Action forum as an `example of really good       public engagement' [5.2].
Impact is further evidenced through:     Local economy     The most recent audit of economic impact from the Longstones Project for       AHRC in 2007 estimated archaeological research in the Avebury WHS had       generated an additional &#163;13m of visitor expenditure [5.3].
Although this audit just predates the impact period, such economic benefit       has continued and grown as a result of new work, as evidenced by a steady       rise in visitor numbers from 65,247 in 2008-9 to 86,283 in 2011-12.
In her letter to support this study, Rosamund Cleal, Curator of the       National Trust's (NT's) Alexander Keiller Museum (AKM), said: "the       expectation on the part of the public that research will reveal more       information about the sites and the necessity to draw visitors back to the       site to generate revenue means that there is an ongoing need for       research..." [5.4].
The results of both Southampton projects fed       directly into the creation of displays, interpretative and interactive       devices within AKM's permanent exhibition, accessed by more than 150,000       public visitors since 2008 [5.5].
In 2009 AKM's Stables gallery       was refreshed "drawing substantially on the Longstones Project results...       seeing more than 50,000 visitors across its threshold in (2012-2013)".
As       a pay-for-entry part of the Avebury property, Southampton-led research has       been an important source of revenue for the NT as well as having       contributed to better public understanding and appreciation of Britain's       prehistory [5.4].
Pollard and Wheatley's publications (including 3.1) have been used as       core texts for NT volunteer training since 2008 and form the basis for a       series of NT guided walks within Avebury.
Around 10,000 members of the       public have participated in these walks since 2009, paying &#163;3 each which       goes directly towards care and conservation of the WHS [5.5].
Management     Effective management of the region's internationally significant       prehistoric archaeology is key to maintaining its WHS status.
Southampton       research has directly informed the management strategies of heritage       curators (the National Trust, English Heritage and Wiltshire Council).
It       directs attention to the significance of areas previously overlooked or       not properly understood.
Facilitating a more complete understanding of the       significance of the WHS, this has aided the production of a retrospective       Statement of Outstanding Universal Value (SOUV) adopted by UNESCO's World       Heritage Committee in June 2013 [5.6].
This is now a key document       in planning and development control.
There has been demonstrable impact on management and land-use strategies;       for example:            the Longstones enclosure and Beckhampton Avenue are now targeted as         high priorities within the Avebury WHS Arable Reversion Project (a WHS         `first'), enabling Natural England to target Higher Level Stewardship         scheme funding and protect the area's globally significant archaeology [5.7];       fieldwork by the BtM Project at Rough Leaze highlighted that area's         archaeological sensitivity, leading to the reversal of a decision to         employ that area for solstice festival camping and parking (2008         onwards) [5.5];       research on the Beckhampton Avenue was fundamental in informing         planning responses to developments on Avebury High Street (2009-11)           [5.7];       the results of Longstones research influenced the &#163;500,000 English         Heritage conservation project on Silbury Hill (2007-8) [5.8].
In 2008 Pollard was invited by the Irish Government to speak to key       stakeholders associated with the Br&#250; na B&#243;inne WHS about Avebury       projects as part of their official process to form a new research strategy       [5.9].
Public engagements     Southampton research has been further disseminated through public       lectures, reaching a cumulative audience in excess of 1000 people since       2008 alone.
During the first 6 months of 2013 Pollard contributed interviews       detailing Avebury findings to BBC 2's Sacred Wonders of Britain       and Channel 4's Walking Through History (series 2) [5.10].
The research is acknowledged as providing key sources of information in       books by the novelist Jenni Mills (for The Buried Circle, an       archaeological thriller set in Avebury, HarperCollins, 2009) and Bob       Trubshaw (Beyond the Henge, which explores Avebury's prehistoric       landscape, Albion, 2012).
Immense public interest generated during the Longstones Project was a       catalyst for the production of a collaborative WHS residents information       pack (2008), instrumental in developing local awareness of the work of       archaeologists [3.3].
