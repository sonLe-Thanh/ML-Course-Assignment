     The impact had two main strands; firstly, Loughlin's research directly       influenced the creative practice of the programme maker and secondly, his       insights helped creative professionals and a major broadcasting       organisation adapt to changes in the historical and cultural landscape in       Ireland that, by 2011,       enabled a ground-breaking visit by the British monarch.
RT&#201; made contact       with Loughlin due to the reach of his work and his reputation.
An initial       approach was via the University of Ulster's Press Office, in March 2011.
Loughlin was then contacted directly about his research by the Executive       Producer of the `The Queen and Us' and Northern Editor for RT&#201;.
Loughlin       helped the Producer formulate a series of questions to shape the range,       tone and direction of the programme.
These questions then became the basis       of the Producer's 90-minute-long interview with Loughlin in April 2011.
The research findings presented and recorded at that interview were used       specifically to discuss a number of points that subsequently shaped the       core content of the RT&#201; progamme, `The Queen and Us', which was timed to       coincide with the Queen's visit.
RT&#201;'s Producer was, as a result,       `delighted to acknowledge that your expertise provided the spine for the       programme's narrative' (Email statement, 9 November 2013).
He also       explained the main themes which Loughlin and his work framed (email 31       October 2011):            The history of Anglo-Irish tension from 1800 onwards and the         expectations and disappointments in respect to the Anglo-Irish treaty of         1921 (Loughlin, `Crown, Spectacle and Identity: the British Monarchy and         Ireland under the Union 1800-1922' in Olechnowicz (ed.
), Monarchy           and the British Nation, pp.108-36).
The importance of &#201;ire's neutrality during World War II (Loughlin, British           Monarchy and Ireland, pp.
348-55).
How the war impacted on Princess Elizabeth (Loughlin, British           Monarchy and Ireland, pp.
348-52).
How and why she viewed Ireland through an Ulster prism (Loughlin, British           Monarchy and Ireland, pp.
350-52, 390).
Her visits to Northern Ireland, especially their significance at         different times since 1969 (Loughlin, British Monarchy and Ireland,         pp.
351-2, 355, 358-9, 363-7, 369-76, 381-3).
The significance of the joint visit of the Queen and the Irish         President, Mary McAleese, to the Great War memorial at Messines in         Belgium and its importance in marking a positive change in Anglo-Irish         relations (Loughlin, British Monarchy and Ireland, pp.
379-81).
Whilst interviewing Loughlin provided the spine of the programme,       researchers also made full use of his book and shorter works in       structuring their narrative of Ireland's relationship with the Queen.
Interviewed under the on-screen tag `Dr James Loughlin, Author, The         British Monarchy and Ireland', his input was so singular that the       Producer was able to acknowledge him as `the sole historian to feature in       what was a significant hour of important public service programme'.
Additionally, he added, `as you know, you featured prominently during the       progamme' (email, 13 May 2011; email statement, 9 November 2013; DVD copy       of the programme).
Loughlin thus appeared alongside a list of prominent       interviewees including former US       Senator and Special Envoy to Northern         Ireland, George Mitchell; Prime Minister David Cameron; and       President Mary McAleese.
The wider impact of the programme may be understood in terms of       individual and public understanding of the history and contemporary       relevance of the visit.
The programme was part of a concerted series of       news, media and programming items timed to coincide with the Queen's       visit.
The programme itself, was watched by over 400,000 people when       broadcast on 17 May 2011 (source: Producer's email, 31 October 2011;       statement by email, 8 November 2013).
Programme- maker also corroborated       the programme's audience reach by saying: `Enda Kenny mentioned that the       Palace had watched the broadcast in an interview on the Late Late Show,       on the Friday after the visitors departed' (email, 31 October 2011).
Further public engagement with Loughlin's research for the broadcast was       enabled by the programme being available to a worldwide audience on the       RT&#201; player after Ireland's premier broadcaster granted it `access all       areas' status (email statement, 9 November 2013).
The Producer reported reach beyond the general audience, stating: `Among       those who also commented positively on it were Dr Kevin Cahill, who is       Chief Advisor for Humanitarian Affairs of the President of the UN General       Assembly, Director of the Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs       at Fordham         University and President of the Irish American Historical Society.
Another very positive reaction came from Gerry Murphy, the New         York based director of Enterprise Ireland' (email 31 October 2011).
