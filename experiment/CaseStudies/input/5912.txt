     Fisheries policy has implications for ecology, conservation, food       security, and major consumer       markets (&#8364;55Billion p.a.
in the EU).
The results of [4], underpinned by       [1] and [2], show that a       balanced harvest policy offers the prospect of simultaneously increasing       yield while conserving the       structure of marine ecosystems and their resilience.
They have influenced       the policy of       international NGOs with global reach and stimulated and informed thinking       and policy debate in the       EU Parliament and elsewhere, e.g., in pursuit of long-term reform of the       Common Fisheries Policy       and the delivery of the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy.
The York research has been adopted by members of the Fisheries Expert       Group (FEG) of the       International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the European         Bureau for Conservation         and Development (EBCD).
The FEG is an influential group of       international leaders in fisheries       science, including Law's co-author Kolding, and chaired by Dr       Serge Garcia, ex-Director of the       Fisheries Management Division of the United Nations Food and         Agriculture Organization (FAO).
Law was an invited speaker at a FEG workshop in Nagoya (2010),       presenting his work with Datta,         Delius and Plank [6].
Law's was one of the three theoretical       talks at the workshop, which aimed to       "derive the practical consequences of the emerging science, to raise       decision makers' and       scientists' awareness [and] eventually, deliver relevant general       management advice".
The       associated workshop report [7] is a potentially paradigm-changing       contribution to global thinking on       sustainable fisheries policy that puts the case for a balanced harvest       approach in contrast to       traditional selective fishing.
The consequent Science Policy Forum       paper [8], of which Law and       Kolding are co-authors, makes specific proposals for fisheries management,       endorsed by the IUCN       in a press release: "The new approach proposed by IUCN, called `balanced       harvesting', involves       targeting all edible components of the marine environment, in proportion       to their productivity."
[10]     The main report and the Policy Forum paper have received considerable       interest (over 40 news       stories/press releases worldwide [11]).
Policy debate on fisheries       management has been informed       and stimulated at a high level among policy makers:            Garcia addressed the ALDE (Liberal/Democrats) group of MEPs at a         seminar introduced by EU         Fisheries Commissioner Damanaki [12], and the Committee on Fisheries         (COFI) of the UN         FAO at their meeting 9-13 July 2012 [COFI is influential over the         direction of FAO work].
Kolding made invited presentations on Balanced Harvest to the European         Fisheries Advisors         (May 2012, Oslo), and the Nordic Council of Ministers meeting 23-24         October 2012.
Law presented his joint work with Plank and Kolding at the 6th         World Fisheries Congress, a         major conference that "draws leading international figures influential         in driving debate and         shaping global policy on fishing" [9].
Law, Garcia and Kolding were the main speakers at a workshop on         balanced harvest [13] at         the European Parliament involving the Director of Policy Development and         Coordination, EU         Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (8 November         2012).
Law focussed on         the implications of [4] for balanced harvesting, building on [1, 2].
The success of these efforts can be gauged from a press release by Struan       Stevenson MEP, the       workshop Chair and Senior Vice President of the European Parliament       Fisheries Committee.
Entitled Scots Euro MP showcases revolutionary new management system         for fisheries,       Stevenson's press release quotes him as saying "Balanced Harvest is a       hugely exciting       development for fisheries sustainability...
...If balanced harvesting was       introduced in the North       Sea, it would help end the constant battle between fishermen who use a       wide variety of fishing       gears and target a broad spectrum of species and sizes, and managers in       Brussels, Westminster       and Holyrood who try to impose size limitations and gear regulations.
It       may be the answer to       achieving the 'Holy Grail' of fishing above Maximum Sustainable Yield       (MSY), so that fish stocks       are able readily to replenish themselves and catches and profits rise       accordingly" [13].
Furthermore, balanced harvest ideas are incorporated into the vision       document for Norwegian       Fisheries in 2050 [14], which, citing [8], envisions that a much increased       part of the ecosystem will       be considered in determining quotas and management.
Further evidence of the influence of balanced harvesting comes from the       recent ALTER-Net       Conference on the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy, where balanced harvest       appears in the       preparatory statements to stimulate debate [15].
A discussion of balanced       harvesting has been       initiated in India by V. Vivekanandan, former Chief Executive of the South       Indian Federation of       Fishermen Societies [the largest NGO for small scale fishermen in India],       and currently a       consultant to the FAO, who wrote to a group of other Indian fisheries       experts saying: "This is quite       revolutionary and the "selective fishing" vs. "balanced harvesting" debate       could very well turn out to       be the fisheries sector equivalent of the "flat earth" vs. "round earth"       debate in astronomy and       Newtonian principles vs. Relativity theory in physics" [16].
Fisheries policy is intensely political; decisions are influenced not       only by science but by many       other powerful lobbies.
However, in a relatively short time, Balanced       Harvest has been established       as a radical new approach on the policy scene, because it is       well-supported by the models.
Kolding writes: "Balanced Harvest would never have had the impact it now       has without model       work.
Firstly, because there are practicably no empirical observations to       study &#8212; and even if there       were, we could write volumes without getting anywhere... ...[Balanced       Harvest] has entered the       world `stage' with rocket speed AFTER the models started to look into it"       [17].
In summary: not only       did the pioneering work of Datta, Delius and Law find its       impact through the Balanced Harvest       community; the Balanced Harvest paradigm itself owes its impact to their       work.
