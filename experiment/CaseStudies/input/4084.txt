     Reading's research findings were presented to Defra, Natural England,       National Farmers Union, Home Grown Cereal Authority and farmers through a       combination of scientific publications, project reports, presentations and       discussion meetings.
Influencing management options in AES     The Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) scheme and associated guidance       handbook, was rolled out in 2005, with updated versions of the handbook       published in 2008, 2010 and 2013.
The Reading research was "immediately         picked up in the scheme design and rolled-out as an option" [a].
The       research, which identified the "crucial importance of the need to         manage margins (e.g.
through a summer cut of the outer 3m of 6m margins)         has been carried through into scheme design/delivery" [a].
The       findings from the PEBIL project [4-6] "was a valuable basis for the         development of EK1" [b], which takes field corners out of management       and requires that no fertilisers be applied and reduced cutting take place       to promote the growth of plants that provide large scale architectural       diversity.
"It was also part of the evidence base underpinning EE4,         EE5 and EE6 buffer strip options" [b] on intensive grasslands.
SAFFIE data also "contributed to the body of evidence that has led to         greater incentivisation for floristic supplementation of buffers in ELS"       [c].
"Formerly there were no additional points for sowing flower-rich         rather than cheaper grass-only seed mixes, with the cost of the more         expensive flower-rich mixes only met in HLS agreements" [c].
An independent report commissioned by Defra [d] presented SAFFIE, and the       Reading research within it, as an example of a "successful project"       and stated "the research was evaluated as having Medium scientific and         commercial impact with High environmental impact.
This project has been         well communicated and disseminated through a range of channels.
There is         evidence of uptake and dissemination through NGO partners such as [the         Royal Society for the Protection of Birds] and BTO.This is an example of         a multi-stakeholder project that has delivered positive results and,         specifically, some new options for the Entry Level Environmental         Stewardship (ELS) scheme" [d].
Supporting guidance and advocacy work of NGOs       The research conducted by Reading has been incorporated into the guidance       and advocacy work of numerous non-government organisations, supporting       their conservation programmes.
The Royal Society for the Protection of       Birds (RSPB) provides advice for farmers on maintaining field margins on       grasslands [e] and arable land.
Results of SAFFIE "have been used         extensively to inform practical implementation of measures (on RSPB         landholdings and advisory guidelines to other land managers) and in         policy advocacy" [c].
Butterfly Conservation also provides advice       around supporting butterfly diversity in farmland that recognises the       importance of maintaining flower-rich margins [f].
Influencing projects that bring environmental and economic benefits       The management options under AES and guidance provided by various NGOs in       relation to field margins has been influenced by the research conducted at       Reading.
These projects have in turn led to considerable environmental       benefits.
Between 2005 and 2009 in England, there were 21,463 agreements       set up containing field margin options that incorporated Reading's       research.
In 2009 alone there were 1,977 agreements for option EF4 (Nectar       Flower mixture) with a total area of 2,002ha.
By 2013 the number of       agreements had increased by 38% to 2,728 with an area of 3,618ha (59%       increase).
This equates to 34,736 ha of farmland that has undergone       changes mandated by the scheme and outlined in the ELS handbooks,       improving habitat for declining species including kestrels and severely       declining species like UK tree sparrows [g].
While the exact economic       benefit of improved biodiversity is difficult to estimate, a survey       conducted in 2010 [g] estimated the benefit of AES in England to be       between &#163;0.8 billion and &#163;1.5 billion per year based on citizens'       willingness to pay.
Helping the UK government meet national and international           biodiversity commitments     In 2008, the Joint Nature Conservancy Committee revised the cereal field       margin priority habitat under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan       (BAP) to broaden the scope to arable field margins [h].
These priority       habitats were identified as the most threatened and requiring conservation       action under the UK BAP and are now used under the UK Post-2010         Biodiversity Framework to help set conservation priorities at the       country level.
At an international level, the management of field margins is driven by       numerous international policies and directives, including the Nitrates       Directive, the Water Framework Directive and Environmental Stewardship.
Therefore, well-evidenced management strategies for field margins help       support UK government implementation of these directives [i].
The UK       government uses AES options, such as field margins, as a contribution to       its commitments to the European Union and Convention on Biological       Diversity.
