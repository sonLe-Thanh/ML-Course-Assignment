     Wheat is the most important arable crop grown in the UK, with nearly 2       million hectares under cultivation each year.
The value of the wheat       harvest to the UK economy is over &#163;1.6 billion.
Successful plant breeding       and improved crop management has increased the average yield of wheat in       the UK from c. 2 tonnes ha-1 in 1940s to 8 tonnes ha-1 in       2012.
However, this has resulted in crops being more `top heavy' and       susceptible to lodging (when the plant falls over either due to anchorage       failure, or the stem breaking).
Plants that are initially resistant to       lodging may stand erect during favourable conditions but may fall down       when exceptionally bad weather, such as heavy rain or wind prevails, or in       wet ground.
Plant growth regulators are used routinely to shorten the stem       of wheat, which reduces lodging risk but does not eliminate it.
The results of the first UoN seed rate project [a] identified the       optimum plant population for winter wheat and demonstrated a strong       relationship with sowing date (the later the sowing, the higher the       optimum plant population).
This has been adopted by growers, leading to a       saving in input costs (seed) particularly for early sowings.
The outcome       of the research on optimum plant population was first published by the       Home Grown Cereals Authority (HGCA) in 2000, with revised recommendations       for growers regarding optimum plant populations.
Continued work from UoN       informed the release of further guidelines within HGCA's Wheat Growth       Guide, published in 2008.
(Source 1).
In the new guide, target       plant populations for crops sown on given dates are provided and growers       are advised to only consider re-drilling wheat if fewer than 30 plants       ha-1 are established.
Prior to this project, most growers sowed a `weight'       of seed &#8212; e.g.
180kg ha-1, but UoN demonstrated that, as seed       weight can vary two fold, the same weight of seed could mean twice as many       seeds in one year as the next.
Now the majority of growers calculate their       `seed rate' in terms of number of seeds, rather than weight.
HGCA provide       a seed rate calculator on their website to help growers with this       calculation (Source 2).
The benefit to growers is through savings       in input cost and avoiding excessively large crops which are prone to       lodging (and hence have lower yields).
It is impossible to quantify the       number of farms that make use of the research findings relating to optimum       plant populations, but for those that do, the financial savings would be       significant.
Using figures from the Farm Business Survey (2010/11) it is       calculated that if a grower was previously sowing 180 kg ha-1,       at &#163;400 t-1, this would cost &#163;72 ha-1.
Moving to a       calculated seed rate of 150 seeds m-2 would cost &#163;27 ha-1,       at a thousand seed weight of 45g; a saving of &#163;45 ha-1.
Exact       savings will be farm-specific as they depend on baseline seed rates and       the adopted seed strategy.
Approximately 2 million hectares of wheat is       grown in the UK, so even if these changes were adopted on only 10% of the       area, this would equate to a saving of &#163;9 million per year to the       industry.
In a statement (2013), a farmer from Loughborough reported, 'Following         Nottingham/ADAS research on seed rates, we have reduced our winter wheat         seed rates.
Back in the late 90's our standard seed rate would have been         400 seeds per square metre, but now we start to sow around 10th         September at 225 seeds per square metre and then increase throughout the         sowing period to allow for poorer establishment.
Decisions are taken on         a field by field basis.
As on most local farms, our soil type is         variable within fields so we aim to vary seed rate according to soil         type within a field.
We estimate that reducing seed rates in this way         leads to savings of &#163;28 per hectare for our business at current seed         prices" (Source 3).
The lower plant populations are being actively used and winter wheat       crops are less likely to lodge, leading to greater returns for the grower.
The lodging model developed by Nottingham, led to greater understanding of       how growers can influence lodging risk through crop management and to new       guidelines for growers.
These have since been updated and are actively       used by growers (Source 1).
The lodging guidelines refer to a       number of HGCA project reports co-authored by Nottingham (Source 1).
An agronomist from Hurren Agronomy Limited stated (2013) that 'The         Nottingham/ADAS work on canopy management and lodging has provided         greater understanding of how sowing date, seed rate and nitrogen         availability affect lodging risk within the wheat" (Source 4).
BASIS is an independent organisation set up to establish and assess       standards in the pesticide industry relating to storage, transport and       competence of staff.
The BASIS Certificate in Crop Protection is the       `Certificate to Practice' for agronomists making pesticide recommendations       on farm.
The lodging guidelines are also studied by those whilst working       towards the BASIS Certificate in Crop Protection, which is an essential       award for anyone giving advice to growers on crop management practices.
The impact of the research found in the HGCA guidelines document was       summarised by a BASIS trainer who stated, 'The HGCA document (2008)       is a publication I find very useful, both on the BASIS Certificate in         Crop Protection and Advanced BASIS Cereals courses.
It helps to increase         students' understanding of the causes of lodging, integrated lodging         control, lodging risk assessment and the role of plant growth regulators"       (Source 5).
Since UoN began this programme of research and dissemination to farmers       the frequency of severe lodging events has reduced.
This is due to       improved understanding of the factors affecting lodging elucidated by this       research and the guidelines available on how to reduce the incidence of       lodging.
For example, avoiding early applications of nitrogen fertiliser       to maximise stem strength and reducing plant population to increase       anchorage strength.
This has resulted in significant savings through       avoiding losses of yield and quality caused by lodging (especially in       light of increased wheat price and drying costs).
Through avoiding those       losses in yield and quality, food processors benefit by being able to       source high quality grain that is suitable for their products and       consumers benefit from price stability.
In 2013, the Principal Research       Scientist at ADAS (the UK's leading expert on lodging) confirmed the       benefits of following the guidelines.
"Between 1980 and the early 2000s         the average frequency of severe lodging years in the UK was         approximately one in year in four.
Severe lodging years often coincided         with growing seasons with rapid autumn growth and wet summers.
The         2011/12 season was typified by a very mild autumn (hence rapid growth)         and the wettest summer for 100 years.
Despite the very favourable         conditions for lodging there was in fact only a moderate amount of         lodging in cereals during this season.
A large part of this good lodging         control is likely to be caused by good management of lodging risk         through the use of low seed rates, delaying N fertiliser to forward         crops and targeting robust PGR programmes to the crops with the greatest         lodging risk.
This better understanding about how to manage lodging risk         has been developed by research at the University of Nottingham, ADAS UK         Ltd and the University of Birmingham' (Source 6).
The reach of the UoN research into lodging is currently being extended       internationally.
Uptake of the Nottingham work by Australia's national       science agency, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research       Organisation (CSIRO) has been informing research direction and assisting       in grower extension activities.
The Grains Research and Development       Corporation (GRDC) is a statutory corporation reporting to the Australian       Government Department for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.
GDRC       delivers improvements in production, sustainability and profitability       across the Australian grains industry.
A research agronomist who has been       leading GRDC funded projects since 2008 to improve the yield of irrigated       wheat in north-eastern Australia stated, "The work of Debbie Sparkes         and her colleagues at The University of Nottingham has been invaluable         in understanding the causes of lodging, and helping us to improve         agronomic methods to control lodging while achieving high yields.
A         grower recently used some of these improved techniques to achieve 8.2 t         ha-1, which we believe is a record wheat yield         for the State of Queensland" (Source 7, 2013).
