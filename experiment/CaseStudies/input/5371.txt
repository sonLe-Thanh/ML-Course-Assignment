     How to conserve and restore peatlands is already a major and       controversial issue for the relevant UK and devolved authorities, while       information about climate change impacts (on top of all the other       pressures) has previously been virtually non-existent.
Before the start of the "Climate Change Impacts on UK Upland         (peatland) Soils" project, many national and local agencies were       aware of the importance of peatlands to the UK carbon balance, water       supplies and biodiversity, and the tangible current threats to the       integrity of peatlands.
But there was very little awareness of the       potential for climate change to add to these threats.
The project changed       that situation radically (see source [A]).
Information about potential       climate change impacts on UK upland peatlands is now well known to the       relevant stakeholders as a direct result of this project.
The relevant       transfer of knowledge began via knowledge exchange meetings held in 2009,       and continues today.
The specific benefits of the research include: knowledge of where       peatlands are not threatened by climate change; and knowledge of where       conservation measures are most important to preserve the integrity of       peatlands, both nationally [1, 2, 3] and worldwide [4].
There has been       impact through various public bodies including the following detailed       below.
The peatlands climate change project produced a policy briefing [A],       which covered biodiversity, water, greenhouse gas emissions and land       management aspects.
For each of these, it summarised the likely effects of       climate change and recommended actions to mitigate the changes.
DEFRA       used this briefing in its UK Climate Change Risk Assessment,       "Climate Change Risk Assessment for the Biodiversity and Ecosystem       Services sector" [B].
This report presents research completed as part of       the "UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) for a selected group of         risks in the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services sector" [B].
Paper       [2] is cited several times and forms the principal evidence base for the       assessment of climate change impacts on blanket bogs.
The IUCN conducted a `Commission of Inquiry on Peatlands'       which was published in Oct 2011 [C, D].
The report represented the "culmination         of 18 months of focused collaboration between peatland experts from land         management, science and policy from across the UK, and revealed the         enormous importance of peatlands for people and wildlife" [D].
The       Inquiry "identified a clear strategy for action to bring peatlands back         from the brink, and point[ed] the way forward to avoid the social and         environmental costs of further deterioration" [D].
The assessment       focused on blanket bog and raised bog peatlands which represent over 95%       of all UK peatland habitat and which offer an opportunity to make early       and substantial progress in delivering a combination of economic, social       and biodiversity gains.
The inquiry cited [2], as well as other related       Imperial College publications by Clark (DOIs: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.02.046,       10.3354/cr00923, 10.3354/cr00982),       concluding that the UK needs a policy to conserve peatland carbon stores       [C, D].
In June 2012 an international conference, `Investing in Peatlands -       Demonstrating Success', was held at Bangor University which included a       broad cross-section of academics and stakeholders concerned with peatlands       [E].
The conference was sponsored jointly by the British Ecological       Society and the IUCN's UK Peatland Programme.
It coincided with the       release of a report, `Opportunities for UK Business that Value and/or         Protect Nature's Services', which was commissioned for the Ecosystem         Markets Task Force by the Valuing Nature Network and was       financed by Defra and NERC [F].
The report outlined the business case for       valuing and protecting nature's services and highlighted a series of       drivers that are leading businesses to increasingly consider and manage       impacts on ecosystems and to look for business opportunities while they do       so.
The report ranked a carbon funding proposal for peatlands as the UK's       top ranked business opportunity from the natural environment [F].
Forest Research, the research agency of the Forestry         Commission published `A Strategic Assessment of the Afforested Peat       Resource in Wales' in October 2012 [G].
The report assessed the       distribution of the Welsh peatlands and provided an overview of the likely       factors impacting peat formation and afforested peat restoration, and       management of the biodiversity, hydrology and greenhouse gas benefits.
Papers [1] and [2] are cited in the report numerous times in relation to       the climate change impacts on peat distribution and the viability of sites       for restoration ([G], sections 4 and 5.2.6).
The work [2, 3] has been cited in a briefing report by the Scottish         Parliament, intended as background to policy making for peatlands       [H].
The following is an excerpt from this Scottish Parliament report (`Box         5 The effect of climate change on Scottish peatlands', p22), where       the references cited are [3] and [2] respectively: "Peatlands are         vulnerable to climate change.
As temperatures increase, the areas         suitable for peatlands in Scotland could reduce with the south and east         of their range likely to be under greatest stress [3].
High water         tables in peatlands are maintained by high rates of precipitation and         low evapotranspiration.
Peatlands are particularly sensitive to changing         weather patterns for the following reasons:     - Higher temperatures lead to drying out of peat, falling water         table, cracking and erosion     - Increased likelihood of wildfire, leading to significant vegetation         loss     - More heavy rainfall events are likely to cause more erosion on         damaged peatlands However, specific changes to particular peatlands are         very difficult to predict.
Climate model predictions apply over large         regions and their implications are often difficult to interpret at small         scales.
Warming is expected to have the most significant effect on         peatlands that are already degraded and under pressure - pristine bogs         may be more resilient to small changes in temperature [2]" [H].
The project has generated favourable commentary and further requests for       access to the model outputs by stakeholders including Forest Research, the       James Hutton Institute, the Peatscapes project in the North Pennines and       Scottish Natural Heritage.
Some examples (extracted from e-mails to Jo       House) are:     From Judith Stuart, Soils Policy Team, DEFRA:     "I thought the [Climate Research] special issue was very useful.
....         there are so many interesting and relevant papers.....
I have been         weaving the information into policy work on peat.
So if influencing         policy is a measure of success ..."     From Iain Brown, James Hutton Institute, lead author of the UK       Climate Change Risk Assessment for the biodiversity and ecosystem services       sector:     "Do you think it would be possible for us to use the information,         particularly the headline bioclimate map, in the UK Climate Change Risk         Assessment, appropriately referenced of course?
In the Biodiversity         &amp; ESS sector I asked them to look at Blanket Bog as a key habitat         under risk from climate change (we also have changes in soil organic         carbon as another related risk).
However the analysis on this currently         in the CCRA is somewhat lacking and I disagree with its findings.
Based         upon work we have done previously...your method and findings are much         more robust."
Continuing impacts are expected on two fronts: (a) ongoing policy shifts       at the level of the UK and devolved administrations, recognizing the       implications of climate change for policies concerning upland peatlands:       and (b) increasing global recognition (by IUCN and other bodies) of the       unique nature of the blanket bog biome, the potential restriction in its       area due to climate change, and the importance of identifying and taking       steps to conserve "refugial" areas of this biome.
