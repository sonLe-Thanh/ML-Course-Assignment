     The exhibition, `India &#8212; Past, Present and Abroad' was mounted at       Macquarie University Art Gallery; 24 January &#8212; 4 March 2011, and curated       by Jane Chapman, Rhonda Davis and Leonard Janiszewski.
Members of the       public were invited to the opening of the exhibition and the Gallery's       evaluation of the 4 week exhibition is as follows:     The attendance figures:            Opening: 200       Public Programs: 150       Overall visitation 2000          Extracts from the visitors book include: `powerful'; `stimulating';       `brilliant exhibition'; `excellent and inspiring'; `extensive'; `thought       provoking and innovative'.
The exhibition also attracted feedback from:            Senior Curator, Macquarie University Art Gallery       Indian Consul, Amit Das Gupta       Indian media in Australia       Representatives of community groups and the general public          Indian visitors to the exhibition learned about their own history and       roots in their mother country at a time when India's identity as an       independent nation was being articulated.
Rhonda Davis, Senior Curator, Macquarie University Art Gallery reported       in her feedback on `A highly successful exhibition in terms of visitor         engagement, enquiry and responses, engaging the public into a positive         reaffirmation and perception of Indian identity and culture as a means         of encouraging local understanding of Australia as a tolerant society.
Jane delivered an informative and engaging talk that prompted discourse         and dialogue.
A Q &amp; A session sparked many questions and comments         creating space for an open-ended dialogue to occur.
It was interesting         to witness this level of engagement and I believe this was largely due         to the quality of the research undertaken' (Rhonda Davis 31.10.12).
Ms Davis commented on how the exhibition illuminated the ways in which       disempowered women tried to get coverage of their campaigning by using       newspapers as a vehicle for communication.
This revealed a hidden aspect       of history, but also suggested new methodological approaches to analysis       of the press:     `The way of working with newspapers that enquires into their effect         and the way they were used by disempowered people was also new to         audiences, who were able to better appreciate historical method for         `hidden' history from below' (Davis op cit).
The Guest Speaker at the opening event was the then Indian Consul, Amit       Das Gupta, who spoke about the research indicating its significance to       contemporary issues of identity and belonging.
He said `The spate of         attacks on Indian students and members of the Indian community in         Australia in 2009-10 triggered outrage in Australia, India and among the         global community.
Institutions of higher education emerged as the ideal         platform to nourish this dialogue and to trigger a debate.
The Indian         community has sought to not only draw on its 'Indianness' but also to         embrace its new- found identity.
The unique exhibition 'India: Past,       Present and Abroad' explores precisely this theme, and the talk by Jane         Chapman drew the audience into looking at the role the media played in         India's struggle for freedom from British colonial occupation.
Discovering identity or even revisiting ones roots is not an easy         process.
Such projects can only help build the foundations for a         discovery by a continent of a sub continent and by a subcontinent of a         continent (Amit Das Gupta (29.10.12).
Non-Indian Australian visitors were introduced to aspects of Indian       culture and history, knowledge of which is overshadowed by larger and       longer standing immigrant communities such as those from China.
A member       of the general public said: I was first drawn to the lecture because         at that time, a number of distressing issues had occurred against         immigrants from India in both Sydney and Melbourne.
...Little did I know         India is a Nation of plurality, or sub-cultures within culture.
Jane         Chapman's work, helped dispel many of these initial thoughts or         misconceptions that I had developed in my early life.
The public lecture         unearthed several confronting issues from a humanist perspective and the         frailty of the human condition.
In some ways the aftermath when cultures         collide formed the symbolism I found by attending this public lecture,         delivered a form of serendipity I least expected.
This exhibition in         many ways captured the essence of the numerous moments in time, in an         artful way.
The lecture altered my way of thinking and knowledge about         India.
I left the lecture and exhibition charged with the thought that         unearthing and presenting these hidden histories are important'       (Michael Bolton, 30.10.2012).
The event also attracted attention from Indian media in Australia, as       follows: Following his attendance at the opening of the exhibition,       Chandra Devudu, Executive Producer,of the Kannada Language Program for SBS       Radio conducted an interview with Jane Chapman for his weekly network       programme aimed at the Kannada Indian community in Australia.
He said: `It         was educating and illuminating.
Hope we will meet again to discuss about         Indian history, again.'
(Chandra Devudu, 23.2.11)     In addition, two feature articles were published in India Link,       the weekly magazine for Indian immigrants in Australia.
The Editor,       Shivangi Ambani, noted; `It's great to know the exhibition is getting         such a good response'.
Shivangi Ambani, Editor, Indian Link       (8 Feb. 2011);'     The exhibition also provoked suggestions from community leaders for       future involvement with Indian artists in Australia: Great exhibition         and audience development.
You might like to invite Barry Keldoulis as he         represents some Indian artists and he might like to network at that         level'(Edwina Marks, Manager Community Services, City of Wagga       Wagga, NSW, 27 January 2011).
In addition to the impact noted above, the Senior Curator of the       Macquarie University Art Gallery noted how working with Jane Chapman had       introduced her to new methods of presentation: From a curatorial         perspective, having the opportunity to work with Professor Jane Chapman         on the exhibition introduced new methodologies and ways of thinking in         contextualising the material to make those connections between the         visual frameworks and text analysis.
Working within an interdisciplinary         curatorial team affords a unique transition between the research and         images in creating entry points for visitors to engage at a much deeper         level' (Rhonda Davis, op.cit.
