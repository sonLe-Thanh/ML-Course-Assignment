     Prior to the publication of the Cardiff University trial, worldwide       policy and practice included routine debrief following traumatic events.
This recommendation and practice has been changed worldwide as a result of       Cardiff University research.5.1-5.10 Despite being difficult to       quantify, the public, patients and healthcare institutes will also have       benefited as a result of better treatment management and a reduction in       associated costs of health and social care and loss to the economy.
Linking Cardiff's underpinning research to REF period impact       Recognised for the findings from his underpinning research, Bisson was       asked to co-chair the NICE Guideline Development Group.
Cardiff research       and expertise played a major role in the evidence base used to assess the       efficacy of PD and contributed significantly to the widely cited Cochrane3.4         and NICE5.8 reviews.
For example, in its clinical       summary leading to recommendation against the provision of systematic,       brief, single session interventions after traumatic events (p.84), the       NICE guideline5.8 specifically cites Bisson et al.
(1997)3.1         as providing evidence of harmful effects.
Since publication,       extensive citation of these reviews has led to the global dissemination of       the key message not to provide PD following traumatic events.
Qualifying global dissemination and impact on public policy       Since 2008, underpinning findings published in either the Cochrane review       or NICE guidelines have impacted upon the following policy documents:            In the UK, the Department of Health's NHS Emergency planning Guidance         (DoH, 2009) recommends against the provision of single session         interventions that focus on people's emotional reactions (p. 93),         stating that this risks re-traumatisation.
In Europe, a European Union funded project, The European Network for         Traumatic Stress (TENTS, 2008) created guidelines5.3 that         recommend against formal interventions such as single session individual         PD (p. 5).
The guidelines are now being implemented through a Train           the Trainer programme across Europe with 35 participating         countries (www.tentsproject.eu);         31 workshops and 462 potential new trainers have been trained.
In the USA, the Departments of Veterans' Affairs and Defense 2010         guideline5.2 states that, "Routine debriefing or formal           psychotherapy is not beneficial for asymptomatic individuals and may           be harmful" (p. 26).
Bisson et al.
(1997)3.1 is cited         (along with Mayou et al., 2000) on page 105 as one of "two           well-controlled studies with longer-term follow-up of individual           patients [that] have suggested that this intervention may be related           to a poorer outcome compared to controls".
The Australian guidelines (ACPMH, 2013)5.1 updated the         systematic reviews used for NICE and an earlier version of the         Australian guidelines (ACPMH, 2007) and recommend "For adults           exposed to a potentially traumatic event, a one-session, structured,           psychological intervention in the acute phase, such as psychological           debriefing, should not be offered on a routine basis" (p. 3 of Full           Guidelines).
The International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (ISTSS, 2008)         produced treatment guidelines5.4 recommending that individual         PD should not be used following traumatic events (p. 2).
The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's (NATO's) Joint Medical         Committee produced non- binding guidance5.9 for its members         and partner nations in 2008 (NATO, 2008).
The document concludes that it         is "not advisable to provide a single session intervention that           focuses on people's emotional reactions" (p. 93).
The Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) comprises a large number of         UN and non-UN humanitarian organisations working together to strengthen         coordination of humanitarian assistance (www.humanitarianinfo.org/iasc).
IASC has produced a series of documents that are widely followed         throughout the world.
Based on its own guidelines (IASC, 2007)5.6,         IASC produced a document5.7 in 2010 to provide an overview of         "essential knowledge that humanitarian health actors should have           about mental health and psychosocial support in humanitarian           emergencies".
On page 11 it states that PD is "...at best           ineffective and should not be implemented".
The Sphere Project (www.sphereproject.org)         comprises a group of NGOs and the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.
It has produced a widely followed handbook5.10 that details         universal minimum standards in core areas of humanitarian response.
The         latest Sphere handbook (2011) states that, "Psychological debriefing           is ineffective and should not be provided" (p. 73).
The IASC and Sphere documents have both been translated into numerous       languages and are available to download from the respective websites.
Bisson's original research3.1 and the impact it has had was       included in the submission of Cardiff University's Violence Research       Group, which was independently audited before winning a 2009 Queen's       Anniversary Prize.
Patient impact     According to www.healmyptsd.com, 70% of     adults (223.4 million people) in the U.S. alone experience some type of     traumatic event at least once in their lives and, of those victims, 60- 80%     will develop PTSD.
Additionally, people with PTSD have among the highest     rates of healthcare service use, resulting in significant costs to society.
These figures therefore suggest that during the REF assessment period     (2008-2013), the widespread dissemination of the research finding and strong     recommendations against the use of PD in the major international guidelines     must have benefited many tens of thousands of patients and hundreds of     healthcare institutes around the world.
