     Over the past 15 years, the respiratory physiology team at ICH has played       a major role, both nationally and internationally, in the development,       validation and standardisation of methods of assessing respiratory       function in infants and preschool children.
As a result, standardised       equipment, software and guidelines for infant and paediatric lung function       tests are in widespread use around the world.
Impacts on development of equipment     In 2000 [ref 2], we published recommendations on equipment for assessing       infant lung function.
Accordingly, such equipment has been developed in       line with our recommendations, and is now commercially available and in       use world-wide.
For example, we worked with CareFusion on their BabyBody       device &#8212; they report on this collaboration as follows: "The current 5th       generation, Jaeger MasterScreen BabyBody, resulted from collaborative       efforts of the Jaeger R&amp;D and the Portex Respiratory Unit teams.
This collaboration ensured that the MasterScreen BabyBody was       cross-validated against existing, previously validated instruments, so       that compliance could be achieved with the ATS/ERS guidelines  	  [ref 2] which represent the current standards of paediatric health       professionals in this field".
This device has been sold around the       world [a].
Similarly, since publication of our research showing       that the lung clearance index is a far more sensitive measure of early       lung disease than standard spirometry [refs 3 &amp; 4], commercially       available multiple gas washout devices such as the ndd EasyOne ProLAB have       been developed, to enhance widespread international clinical usage [b].
All-age reference equations for lung function     During the past five years, we have published all-age reference equations       to improve accurate diagnosis of lung disease [refs 5 &amp; 6], which have       rapidly led to changes in practice (see below) and commercial equipment       around the world.
We made the GLI-2012 equations available through the       resource website (www.lungfunction.org)       which had 7,488 unique visitors in the first six months of 2013, with over       500 hits each from the USA, Canada, Japan, Germany and the Netherlands.
The GLI-2012 equations have been endorsed by all major international       respiratory societies including the European Respiratory Society, the       American Thoracic Society, the Australian and New Zealand Society of       Respiratory Science; the Asian Pacific Society for Respirology; the       Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand; and the American College of       Chest Physicians [c].
They have also been adopted by both national       and international professional clinical and public health organisations       such as the UK CF registry, the Health Survey for England [d] and       the US NIHR Sickle Cell Anaemia Sleep and Asthma Cohort (SAC) study [e].
These equations have also changed the way lung function is reported in       commercial equipment, due to our identification of appropriate       age-specific lower limits of normal for spirometric outcomes, rather than       dependence on fixed thresholds.
Morgan Scientific, a leading manufacturer       of pulmonary function instrumentation and software, reports that: "As         soon as we heard about the GLI initiative we eagerly accommodated the         equations, I believe we were the first manufacturer to do so.
As our         customer base is heavily centred in ...pediatric hospitals in the USA,         there has been keen interest in adopting the GLI set" [f].
Other manufacturers who have confirmed their use of our equations include:       CareFusion, Medical Graphics corporation, Cosmed, Ganshorn, Medikro,       Medisoft, Medset, MIR, Morgan, ndd Medical and nSpire [g].
Clinical benefits     One benefit of our all-age equations is that they overcome the serious       potential errors which can occur when a child is switched from paediatric       to adult equations at 18 years of age.
Previously, this could result in a       sudden apparent drop in lung function by as much as 25%, simply due to the       equations selected (Kirkby et al, Eur Resp J 2011:39;1256-7).
Our all-age       equations remove this sudden change, and as a result, are being adopted in       an increasing number of establishments to ensure a smooth transition       between paediatric and adult care.
In 2011, Janet Stocks was awarded a       Lifetime Achievement Award by the European Respiratory Society in       recognition that her work has "helped give paediatric medicine the         tools to better understand and treat the respiratory illnesses of         childhood" [h].
She has also recently been awarded the       British Paediatric Respiratory Society 2013 lifetime achievement award in       recognition of her `commitment in advancing the care of children with         respiratory disease in the UK' [i].
Change in clinical practice     Our work has been widely cited in Standard Operating Procedures for       measuring lung function, demonstrating the impact our work has had on       clinical practice [j].
Great Ormond Street Hospital report that: "the substantial clinical         impact that the work by Professor Janet Stocks and her team has made         ...[has occurred] not only at Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital,         but also in other respiratory units ...nationally and internationally...         During the past 5 years we have introduced routine lung function tests         for all clinically diagnosed infants with CF throughout infancy and the         preschool years to help guide management &#8212; whereas in the past objective         tests of lung function only commenced from 5-6 y upwards.
This has led         to the description of early changes in CF hitherto unidentified and an         upscaling of our management protocols... [With the] published findings         of Prof Stocks' group on early structural and functional changes...         patient directed escalation of therapy to halt early changes during         these crucial early years is introduced &#8212; with protocols that have been         adopted by other centres in the greater London region.
We are now         interpreting all clinical lung function results using the GLI 2012         equations, which has overcome problems previously faced when         interpreting results from children from Black and ethnic minorities and         when transitioning between paediatric and adult care.
This seminal work         finally makes sense of the longitudinal tracking of lung function in         children through childhood, adolescence and into adulthood....we are         also now routinely using MBW as a sensitive marker of early lung disease         in clinical practice.... Of considerable clinical significance is         Professor Stocks' detailed review of outcome measures for assessing lung         function... in newborn screened CF infants.
This important work led to         our clinical decision to limit CT scanning (with its inherent radiation         burden) to just those children who are showing unexplained clinical         decline and remove it from our routine surveillance programme with cost         benefits to the NHS and reduction in harm to patients [k].
In addition, Yale University report that: Our work would not have         been possible without the landmark publications by the research team at         the University College London (UCL)....
It is because of the outstanding         work of the UCL team that I am better positioned to evaluate and manage         respiratory symptoms in aging populations, both as a pulmonologist and         geriatrician" [l].
Training     Fully funded research fellows from around the world regularly apply to       undertake training in the specialised paediatric respiratory laboratories       at ICH, such that we now have collaborative satellite sites established in       Southampton, Munster, Lisbon, Barcelona, Montreal, Toronto and Australia       (Melbourne, Victoria; Perth, WA and Newcastle, NSW.
