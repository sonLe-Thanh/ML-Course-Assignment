Refugees: integration, self-confidence and mutual awareness         Hafan has `made a big difference to building self-confidence and a           sense of being welcomed, for those who have been published, and others           as well' (DPIA).
Many writers discovered and promoted by         Hafan go on to other projects: theatre performances, writing         competitions, workshops, exhibitions, festivals: marking sociocultural         integration.

The project         has wider impact as `a compassionate link among refugees and           political exiles with the Swansea and Welsh community, [...] a           necessary part of an equation to bring back our sense of humanity and           build a sense of hope.

Charities and public bodies: internal and external awareness           raising         The publications make `a very significant difference to the way           staff think about the experiences of refugees [and] enable our           trainers to transform understanding among professionals in health,           social services and education' (Chief Executive, Welsh Refugee           Council).
`The project is unique and incredibly valuable for           organisations such as ours, in making visible voices that are very           seldom heard' (WMP).
The books help train service         providers, win politicians' and donors' support, and make `a major           contribution to informing the public in Wales about asylum seekers and           refugees' (DPIA).
Local media coverage of launch events has         helped alter perceptions of asylum seekers from `scroungers' or victims         to `people of remarkable talent, imagination and creative energy'         (DPIA).

`The           Museum's experience of working with Hafan Books [on the 2010-13         `Belonging' gallery] has fed into current plans for redevelopment           [...] to reflect more of the diversity in Wales today, and allow more           people to participate' (Keeper, St Fagans National History           Museum; 500,000 visitors p.a.)
