             Professor Oswald's research has had impacts on both public policy               and on public understanding, both in the UK and abroad.
Oswald's public policy impact was reflected in the Office of               National Statistics' (ONS) 2010 launch of the Measuring National               Well-being Programme.
Oswald was active in this initiative,               presenting to ONS staff and serving on the ONS National Well-being               Advisory Forum.
Lord Gus O'Donnell, UK Cabinet Secretary from               2005-2011, reflected, "Oswald's research into happiness helped               show that serious and important policy conclusions flowed from               understanding the level and determinants of people's subjective               well-being.
It helped me directly in arguing the case for getting               the ONS to start measuring well-being.
Now that we have leaders               from David Cameron to Ben Bernanke arguing that well-being is the               ultimate goal of policy, it is clear that the pioneers like Andrew               have been very effective in getting across the implications of               their research" (O'Donnell (2013)).
Ewen McKinnon, from the Analysis and Insights team at the Cabinet               Office, stated "I work on national well-being policy across               government... We very much value [Oswald's] work, ... particularly               his approach analysing well-being against bio-markers..., his               academic leadership in this area, and the way he translates this               for policy makers" (McKinnon (2013)) .
Stephen Aldridge, Director               for Analysis and Innovation in the Department of Communities and               Local Government (DCLG), added "Professor Oswald's work has been               crucial ... in explaining the key drivers of happiness and               well-being, both in general and for particular groups, such as the               elderly, in both the UK and other countries" (Aldridge (2013)).
Internationally, an early and prominent effort to better measure               social welfare was the Stiglitz Commission on the Measurement of               Social and Economic Progress (Stiglitz, Sen, Fitoussi (2009), or               SSF), initiated by President Nicholas Sarkozy.
Oswald was a member               of the Commission, which concluded that both objective and               subjective measures of well-being are important and should be               analysed.
Oswald's journal articles are referenced as early,               fundamental research throughout the Stiglitz Commission report.
Dr Marco Mira d'Ercole, OECD economist and rapporteur of the SSF               quality of life chapters, concluded, "The... SSF Commission proved               to be extremely influential in policy discussions, moving the               issue of measuring performance beyond GDP from academic circles to               the policy field....
There is today an established international               agenda on measuring performance beyond GDP that simply did not               exist in 2008.
Andrew played an important role in articulating the               implications of [his and other subjective well-being] research for               policy and statistical work" (Mira d'Ercole (2013)).
Dr Mira d'Ercole continued, "Beyond his role in the SSF               Commission, Andrew is today one of the most prominent researchers               using [subjective well-being] measures to value non-market               outcomes."
Oswald commented upon and is cited heavily in a number               of OECD publications on measuring well-being (OECD (2011), OECD               (2013)).
"It would not be an overstatement to say that Andrew's               work on valuing non-market outcomes is one of the most important               contributions to this area in the last decade or so...
It is also               an area that has received significant attention from the UK               Cabinet Strategy Office and other OECD government agencies" (Mira               d'Ercole (2013)).
The UN has joined the movement with a 2011 declaration, a 2012               High Level Meeting on "Happiness and Well Being: Defining a New               Economic Paradigm" at the United Nations headquarters in New York               (UN (2012)), and the first "World Happiness Report" (Helliwell,               Layard, and Sachs (2012)), a commissioned report published by the               Earth Institute at the University of Columbia.
Twelve of Oswald's               papers were cited in the report, including articles (3), (4), and               (5) above.
Second, Oswald's research has shaped public attitudes and               understanding about how to augment measures of social progress               beyond income to include individuals' happiness and self-reported               wellbeing.
Oswald's research has featured prominently and               extensively in economics and mainstream media.
The 2010 Christmas               edition of The Economist, which sells more than one million copies               worldwide, featured Oswald's well-being research on its cover (The               Economist (2010a), The Economist (2010b), reporting especially on               (5) above).
For many years his work has also been reported in the               New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, BBC's Today Programme and               BBC Television News, and in leading foreign language publications.
The newspaper database Factiva lists 1,047 newspaper articles in               over 100 outlets across five continents referencing Professor               Oswald's research on happiness and/or well-being (accessed 29 May,               2013), 478 since January 1, 2008 (Factiva (2012)).
Oswald's dissemination and advocacy of this research as well as               his willingness to engage with media helped to generate and later               sustain public interest in the impact of life events like               unemployment, age, or divorce on happiness and the appropriate               measure of social welfare Unlike much economic research, Oswald's               work is particularly salient to people's individual circumstances.
Millions have read, heard, or viewed media reports that allow them               to relate their own happiness and/or well-being to that               experienced by others like (or unlike) themselves.
Aldridge               (2013), agreed, "Oswald's research has been crucial in raising the               profile of the happiness and wellbeing agenda."
