     Leyshon and French's original research was published in the 2006 Treasury       Committee report Financial Inclusion: Credit, Savings, Advice and         Insurance and provided the evidence used by the Committee to       recommend that the Financial Inclusion Taskforce (FIT) "undertake a           mapping exercise to determine the problem of lack of access to           branches" (a, pp.
46-7).
The FIT commissioned Experian to       conduct a wide-ranging analysis of the provision of financial services in       the UK (b).
In view of Leyshon and French's research, Experian were       specifically requested to consider the geographies of financial exclusion.
The Experian reports analysed and mapped the supply of, and demand for,       affordable credit delivered by Credit Unions, Community Development       Financial Institutions and other, not-for-profit `third sector' providers       (c), as well as the supply of mainstream financial services (bank and       building society branches, ATMs, the Post Office), in relation to the       geography of financial exclusion (d).
Confirming Leyshon and French's conclusions, these reports identified       important geographical gaps in access to financial services and the supply       of affordable credit.
From a total of c. 450 local authority       areas, "25 `red alert' areas and a further 56 `amber' areas with           very high or high levels of under-served demand" for       affordable credit were specified (e, p. 19).
The 25 `red alert' areas were       Stoke-on-Trent, Corby, Lincoln, Wansbeck, Manchester, North Ayrshire,       Dundee City, Halton, Easington, Gateshead, Newcastle upon Tyne,       Chesterfield, Peterborough, Hartlepool, Blyth Valley, Inverclyde,       Chester-le-Street, Southampton, Ellesmere Port and Neston, Torfaen,       Carlisle, Derwentside, Wirral, Bolsover and South Tyneside (c, p. 19).
Acknowledging that banks and other mainstream financial institutions had       already withdrawn from low income communities in their pursuit of more       profitable customers, the Treasury published another report outlining how       affordable credit could be extended into the 25 `red alert' local       authority areas between 2008 and 2011 (e).
This recommended a more       geographically targeted provision of credit through the Growth Fund,       established by the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) in 2004 to       increase the availability of affordable personal loans via `third sector'       lenders, to support "the revenue and capital funding requirements of           existing high-performing Growth Fund lenders, as well as           providing capital to new lenders in [the 25] priority areas"       (e, p. 28).
A commitment was also secured from the major banks and the       Post Office to work with the Growth Fund team to support affordable,       not-for-profit credit and "to develop new provision in [the] 25         high priority areas identified by the Financial Inclusion Taskforce"       (e, p. 28), delivered in part by free use of back-office premises and       enhanced access to banking platforms.
The changed arrangements involved the establishment of new contracts with       `third sector' lenders to provide Growth Fund service in 16 of the 25 high       priority areas in the first half of 2008 and an open competition for other       not-for-profit agencies to extend this provision in 2009.
By March 2010,       56 of the 81 priority areas (25 red and 56 amber) had Growth Fund coverage       and a further 12 had plans to ensure some coverage (f, pp.
24-25).
It is       estimated that these targeted Growth Fund loans saved borrowers an average       of between &#163;377 and &#163;425 in interest payments (g).
As Jones (h, p. 2150)       recognises: "The material impact of this shift in policy was to make           Growth Fund loans accessible to the previously financially             excluded.
In Southwark, Leeds, South Tyneside, Newham and Hampshire             and in many other areas around the country, credit unions are             effectively utilising the Growth Fund to make a real difference in             providing affordable credit and accessible savings products for low             income consumers."
As a result of these changes, the mechanism through which the Growth         Fund was distributed to low income households by `third sector'         providers became better attuned to the geographical variations in credit         supply highlighted by Leyshon and French, significantly enhancing its         efficacy.
In their assessment of the Growth Fund's role, commissioned by         the Treasury, Collard et al.
argue that it provides a "level             of service to financially excluded communities [that] did not exist             prior to 2006" (g, p. 5).
By March 2011, 405,134 Growth Fund         loans had been distributed nationwide by 150 `third sector' lenders         serving 400 communities across the country.
Many of these loans were to         individuals who had never previously used the services of `third sector'         providers.
As Collard et al.
(g, p. 6) make clear: "Growth             fund lenders were... primarily serving a completely new market."
Borrowers were principally from poor and deprived communities.
Of those         surveyed by Collard et al., 79% were in the two lowest income         quintiles and 90% rented their homes, mainly from local authorities or         housing associations.
The majority of borrowers were women.
Phase Two of         the Growth Fund (2008-2011) has "expanded the loan book of             participating credit unions significantly and has enabled these             credit unions to reach out to many more people on low incomes"         (i, p. 28).
There is also a growing recognition, that low cost credit         that is generated locally has the additional impact of keeping money in         the community where it is spent and recycled in local businesses.
By challenging prevailing assumptions that bank and building society         branch closures were inevitable consequences of technological change,         Leyshon and French's research stimulated widespread interest.
Their         evidence was used by the Campaign for Community Banking Services (CCBS)         to support its message that branch closures were increasing financial         exclusion (j) and by the Building Societies Association to demonstrate         that building societies were providing better service than banks in         certain areas of the country.
By highlighting the growing geographical         discrepancies in access to financial services, Leyshon and French's         research influenced government policy and helped ensure that existing         schemes to increase access to affordable credit among low-income         communities could more effectively target locations of greatest need.
Poor and financially excluded individuals and households, so often the         victims of loan sharks and exploitative `grey market' providers that         focus on areas abandoned by banks and building societies, now have         better access to affordable credit.
In 2012, French and Leyshon, assisted by Meek (PhD student and Research         Assistant), updated the project to explore changes in branch provision         between 2003 and 2012.
This reveals that the continuing reduction in         bank and building society branch networks is concentrated to an even         greater extent in areas of economic and social deprivation, increasing         the geographical variability.
Political parties have taken notice,         reassessing their policies to address the processes of financial         exclusion.
The latest research findings were disseminated to policy         makers and financial services practitioners through a press release in         August 2013 that stimulated widespread media interest with national         coverage by the BBC (e.g.
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23759025)         and the Financial Times.
The research was formally endorsed by         the Community Investment Coalition.
The key beneficiaries of the research are UK policy-makers who are         better able to target resources geographically; Credit Unions, Community         Development Financial Institutions and other `third sector' providers         that have greater access to targeted monies from the `Growth Fund' and         have therefore expanded their delivery of affordable credit; and those         low-income individuals, families and communities that have received this         enhanced provision.
