     The de-nationalisation of its copper mines has powered economic growth in       Zambia over the last       decade [5.1].
The Economist ranks Zambia as one of the       world's fastest-growing economies over       this period and since 2000 average income per capita has risen more than       40 per cent.
Copper       accounts for 80 per cent of Zambia's export earnings, which were 9 billion       US dollars for 2011.
Research at Southampton that successfully challenged conventional wisdom       on the formation of       copper deposits in Zambia, is credited with playing a key role in       furthering the development of the       Central African Copperbelt.
Prior to studies led by Roberts, the Zambian       Copperbelt was regarded       as a mature exploration terrane, with limited opportunities for new ore       discoveries.
Southampton's       intervention was timely as the renascent mining industry in Zambia was       attracting substantial       incoming investment from the world's mining giants.
Insights published by       Roberts et al gave       mining companies the licence to be more creative in generating new targets       and allowed them to       manage risk more effectively.
On behalf of Anglo American, Graham Brown [5.2],       Group Head of       Geosciences, comments that research at Southampton "changed our         exploration targeting         methodologies and, by encouraging us to think about the process of         formation, opened up the         whole (copper) package, and made regions prospective that weren't         prospective previously."
The lessening of risk was crucial.
The new Southampton research model       gave several mining       companies, including Anglo American, Equinox/Barrick, First Quantum, Vale       and Rio Tinto, the       confidence to launch new exploration programs in the knowledge that viable       Cu-Co deposits       existed outside the regions explored under the traditional research       paradigm.
The published       research provided these companies with the geochemical tools and       theoretical modelling to find       them.
It has been impossible to obtain commercially confidential figures       detailing the amount of       investment global mining companies have poured into these programs.
In       2012 Rio Tinto used the       new Southampton model to shift its exploration focus to a relatively       unexplored area south of the       Domes region, committing a substantive exploration budget.
Adam Duffin [5.3],       Chief Geoscientist       at Rio Tinto, said: "Rio Tinto has invested considerable resources in         copper exploration in Zambia         over the past two years based on the new understanding of the geology of         the copperbelt and its         mineral resources and enjoys a strong relationship with The University         of Southampton group led         by Steve Roberts which it has drawn on in developing our exploration         strategy."
World-leading       exploration consultant Richard Sillitoe [5.4] notes: "The         University of Southampton group led by         Steve Roberts has played a key role in an ongoing reinterpretation of         the geology of the Zambian         Copperbelt.
This fresh vision is stimulating exploration activity in the         region, impacting on the         strategies that companies are employing and leading to increased         expenditure."
One of the most significant outcomes of this expanded exploration       activity in Zambia was the       opening, by Australian miners Equinox, of a new mine in Lumwana, in the       Domes region, in       January 2009, an asset that part motivated Barrick's takeover of Equinox       for &#163;4.5 billion in July       2011.
The population of Manyama, the nearest settlement to the mine has       increased five-fold over       the last ten years.
The opening of the mine has offered employment       (directly and indirectly) to       around 3000 Zambians in the region and improved local infrastructure [5.5].
Mike Richards [5.6],       former Chief Geologist at Barrick, said: "The decade-long collaboration         between Steve Roberts's         team and our geology team in Zambia to reinterpret the geology of the         Zambian Copperbelt has         been an integral part of our exploration efforts in Zambia.
It has had a         profound influence on our         exploration strategies, expenditure and success in the region."
The impact of the research has extended beyond Zambia.
Mining companies       have applied the       Southampton model to similar environments in Gabon and Democratic Republic       of Congo (DRC).
Canada's Ivanplats led the discovery of the Kamoa mine near Lubumbashi,       the mining capital of       DRC, in 2011.
DRC produces more than three per cent of the world's copper       and half its cobalt.
Kamoa ranks as the world's largest undeveloped high-grade copper       discovery, with 739 million       tonnes grading 2.67% copper.
In Gabon another Canadian firm Armada       Exploration is investing       more than $5 million in exploration for copper in a region with a similar       formation history to the       Zambian Copperbelt [5.7].
Through research led by Roberts, a number of highly skilled scientists       that trained at Southampton       have filled high-profile industry posts.
PhD students McGowan and Bernau       are CEO at Armada       Exploration and Project Geologist at Micon International respectively.
McGowan was actively       involved in the discovery of the Kamoa Deposit in DRC.
Masters student       Adam Burley (1996-2000)       was, until July 2013, President of Kennecott Eagle Minerals Co. and is now       managing strategy,       growth and innovation for copper at Rio Tinto.
Roberts has also actively shared his expertise and research findings with       industry, as is       demonstrated by his pivotal role in a recent workshop.
In June 2013       Roberts organised and       delivered a capacity-building workshop, African Metallogeny II &#8212; Base         Metals in Basins in Kitwe,       Zambia.
The aim of this workshop, supported by UNESCO, "is to train         young African geoscientists         in the specific field of metallogeny, i.e.
practical aspects of the         genesis of ore deposits that can be       applied in the formulation of future exploration strategies" [5.8].
The course was attended by over       50 delegates from 14 countries and twenty mining companies such as Rio       Tinto, First Quantum       and Barrick.
Feedback from delegates was very positive, particularly       praising the link between       theory and practical exposure to example rocks.
Delegate feedback       included: "The workshop         structure was fantastic with the right balance between lectures, mine         visits and core viewing.
I         personally enjoyed that while looking at the core you guys assigned         tasks that made our         observation of the rocks, alteration and mineralization styles and         discussion about stratigraphic         positioning much more objective.
", "The workshop was one of the         best that I've ever participated in         10 years of professional life.
I believe that you guys had found the         right structure for future events"       and "Thanks for organising an excellent workshop.
The Barrick team         really appreciated the effort         and time you put into organising the workshop and the seamless execution"       [5.9].
