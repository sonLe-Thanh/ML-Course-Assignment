     Widening access to and ensuring professional practice is "fit for       purpose' is a key concern of Governments in the UK and overseas.
This       policy drive by Governments has led directly to new modes of delivering       learning and teaching within and without universities, with the aim of       developing more evidence-based practice and encouraging professional       associations to open up alternative routes to professional practice,       including differing ways of categorising the "professional'.
In the       information profession, developments in relation to accrediting and       recognising work-based learning formally and devising Continuing       Professional Development (CPD) routes into professional practice have       employed frameworks and methodologies developed by the Aberystwyth       researchers.
Research by Broady-Preston and Bell into the effects of the operational       convergence of information and library services and the necessity for a       hybrid model of practice, underpinned the development of an in-service       training programme for South African Librarians [5.8].
Frameworks       identifying and analysing professional skills and competencies devised by       Broady-Preston and Preston resulted in the conceptualisation of 'blurring       professional boundaries' and the concomitant need to develop blended       information professionals, directly informing curriculum review at the       University of Sheffield [5.2], the re-conceptualisation and       repositioning of Australian Library and Information Science education [5.6]       and CPD frameworks in Australia, India, New Zealand and the Caribbean [5.3].
The 2009 qualitative methodology for reconfiguring concepts of       professional identify developed by Broady-Preston informed the future       direction of the library and information profession in Australia overall,       being used in a variety of research and policy initiatives funded by the       Australian Government.
The Australian Learning and Teaching Council       Project employed it in its 2010-11 identification of the knowledge base       required to modernise the information profession in Australia to meet the       needs of 21st century practice, and more specifically, to develop a       structured, modular competency framework for health librarianship in the       Health Libraries Australia (HLA) Research Project, 2009-2011[5.4, 5.5].
Broady-Preston's 2009 work on the future of the information profession and       professional practice, together with the identification of skills and       competencies for practice was used to identify future directions for the       Australian Health Library profession by ALIA (Australian Library and       Information Association) [5.4].
CPD schemes and activity constitute a discrete sub-section of work in       relation to determining professional identity, skills, knowledge and       competencies, directly contributing to developing more robust and rigorous       evidenced-based practice.
In 2008, Broady-Preston was appointed to two       CILIP Council Task and Finish Groups, the first designing and reviewing       the Framework of Qualifications and Accreditation (FoQA) for the       profession, and the second established to determine policy in relation to       Foundation Degrees [5.2].
The purpose of both groups was to       examine future needs for CPD in professional practice, including       identifying mechanisms for recognising and accrediting work-based learning       and requirements for lifelong learning in professional practice.
This led       to the production of a pioneering light-touch mandatory CPD programme for       professional practice by CILIP, one of only two developed for the       profession globally, evaluated subsequently by Broady-Preston in 2009.
Widespread debate within the profession took place during and following       the presentation of the scheme and its evaluative model at the World       Congress in 2009.
The debate was such that CILIP UK launched a survey of       their members in January 2010, revisiting their 2009 policy decision to       introduce mandatory CPD [5.8].
This led subsequently to the       development of a global framework for evaluating mandatory professional       CPD schemes, developed in conjunction with colleagues in New Zealand.
A       comparative critique of the two schemes formed the basis for a structured       workshop discussion at the IFLA World Library and Information Congress       August 2010 in Gothenburg, Sweden, focusing on the role and relevance of       mandatory CPD activity in motivating and regenerating the contemporary       information profession, led by Broady-Preston.
This contributed to the       temporary suspension in 2011 of the original UK scheme with its subsequent       revision and re-introduction in 2013 as a Revalidation scheme [5.1].
Further evidence of policy development and improvements to professional       practice is demonstrated by Broady-Preston's appointments and advisory       roles to Government and professional bodies resulting from the above,       including: 2009-10 membership of the Museums, Libraries and Archives       Council (MLA) Steering Group, Apprenticeships and Foundation Degrees; 2012       Adviser and Evaluator for the new CILIP Professional Knowledge and Skills       Base (PKSB) and the development of flexible CPD and access routes into       professional practice; and her 2013 appointment by the EU ESCO (European       Skills/Competences qualifications and Occupations) Secretariat to the ESCO       Arts, Entertainment and Recreation Reference group, a European Commission       Europe-wide initiative to identify and categorise skills, competences,       qualifications and occupations in a standard way, using standard       terminology in all EU languages and an open format, usable by third       parties' software [5.9].
