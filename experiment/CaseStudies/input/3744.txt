     This impact case study relates to important changes in marine policy at       the local, national and international levels in the period 2008-13.
Policy       has been informed and underpinned by the research carried out by SMRU in       St Andrews since 1996, which has allowed sea mammal behaviour, abundance       and distribution to be understood to a robust degree.
The main impact       areas are:            Enabling effective conservation of marine mammals in UK, EU and         international waters       Defining EU policy objectives for marine mammal conservation       Delivering UK obligations arising from EU legal instruments       Reducing marine mammal bycatch by over 90% in key fisheries          Conservation of Seals in UK Waters       SMRU has a critical role undertaking the research that underpins       Government policy in relation to seals.
The Scottish Government       highlighted in 2012 the     "vital work undertaken by SMRU in support of the development of         Scottish Government policy on seal management" [S1].
In the Moray Firth, conflicts arising between fishermen and seals led to       widespread shooting of seals.
SMRU research showed that specific `rogue'       seals were responsible, suggesting that a targeted response was crucial to       the co-management of this seal-fishery conflict.
The Scottish Government [S1]       has recognised that research by SMRU was "instrumental in the success"       of the Moray Firth Seal Management Plan (MFSMP) which was a       landmark agreement forged between all interested parties.
The result was a       "dramatic reduction (~60%) in seal shooting in the area" [S1].
The success of the MFSMP led to the development, successful drafting and       progression to legislation of the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010 [S6],       which relied heavily on the seal research carried out by SMRU.
It       introduces a new system within Scotland for licensing of the removal and       disturbance of seals and for placing protective measures on seals when       that is deemed necessary.
This licensing scheme has "greatly improved         the ability of Ministers to protect seals" according to the       principal marine advisor to Scottish Natural Heritage [S2].
The       Scottish Government has acknowledged     "The research undertaken by SMRU has informed all these important         policy developments" [S1].
Defining EU policy objectives for marine mammal conservation       SMRU's research has been instrumental in the development of policy on       marine mammal conservation at an EU level, such as the Marine Strategy         Framework Directive (MSFD) (2010) [S7], as marine mammal       population trajectories and bycatch levels are key targets and indicators       for defining `good environmental status' for the seas around our       coastline.
The Head of Marine Advice for the UK Joint Nature Conservation       Committee stated in 2013:     "St Andrews research has been particularly effective and therefore         influential on policy and policy implementation.
I chaired EU level         groups that examined the scientific evidence around these issues that         has led to policy changes and in doing so was able to assess and draw         upon St Andrews (and other) research.
I thus feel in a good position to         assess the relative importance of the St Andrews work."
And       continued:     "The St Andrews work in particular helped to underpin EU Regulation         812/2004 and subsequent amendments.
This regulation has undoubtedly         helped to reduce small cetacean bycatch within EU waters.
It has also         allowed the setting of suitable targets to describe Good Environmental         Status under the EU's Marine Strategy Framework Directive."
[S3]     Delivering obligations arising from UK and EU legal instruments       The EU Habitats Directive (1992) and MSFD (2010) place legal obligations       on Member States to assess and report on the conservation status of their       marine mammal populations.
These directives form the basis of national       marine environmental planning in the UK.
The underpinning research       required to meet these obligations is delivered by SMRU.
In particular,       the large-scale abundance surveys (SCANS, SCANS-II and CODA) developed       robust methodology that has become the "gold standard" and has been widely       emulated in surveys of the waters of other European countries.
The large       majority of the information on cetacean distribution and abundance used by       the UK to report under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive [S8]       was generated by these SMRU-led surveys.
Other EU countries bordering the       Atlantic Ocean have also made extensive use of this information.
A DEFRA spokesperson commented:     "Through its coordination of the Europe-wide SCANS and CODA surveys,         SMRU has played a notable role in the subsequent determination of the         conservation status of cetacean species to be determined for European         Atlantic waters, which is a requirement for all relevant EU Member         States under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive."
[S4]     In 2013, Scottish Natural Heritage said:     "The joint objectives of maintaining `favourable conservation status'         and `good environmental status' in the context of European directives is         integral to the conservation objectives set out in the Scottish Marine         Plan.
The research done by SMRU sustains our ability to uphold those         objectives for some of the most highly valued conservation assets."
[S2]     Reducing bycatch       Under the EU Habitats Directive, MSFD, Council regulation 812/2004, the UK       is required to reduce marine mammal bycatch to levels that are       sustainable.
To address these obligations, SMRU has implemented an       observer scheme on UK fishing boats to quantify bycatch.
Furthermore, SMRU       has identified and helped to implement specific acoustic deterrent devices       (Pingers) that have been effective in reducing cetacean bycatch by over       90% from over 400 animals in 2004/5 to just a handful in 2010-12 in the       Pair-trawl bass fishery in the English Channel [S4].
SMRU research       has also shown that Pingers deployed in the Cornish Offshore Gillnet       fishery in the period 2009-12 can reduce porpoise bycatch by over 90%, and       since July 2013 the UK Marine Management Organisation is enforcing this       use of Pingers in this fishery.
A DEFRA spokesperson stated in 2013:     "The new approaches developed by SMRU on bycatch limits for small         cetaceans have been adopted as the de facto European standard for other         Member States to achieve conservation goals."
[S4]     The Head of Marine Advice for the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee       states that:       "The St Andrews work led by Simon Northridge on bycatch of cetaceans in         fisheries is world class.
The UK is widely praised as having a state of         the art bycatch observer scheme, that has worked well with the fishermen         stakeholder community, and has also been influential in developing         techniques for minimising that bycatch.
When carrying out this sort of         practical research, it is absolutely critical to be sensitive to the         concerns and problems facing the fishermen, and the St Andrews team has         been exemplary in this regard.
This work has been published in papers         and in reports, but the contributions through the ICES and EU Expert         groups should not be overlooked as they are crucial to policy and policy         development in the EU."
[S3]     Finally, the Head of Science at the International Whaling Commission       stated in 2013:       "I would just like to state that the work of SMRU on matters related to         cetacean conservation and management has been of immeasurable value to         our work and to cetacean conservation.
The theoretical and practical         developments that have arisen from SMRU scientists represent a         remarkable degree of innovation from a single group.
The impact on the         conservation and management has been profound" [S5].
