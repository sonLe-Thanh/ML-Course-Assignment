     The research outlined above has had multifarious impacts: it has       influenced central and local government policies relating to play and       school transport; contributed to public discourse about, and engagement       with, the same issues; and improved health, welfare and quality of life in       many UK communities through, for example, their greater use of walking       buses.
Stakeholder engagement: Mackett has communicated his research       findings to government and community stakeholders through more than 25       invited presentations since 2008.
These have included conferences and       seminars for professionals involved in children's travel and play,       including the Play Research Network (1 Feb 2008), Play Scotland (19 Nov       2008), the Health and Consumers Directorate General of the EU (11 Feb       2011), the West Midlands Region School Travel Advisors (3 March 2011), and       at invited seminars in Romania (10 November 2008) the USA (20 Feb 2009)       and New Zealand (5 Nov 2012).
Informing policy advocacy: The Sustainable Development       Commission, formerly the UK government's independent adviser on       sustainable development, cited Mackett's research on calories burned by       children undertaking various activities and using various modes of travel       in its 2011 report `Fairness in a Car-dependent Society', quoting various       results as part of the discussion about obesity [a, pages 29, 67].
Advocacy groups such as Sustrans and Living Streets, and local groups,       frequently cite Mackett's research as evidence for action to be undertaken       to increase children's physical activity.
For example, Sustrans quoted       Mackett in an October 2011 submission on road safety to the parliamentary       Transport Select Committee [b], while Living Streets cited his work in an       expert paper included in NICE public health guidance on promoting walking       and cycling, issued in November 2012 [c].
`State of Play', published by       the Association of Play Industries for use by advocates of children's play       and the play equipment industry, quotes Mackett in outlining the benefits       of play for children's health and in claiming that children tend to walk       when they go out to play.
They use this evidence to argue for safer         streets and places for play [d, page 11].
Play England, a charity       supported by government departments and industry, which seeks to promote       the vision in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, used Mackett's       research to argue for the health benefits of children's play, and       Play Wales used the research to provide evidence for public health         specialists, primary care teams and healthy school co-ordinators about         the benefits of children's play [e, pages 4-5; f, page 2].
Influence on policy documents and guidelines: In 2008, the       National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) produced       `Guidance on physical activity, play and sport for pre-school and school       age children' for health and transport policy makers and practitioners,       which includes a cost-effectiveness analysis of four interventions to       increase child and adolescent physical activity.
One of the interventions       considered was walking buses to school: evidence from Mackett's         research was used by the NICE team to demonstrate that this was the most         cost-effective intervention [g, pages 5-12, 27-29].
Additionally,       the research on the benefits of play has been widely taken up by         central and local government.
It was cited in the document `Fair       Play: A Consultation on the Play Strategy, A Commitment from the       Children's Plan' issued by the Department for Children, Schools and       Families and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport [h], which says:       "Active play is also one of the best ways for children to burn calories       outside of PE lessons."
[h, page 10].
This consultation was used to         develop the National Play Strategy, published in December 2008 and       which set out the government's 10-year vision to deliver more and better       play opportunities for children in England.
Implementation by local authorities: Conwy Active for Life,       published by Conwy County Borough Council (2011) "to strategically       prioritise effective delivery mechanisms to ensure that Conwy is a county       where physical activity is at the heart of the community", cites Mackett's       research about the benefits of various types of play for children [i, page       12].
Figures from the Reducing Children's Car Use study published in 2004       are used to calculate of the number of calories consumed walking and         cycling to school in the School Travel Health Check (STHC) tool       which is used by local authorities and schools to set priorities,         outcomes and milestones to improve active and sustainable travel to       school [j].
In 2011, the STHC was used by 29 local authorities, 4,626       schools, and over 1.5 million pupils, for example in Plymouth, Bristol and       Cornwall [k].
The STHC was also used in the 2012 South East Dorset       Multi-Modal Transport Study [k], which led to the adoption of School       Travel Plans in Bournemouth to encourage more walking and cycling to       school and has been used by Dorset County Council to set targets for       walking and cycling.
This strategy to increase working and cycling by       children will require a budget of &#163;2.042m over 15 years [k].
Informing media coverage: This has helped to further inform         public understanding of the importance of children's activity.
Since       2008, this has included an article on the effects of parental choice of       school on children's physical activity levels, in the Daily Telegraph; the       risk of children whose parents drive them a lot becoming car-dependent       adults, in the New York Times; and a BBC Breakfast television feature on       children's independent movement on urban areas.
[l]     Improving children's health through the institution of walking           buses to school: Since the publication of the 2008 NICE       guidance on physical activity, play and sport for children (which drew on       Mackett's research, as noted above), walking buses have been set up         around the country.
130 now exist in Staffordshire, for example; a       further 60 have been set up in Kent and 30 in West Sussex [m].
The       benefits of these buses extend, moreover, beyond positive impacts on       children's health and well-being to environmental benefits arising         from reductions in the number of car journeys made to school: in       Thurrock, Essex, for instance, estimates show walking buses have saved         an average of 2160g of CO2 per mile [n].
Preventing school closures: Campaigners used the research       on children's travel to school to help make the case to keep Bearsden       Primary School at Bearsden Cross, in East Dunbartonshire, Scotland, rather       then move to Castlehill where, it was claimed, more children would need to       travel by car [o].
Campaigners said that closure would damage educational       outcomes, represent poor value for the council taxpayer and harm the       commercial and community heart of Bearsden.
The school was subsequently       saved [o].
