     Promoting musicians' health     CPS research has shaped attitudes and driven the health promotion agenda       in higher music       education and more broadly within the profession.
In 2009 for instance,       Williamon collaborated with       staff of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama to design Body         Matters, a module based on       evidence-informed health initiatives at the RCM and since delivered to       approximately 30 UG and       PG students annually [S1].
Similarly in 2013, the Conservatorio della       Svizzera Italiana (Switzerland)       launched a module on musicians' health and fitness, designed by Williamon       and delivered by       performance scientists at the Conservatorio to over 50 UG students thus       far [S2].
Since 2000,       several health-related curriculum initiatives have emerged across the UK       conservatoire sector,       including those at the RNCM, RWCMD and Trinity Laban, informed by (and       often mirroring) those       instituted by the CPS within the RCM's own programmes.
The CPS has also       partnered with the       UCL School of Medicine, British Association of Performing Arts Medicine       (BAPAM) and Trinity       Laban's Department of Dance Science to offer the world's first MSc in       Performing Arts Medicine.
Based at UCL and run in parallel with the RCM's MSc in Performance       Science, the programme       trains health professionals to identify and treat injuries and ill-health       experienced by performing       artists [S3].
Since 2011, over 20 health professionals have received       training, supplying the next       generation of doctors, physiotherapists, counsellors and so on to work       within BAPAM and other       international performing arts medicine clinics.
The impact of the CPS on the occupational health of professional       musicians continues to be       significant.
Williamon is a founder member of BAPAM's Education and       Training Advisory Group       (2009); the Group's activities, which has included a nation-wide health       promotion seminar series       for music teachers and an online Health Advice Resources Area, has been       directly informed by       CPS research [S4].
Williamon also worked in an advisory capacity in the       establishment of the       Portuguese Association for Performing Arts Medicine, launched in 2010.
Setting the agenda for the       next decade, the CPS unveiled two major initiatives in 2013.
Musical         Impact, the largest study of its       kind worldwide, is a four-year AHRC-funded project (awarded February 2013)       that seeks to       generate new knowledge of chronic and acute health problems of musicians       and to test effective       solutions [G2].
Creative Practice as Mutual Recovery, a five-year       AHRC-funded project with the       University of Nottingham Institute of Mental Health (awarded February       2013), builds upon the       growing body of evidence showing that learning to make music can offer       significant mental health       benefits for NHS service users and older adults; less is known, however,       about the benefits for the       musicians who facilitate such work.
This project directly examines the       hypothesis that musicians       and their learners can, through shared musical experiences,       mutually enhance wellbeing and       develop more meaningful and resilient lives [G3].
Protecting musicians' hearing     Arising from the health promotion research, the CPS has collaborated       since 2008 with the UCL Ear       Institute and the engineering firm Audio3 to conduct comprehensive hearing       screening       programmes for student and professional musicians and to develop noise       monitoring procedures       for beneficiaries including the Royal Opera House.
The hearing research       has informed the design       of Audio3's SoundScreener, a new low-cost touchscreen audiometer       tested in a first phase with       10,000 people through Deafness Research UK and now being tested in phase 2       exclusively with       RCM musicians, prior to a planned roll-out across member institutions of       Conservatoires UK in       2015.
In addition, the noise monitoring research was the catalyst for the       development of Audio3's       SoundBadge, the world's smallest wearable noise dosimeter and sound       level meter system [S5].
Addressing performance-related stress     Acknowledging the high incidence and profound effect of performance       anxiety among musicians,       the CPS collaborated with Imperial College Department of Bioengineering       and the Royal Academy       of Engineering in Virtuoso Stress (June 2008), an interactive       concert at the Science Museum's       Dana Centre featuring a live experiment using bioengineering equipment to       measure musicians'       heart rate, breathing rate and stress response as they performed [S6].
In       2012, the CPS unveiled       its Performance Simulator; built in collaboration with the       creative design firm Studiohead [S7], the       simulator offers musicians a realistic space in which to `practise'       performing in front of an       interactive, virtual audience or audition panel.
The simulator was       featured in a 30-minute       documentary, `The scalpel and the bow', broadcast as part of the BBC Radio       3 series Between the         Ears (January 2013), and on Radio 3's Music Matters (April       2013) [S9].
In July 2013, it was       transported to the Cheltenham Music Festival and showcased as part of What's         it Like to be a         Performer?, where members of the public were able perform `on stage'       in front of the simulated       audience [S9].
Developing dialogue     CPS research into musicians' health and wellbeing has been disseminated       widely via the       International Symposium on Performance Science (ISPS) and its       associated published       Proceedings.
Founded by Williamon in 2007, in part to spark dialogue and       debate on the very       latest findings into musicians' health, the first ISPS was convened at       Porto's iconic Casa da         M&#250;sica, with subsequent conferences in Auckland (2009), Toronto       (2011) and Vienna (2013), all of       which have been co-chaired by Williamon.
Thus far, over 700 delegates from       more than 30       countries have attended the conferences, a majority of whom are themselves       performers, teachers       or otherwise engaged in portfolio musical careers.
At least one keynote       speech at each event has       addressed musicians' health, and through the many spoken papers, posters       and workshops       devoted to this topic, delegates have gained: (i) an increased awareness       of the state of the art in       the field, (ii) a forum for sharing and building good practice, drawn from       international perspectives,       and (iii) an online repository of research papers, freely available at www.performancescience.org.
It is common for research from the symposia to capture public attention,       as evidenced with the       recent 25-minute summary of ISPS 2013, Performance Science: Die         Wissenschaft entdeckt das         Musizieren, broadcast on Austrian Radio 1 (&#214;1) [S10].
The       forthcoming ISPS will be convened in       Kyoto in 2015.
