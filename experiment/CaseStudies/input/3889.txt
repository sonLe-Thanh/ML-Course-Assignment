     Change in the understanding of atopy pathogenesis has led to change           in clinical practice     A significant minority (9%) of the UK population carries one or more FLG       null alleles [1], therefore the increased risk of atopic disease affects       an estimated 5.7 million people, of whom approximately 2.4 million (42%)       [2] are likely to develop atopic eczema which is directly attributable to       FLG haploinsufficiency [3,4].
An additional 10.6% of the population       are homozygous for the lowest copy number variants of FLG,       associated with an increased risk of eczema (odds ratio ~1.67) [vi].
FLG       mutations increase the risk of disease at every stage of the so-called       `atopic march', from eczema early in life, to asthma, food allergy and       later allergic rhinitis [1,2].
The paradigm shift in understanding atopy has changed the focus of       clinical care to epidermal barrier function [5,6].
Since 2008, the       filaggrin/atopy link has been the subject of 90 review articles [PubMed       search: filaggrin AND atopic 31/10/2013].
The research has attracted six       major national/international research prizes, including the American Skin       Association Achievement Award 2009.
The research focus on barrier function has informed the development of       therapeutic guidelines.
Thus, the NICE guidelines state: "Atopic eczema       often has a genetic component that leads to the breakdown of the skin       barrier.
This makes the skin susceptible to trigger factors, including       irritants and allergens, which can make the eczema worse" (http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG57/QuickRefGuide/pdf/English).
The NICE guideline on treatment emphasises the importance of emollient use       to improve skin barrier function, now a key quality statement: "Children       with atopic eczema are prescribed sufficient quantities (250-500 g weekly)       from a choice of unperfumed emollients for daily use."
(http://publications.nice.org.uk/atopic-eczema-in-children-qs44/list-of-quality-statements).
This       new understanding has been conveyed in undergraduate and postgraduate       teaching.
Examples include the UK Advanced Paediatric Dermatology Course,       a lecture at the British Association of Dermatologists' Annual meeting       2013 and the NHS educational web pages `NHS inform' and `NHS choices' [7].
National and international public interest has increased awareness           of atopic disease     The eczema genetic discovery has led to improved public understanding of       science: Irwin McLean and Sara Brown have spoken to       capacity audiences at Caf&#233; Science Dundee [8]; on a wider scale, they have       achieved major worldwide publicity, including front-page coverage by every       major newspaper in the UK, BBC News website [9] and Newsnight, ITV, Sky       News and a total of &gt;100 TV and radio interviews.
Media exposure has       continued with the intense interest in peanut allergy.
The message of skin barrier impairment in eczema has increased public       understanding of atopic disease, which improves compliance with emollient       therapy [10].
The National Eczema Society explains: "If you have eczema         ...the protective barrier is therefore not as good as it should be...         skin with eczema is more liable to become red and inflamed on contact         with substances that are known to irritate or cause an allergic reaction."

The British Association of Dermatologists' patient information leaflet on       atopic eczema (http://www.bad.org.uk/site/792/default.aspx)       explains the genetically-determined skin barrier defect and use of       emollient.
FLG genotype is used to stratify patients for clinical care and           clinical trials     The knowledge that FLG-null genotype is most strongly associated       with persistent, severe eczema and multiple atopic co-morbidities has       facilitated clinical sub-classification [2].
In patients with signs of       filaggrin deficiency, specific attention may be paid to the possible       development of asthma and food allergy.
Asthma management in particular is       optimised by early recognition in children (http://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/guidelines/asthma-guidelines.aspx).
Clinical trials of barrier enhancement interventions are underway.
The       Barrier Enhancement for Eczema Prevention study (2010-11) demonstrated a       50% reduction in eczema incidence in babies receiving daily emollients,       interacting with FLG genotype (http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN84854178).
A larger study is funded by the NIHR HTA Programme: `A randomised controlled       trial to determine whether skin barrier enhancement with emollients can       prevent eczema in high risk children' in which 1282 high-risk babies will       be screened for FLG mutations and monitored for development of       eczema, asthma and hay fever (http://www.nets.nihr.ac.uk/projects/hta/126712).
Collectively, these three allergic diseases rank sixth for annual       expenditures among chronic health conditions in the US, with a total       estimated bill of ~$24billion (http://www.epa.gov/ORD/gems/scinews_aeroallergens.htm).
A randomised controlled trial of silk therapeutic clothing for the       long-term management of eczema in children (http://www.hta.ac.uk/project/2984.asp)       also includes our FLG genotype-stratified analysis.
The finding that intragenic copy number variation determines eczema risk       with a dose-dependent effect [vi] indicates that an increase       in functional filaggrin of only 5-10% is sufficient to significantly       reduce eczema risk.
This gives added impetus to the search for filaggrin       up-regulation therapies which would be applicable to 33% of the population       carrying low copy number [vi].
