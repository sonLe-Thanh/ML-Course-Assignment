     UCL's impact on the way that international trials in Alzheimer's disease       use brain imaging has been considerable.
Our Boundary Shift Integral       method has provided a precise, regulatory- compliant means of assessing       whether a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease could modify the       disease course by slowing the rate of atrophy.
It has therefore had a       significant impact on clinical trial protocols across phases 2-3 by       reducing the number of patients needed for imaging outcomes, thus reducing       costs and reducing participant exposure to potential side effects.
Additionally the techniques have been shown to be useful clinically -       individuals with very early Alzheimer's disease show increased rates of       brain atrophy relative to healthy controls.
Adoption of our methods in clinical trials: Historically,       image analysis for trial outcomes involved relatively crude and expensive       manual measurements of brain volumes or regions from imaging at baseline       and end of study to try to show an effect of the therapy on the       progression of atrophy.
The method of choice was manual tracing of regions       of interest on a brain scan.
These measures were limited to those areas       easy to define (e.g.
hippocampus) but more importantly were manual, and       therefore both labour intensive and error prone.
Our image analysis       methods removed the need for these manual measurements and at the same       time also greatly improved the precision and reliability of the measures       (5 times lower variance on scan-rescan testing) [a].
This led to       its increasing uptake as the method of choice for AD trials (and now other       diseases).
The Boundary Shift Integral has become the most widely used method of       analysing brain atrophy in trials in Alzheimer's disease and in related       disorders.
Trials using UCL's techniques include most recently the largest       international immunotherapy trials in AD led by Elan/Janssen and       Pfizer/Wyeth [b], [c].
The method provides a biomarker       that can be used as a clinical trial endpoint to establish whether a       candidate drug can slow brain atrophy (a long established downstream       effect of the disease).
Many trial protocols (including from Pfizer,       Wyeth, Elan, Janssen, Roche, BMS) have used this analysis as a secondary       endpoint.
Lundbeck chose to use the Boundary Shift Integral measure as       their primary outcome to assess whether memantine had any       disease-modification effects in Alzheimer's disease [d].
(The       study showed no benefit of memantine on rates of brain atrophy.)
Furthermore, the European Medicines Agency has recently issued draft       opinion indicating that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of hippocampal       volume is a valid approach for selecting people in the early,       pre-dementia, stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) for clinical trials [e].
Economic benefits to pharmaceutical companies: The use of       image analysis allows trials to be conducted using far fewer subjects than       would have been needed to power a study using clinical outcomes.
The       memantine trial described above was conducted in fewer than half as many       subjects as would have been needed otherwise (power calculations conducted       by Lundbeck - see [e]).
This effectively reduced the cost to the       company of this study by several million dollars.
Furthermore, trial       participant exposure to potential side-effects was reduced.
Economic benefits to companies providing services to the           pharmaceutical industry: Introduction of our techniques has       also had a significant benefit to the UK economy, through the provision of       image analysis services to foreign companies.
The image analysis unit at       the Dementia Research Unit has provided ~&#163;5m in image analysis services to       Janssen, Elan, Pfizer, Wyeth, and Lundbeck in the 2008-13 period [f].
IXICO (an Imaging CRO providing end to end imaging solutions for clinical       trials) uses our boundary shift integral technique under licence and has       attracted a number of large contracts [g].
They report that:     "Between January 2008 and July 2013, we used the BSI with three of the         world's top 10 pharmaceutical companies and small biotechs, including on         high-profile pivotal trials of potential treatments for mild-moderate         Alzheimer's Disease, and prodromal Alzheimer's disease.
We have         processed 10s of thousands of patient images in this period... IXICO's         ability to offer BSI to pharmaceutical companies enabled UCL technology         to continue to have high impact in clinical trial market at a time when         many pharmaceutical companies were reducing their use of academic groups         for image analysis in large clinical trials... Involvement of IXICO in         pivotal trials in which the Boundary Shift Integral was one of the         services we offered contributed to IXICO's significant growth in revenue         and reaching profitability during the 2008-2013 period."
Furthermore, in the US, our techniques have been used in a large number       of studies by image analysis companies e.g.
Bioclinica [h] and       Synarc [i], who report that:     "The development, validation and introduction of the Boundary Shift         Integral (BSI) was Widely recognized as a major advance for the field.
The BSI subsequently established itself as one of the most important         techniques for the measurement of rates of atrophy in AD clinical         trials.
The BSI has been employed in many of the most high profile         international clinical trials including several of those analysed by         Synarc.
In the period January 2008 - July 2013 Synarc has used this         technique in 12 clinical trials.
The contribution of the BSI along with         the broader work by Professor Nick Fox is widely recognized as being         very important in the industry.
His work in developing         registration-based methods or measuring brain changes and the use of the         BSI to quantify atrophy measurements has been seen as a standard against         which other techniques are compared.
These developments have had a major         commercial impact well beyond academia."
Use in investigating other diseases: The Boundary Shift       Integral technique is not simply applicable to Alzheimer's disease.
Its       use has now begun to spread to the investigation of other diseases,       including Huntington's disease [j], frontotemporal dementia and MS       [k].
