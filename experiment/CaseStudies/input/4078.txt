     Resistance mapping informs local authority pest management           strategies     Resistance survey data generated by the VPU using the new molecular       methodology was       commissioned by West Berkshire Council and used in their application to       the Health and Safety       Executive (the Competent Authority in the UK responsible for the       registration of rodenticides) for       the limited emergency use of anticoagulants containing either brodifacoum,       flocoumafen or       difethialone, in areas where there was resistance.
The key contact was Sue       Gore, Team Leader       and Principal Environmental Health Officer, who has provided the following       statement:       "Verification of resistance in the West Berkshire area has enabled the       Council to advise it's       residents more accurately on the best methods to try and reduce rat       populations".
As the new molecular methodology for identifying anticoagulant resistance       does not require       testing on live animals, it is extremely useful as a tool for mapping the       distribution of different       mutations across the globe.
In the UK, the VPU is using the molecular       methodology [4] to map the       distribution of resistance in Norway rats and is providing this       information to the Industry and local       authorities.
VPU is working with the University of Huddersfield on this       project, with the VPU       focusing on central southern England and Huddersfield focusing on areas       further north.
The local       authorities benefit from this information as it helps them to manage their       rodenticide usage and       tailor their pest management strategies accordingly.
The VPU, with input from Dr Buckle, is involved in Norway rat surveys in       the UK, Libya, US,       Russia, Mexico and Brazil, and in house mouse surveys in the UK, the US       and the Azores.
The School currently has a long-standing agreement with a well-recognized       international agro-chemical       company which stems from earlier contracts (beginning in 1989) with       predecessors of       that Company.
In addition, there have been numerous commercial contracts       with UK and       European companies, as well as work for local authorities in the UK.
Recently, expert opinion has       been provided to a US law firm representing the interests of an       international company regarding       the use of its products in the US.
Further information about these       activities may be requested and,       insofar as is possible, will be made available if the confidentiality       restrictions in the contracts allow.
New methodologies adopted by global plant science industry       Crop Life International is a global federation representing leaders in the       plant science industry such       as Bayer, Syngenta, Rentokil, Sorex, BASF, LiphaTech and PelGar.
In 2001,       the Rodenticide       Resistance Action Committee (RRAC) of Crop Life International funded       Prescott's reappraisal of       resistance assessment methodologies, which led to his development of a new       standardized       methodology for identifying and quantifying physiological resistance in       Norway rats and house       mice [5].
In 2003, the RRAC adopted this new methodology and released it       as a technical       monograph [a, cites Prescott et al., (2007) International Journal of         Pest Management, 53 (4): 265-272].
This standardised methodology is currently being used at the University of       Reading,       University of Lyon, France, and the Julius Kuhn Institut, Germany, to       determine the Resistance       Factors for each "species/VKORC1 mutation / anticoagulant active       ingredient" combination, in       order to provide the key link between molecular mutation of the VKORC1       gene and impact on field       efficacy.
This work is being funded by the RRAC.
Informing guidance on treating resistant rat populations in the UK       In 2010, Buckle and Prescott were co-authors on a report for the       Rodenticide Resistance Action       Group (RRAG), which provided guidance on treating resistant rat       populations in the UK [b].
The       RRAG is a UK-based group consisting of representatives from Universities,       government agencies       and all sectors of the pest control industry, with expertise in       rodenticide resistance.
The guidance       describes the need to monitor rodent infestations and how the new       molecular methodologies can       help achieve this.
It also describes how anticoagulant substances that are       resisted by certain       populations should cease to be used and alternative control methods       explored.
These two guiding       principles were then incorporated into guidance from the European Biocidal       Products Forum       (EBPF), which represents 60 companies in the European biocides industry       [c].
Influencing UK and European Union risk mitigation strategies       A RRAG report, containing detailed resistance survey data generated by the       VPU [2], was       submitted to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), which is the UK       Competent Authority       responsible for the European Biocidal Products Directive and its       replacement as of September 1st       2013, the EU Biocides Regulation.
The report was then passed on to the       European Commission in       response to a request prompted by The Netherlands that all European Union       Member States       provide an update on rodenticide resistance.
The VPUs data formed part of       the UKs response to       the Commission's request [d].
Prescott subsequently collaborated with Professor Berny (University of       Lyon, France) and Dr       Jacob (Julius Kuhn Institut, Germany) on a bid for a European Commission       Tender to review the       Risk Mitigation Measures for anticoagulant rodenticide use across Europe.
They were awarded the       contract in December 2012.
A member of the European Commission stated that       "the teams         recruited for this project include the three most prominent European         academic research teams in         the field of AR expertise, both with respect to resistance detection,         monitoring and management         and non-target poisoning" [e].
