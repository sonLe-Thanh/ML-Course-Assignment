     The Bumblebee Conservation Trust (BBCT) was founded in 2006 at the       University of Stirling by Dave Goulson.
BBCT is a registered charity and       limited company devoted to translating what we have learned about       bumblebee biology into practical measures to conserve this declining group       of pollinators.
The impacts outlined in this case study have all occurred       during the period 2008 &#8212; 2013 with the relevant underpinning research       outputs including; detailed knowledge of bumblebee foraging and nesting       needs, understanding of their distributions, population density and       dispersal abilities, and knowledge on the scale at which habitat       manipulations are required to influence bumblebee population size.
The charity has grown from a starting point of no paid staff, no members       and no funds to have 8,000 members (plus 13,000 followers on Twitter) and       provide employment for 12 staff (Feb 2013).
It has main offices in       Stirling and Eastleigh (Hants), and further staff based in Kent and South       Wales.
All members receive wildflower seeds, an identification poster and       a quarterly newsletter.
They are strongly encouraged to get involved in       trust activities which include bumblebee identification training days and       three different bumblebee recording schemes.
Between them these schemes       have so far generated &gt;100,000 individual bee records sent in by       &gt;12,000 recorders.
Impacts arising from this work:            Lobbying: Our activities have led to a number of invitations to meet         with politicians, including members of the Scottish and European         Parliaments, Ministers, and even an invitation to visit to No.10.
We had         input to the recent "Postnote" (Parliamentary briefing notes) on         Pollination.
Following the publication of two landmark papers in Science         on bees and neonicotinoid pesticides (Whitehorn et al.
2012, and one         from a French research group, Henry et al.
2012), Goulson has been         invited to give evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee         investigation into Insects and Insecticides, an enquiry which was         launched in part as a result of the publication of Whitehorn et al.
He         was also asked to give a talk to the All Party Parliamentary Group on         Agroecology (both in Westminster).
Goulson was asked by EFSA to input         into the development of new protocols for evaluating plant protection         products, and was invited to the Pesticide Safety Directorate in York to         discuss the safety of neonicotinoids.
In April 2013 the EU announced a         two year moratorium on use of neonicotinoid insecticides on flowering         crops, an outcome which can be clearly traced back to the publication of         Whitehorn et al.
and Henry et al (see section 5; Environmental Audit         Committee 2013).
Awareness: Since the launch of BBCT was featured in the front three         pages of The Independent, we have had much media coverage,         including substantial articles about bumblebees and their decline in The           Sunday Times, The Guardian, The Telegraph, The Daily Mail,         television coverage on BBC "The One Show" and BBC Breakfast News (Sept,         2008), and a 30 minute programme "The Plight of the Bumblebee" on Radio         4 (Oct, 2009).
This media coverage has substantially raised awareness of         bumblebee declines and how they may be reversed in the public         consciousness.
The publication of Whitehorn et al.
(2012) was covered by         major national newspapers across the world (e.g.
Washington Post, Le           Monde, Stern, New York Times), greatly increasing public and         political interest in the role of pesticides in bee declines.
Children: we have a mission to raise awareness in children (the land         managers of tomorrow), and to this end we obtained funding from Scottish         Natural Heritage to develop an education pack for primary schools.
This         had input from educational specialists and was trialled in several         primary schools; it has since been requested and sent out to over 260         schools.
Trust staff have visited many schools to talk about bumblebees         and advise on creating school wildlife gardens.
Wildlife gardening: In 2009 we teamed up with Wyevale Garden Centres         to run an "Insect Weekend" with displays illustrating the best plants         for bumblebees in 122 garden centres across the country.
The trust has         distributed &gt;15,000 packs of wildflower seeds.
Through an initiative         with Morrison's supermarkets, 200,000 packets of wildflower seed and         information on bumblebees were given away with bouquets of flowers in         2010.
Practical Conservation: The Trust set up the first "Bumblebee nature         reserve", an 8 ha grassland restoration project at Royal Society for the         Protection of Birds' (RSPB) Vane Farm, Loch Leven.
We obtained funding         for a major (80 ha) grassland restoration project in Carmarthenshire         with the Grasslands Trust.
With funding from Natural England and working         with various partners including RSPB, we co-ordinated a project to         reintroduce the extinct short-haired bumblebee to the UK: results from         summer 2013 have shown that at least some of these bees have now bred         successfully as new queens and workers have been observed.
More than         1,000 ha of suitable bumblebee habitat have been created in SE Kent in         advance of the reintroduction attempt.
Working with Farming &amp;         Wildlife Advisory Group and National Farmers Union, each spring and         summer our two conservation officers organise numerous "farmers days",         on-farm social gatherings at which farmers meet to discuss bumblebee         conservation and how best to manage bumblebee-friendly agri-environment         prescriptions.
Farmers very readily grasp the importance of bumblebees         as pollinators of crops and wildflowers, and we have found that this         grass-roots approach to conservation is paying great dividends in terms         of delivering bee-friendly farming.
Many more projects are in the         pipeline.
Overall, so far the trust has played a role in the creation of         &gt;2,000 ha of habitat.
