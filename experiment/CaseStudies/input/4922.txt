     Our research has led to new guidelines, setting admissions           standards to almost all social work courses, resulting in           better quality candidates.
Influencing policy: The research findings [see Section 3, R6         &amp; R7] informed national discussions between 2008 and 2012.
In 2008,         they led to an invitation to Holmstrom to join the national Social Work         Task Force (to become the Social Work Reform Board in 2010), and lead         discussions on admissions.
This resulted in Holmstrom's first         influential report [R7] which `dispelled the myths...and replaced them         with a widely acknowledged evidence base... Over a couple of years &#8212;         from the SWTF to passing recommendations to the SWRB &#8212; the work has fed         into discussions, led to a sub-group specifically on this area and to         two influential documents' [see Section 5, C1].
Holmstrom's second         `influential document' comprised the national guidance on the selection         of social-work students aimed at HE admissions tutors and partners in         England [C3], commissioned by the HEA and GSCC/HCPC to explain the HCPC         standards on admissions procedures and their interaction with the         relevant legislative and policy drivers and widening participation and         equalities issues.
Holmstrom's research `was extremely well received and         helped set a benchmark for what new procedures should be adopted by SWRB         and The College' [C2].
Influencing HE practice: Crucially, Holmstrom's admissions         guidance [C3] was specifically designed to equip social work admissions         tutors and their partners with both technical and operational guidance         and some exemplars of good practice.
It was also designed to integrate         with the criteria for programme endorsement used by The College since         2012.
It informed an HEA translational summary, Recommendations for           the Selection of Students, now held by The College, which cites         Holmstrom's contribution on p. 1 [C4].
Holmstrom's guidance `has set the         benchmark for what good admissions looks like and so the criteria for         programmes to be endorsed by The College.
...It will impact on some 97         per cent of the 250 courses currently being offered' [C2].
Furthermore,         `Perceptions are that this work is positively influencing the calibre of         entrants...there is also now a focus on quality over quantity' [C1].This         statement was echoed by an Admissions Tutor who said, evaluating         participation in one of the 7 national workshops led by Holmstrom and         funded by the HEA to develop good admissions practice, `We now have an         effective balance between personal attributes and qualifications,         ensuring that those selected are the best qualified AND most able'         [C11].
Law teaching nationally has been shaped by our research evidence       (conducted in partnership with the University of Bedfordshire, the       research reflects a distinct and material input from Sussex).
Influencing policy: Following the original research, Braye was         commissioned by HEA to conduct further research into the law field         curriculum         (see http://www.swap.ac.uk/docs/projects/socialworklaw_rpt.pdf         ).
This research was cited in the Law Commission's review of adult         social-care law as evidence of the need for legal reform (see http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/docs/           lc326_adult_social_care.pdf) and subsequently in the Department of         Health impact assessment relating to the Care Bill 2013 (see https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/ attachment_data/file/197938/Care_and_Support_Legal_Reform_IA__FINAL_.pdf,         para 6.12).
Braye provided evidence to the SWTF working group on the law         curriculum, and commented on its proposals.
Law is now more thoroughly         woven within the HCPC and TCSW requirements, and the national law         curriculum reflects Sussex input to the TCSW Law Curriculum Guide         to accompany the Professional Capability Framework [C5].
Influencing HE practice: Law learning has improved as a result         of Law e-learning resources produced by the Department.
The resources         [C6] were commissioned by SCIE on behalf of the Department of Health,         and were based on the evidence from the underpinning SCIE study [R2].
The resources were awarded first prize for innovation by the HEA         Association of Learning Technology.
Subsequent SCIE-commissioned         outcome-focused research [R3] led to the Collaborative Capacity Building         Learning Set research, with educators and students focusing specifically         on the impact of the e-learning resources.
They identified the factors         that enhance tutor engagement with their use, the positive impact on         student knowledge and confidence, and the pedagogic practices that         enhance learning.
Participants attest to the transformative change in         education practice, as exemplified by this quote from an educator: `I've         gone into (the learning set) meetings feeling bludgeoned by higher         education and my workload (and have emerged) feeling empowered to come         back and make changes.
...
In terms of professional identity, I went         from being somebody who was new to having some credibility and         professional confidence with colleagues; I felt really of value because         I was part of it ...
I've got some kind of identity within my profession         and teaching' [C11].
National teaching of communication skills with children has been           shaped by our research evidence, and communications with children have           improved             Influencing policy: In 2013, the Care Council for Wales (CCW)         reported that they have used the 3 studies commissioned from the Sussex         team to improve practice with children in Wales in the following ways:         (i) to revise the National Occupational Standards for Social Work upon         which the Wales socialwork degree is based; (ii) to inform the CCW         review of requirements for approval of the degree and increase the         requirements in relation to safeguarding; (iii) to develop, consult on         and begin to implement a framework for Continuing Professional Education         and Learning for social workers in Wales, which forms a nationallyagreed         career pathway for social workers; (iv) to inform CCW quality assurance         of socialwork degree programmes; (v) to inform the preparation of         child-developmentannotated bibliographies as a resource for educators         and practitioners [C7].
In England, Luckock raised awareness of the SCIE         research findings [R1] in his submission to the House of Commons'         Children, Schools and Families Enquiry into the Training of Children and         Families Social Workers (Para.
14, Seventh Report of Session 2008-09,         Volume 1).
Influencing HE practice: The research led to social workers         feeling better prepared for work with children.
Research was used in two         books on good practice with children: (i) BAAF identified Luckock and         Lefevre's book [R4] as `a core text ...widely used to train social         workers and other professionals' [C8]; (ii) Policy Press records (2013)         show that Lefevre's book [R5] was adopted by 31 BA and MA SWE teachers         in 29 HEIs in England and Wales who were teaching 1,529 students a year         [C9].
Lefevre was consulted on development of The College `Curriculum           Guide on Communication Skills', where her 2010 book is cited as a         core text [C10].
The HEA continue to support development of the impact         of Lefevre's research.
In 2013 they awarded a teaching development grant         to Lefevre to develop and evaluate the learning and assessment of         communication and engagement with children and young people in         final-year social work placements.
Influencing social work practice: Nationally Lefevre receives         more invitations from social-work and non-social-work children's         agencies to contribute to training their staff than she can accommodate.
In 2013, this included an invitation from the British Association of         Osteopaths.
In 2011-12 and 2012-13, the Children and Family Court         Advisory Service commissioned Lefevre to train their practitioners in         London.
This training draws directly on her researcher-practitioner         perspective and leads to improved communication with children by         practitioners.
Practitioners commented on the effect of the         training: `I hope and I believe that I have developed some kind of         attunement, becoming a bit more alert to what children tell me and         finding/developing creative ways in establishing communication with         them'; `It has encouraged me to listen to children on how they         communicate in implicit ways that I failed to pick up previously' [C11].
