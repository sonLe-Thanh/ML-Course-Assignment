     Impact on Industry and Medicine and beyond.
Our research in applied accelerator technologies and particle/target       interactions has been widely welcomed by the industrial and medical       sectors:     As a consequence of our research programmes and our approach to research,       Siemens AG has established a formal collaboration with Huddersfield, and       awarded our International Institute for Accelerator Applications (IIAA)       the status of Siemens Official Technology Partner.
We continue to work       with Siemens on the broader applications of low energy proton accelerators       through two CASE studentships, through contracted research and through our       operation of a &#163;0.5M ion source provided by Siemens to the IIAA on       extended loan.
While much of the work with and for Siemens is covered by       Non-Disclosure Agreements, one example in the public domain is our work on       alleviating the global 99mTc drought by exploring the       feasibility of low energy proton accelerator production of this and       alternative radioisotopes.
We have demonstrated the potential of local       hospital based radioisotope production, and of the deployment of much       shorter lived isotopes for PET and SPECT, and even for cancer therapy,       thereby presenting new industrial routes to the reliable production and       deployment of medical radioisotopes.
Siemens acknowledge that the IIAA       "...is providing an invaluable and recognisable service, informing and         influencing our own internal Research and Development programmes."

Additionally the US company Particle Accelerator Corporation has       collaborated in novel ns-FFAG design.
As a consequence PAC "...has now         established a UK subsidiary of PAC, ie PAC (UK) to be located at the         University of Huddersfield in the 3M Buckley Innovation Centre.
Huddersfield's research programmes will undoubtedly impact future         designs and development of ns-FFAG technology for the benefit of both         industry and society on both sides of the Atlantic..." noting         "...it is important to continue our collaborative work on         next-generation commercial and medical accelerators...".
PAC is       currently "...in the process of licensing our latest innovative         technology with Huddersfield to further our close collaboration,         specifically targeting the need for new, compact sources of         radioisotopes..." [B].
Our research in low energy proton/target interactions for neutron       delivery for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy has been described by       University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust as being "...essential         in shaping our plans for clinical application of BNCT using the         Dynamitron accelerator in Birmingham...".
We are also told "...our         on-going collaboration is critical to our clinical programme..."       [C].
Although the construction of the European Spallation Source (ESS) in       Lund, Sweden has not yet started, our impact on industry is well underway.
As part of the Framework 7 ESS Preparatory Phase Project (ESS-PPP)       Cywinski organised and opened the ESS Industry Day meeting in Copenhagen       in February 2010.
Over 400 pan-European industrialists and politicians       attended to hear about the use of neutrons for materials research, about       how ESS will be built and the facility's impact on society, and       particularly about what neutrons can do for industrial R&amp;D, and the       potential for industrial engagement in the construction of ESS [D].
ESS will be a flagship of European science, comparable in stature to such       international facilities as CERN, ESRF and the Institut Laue Langevin.
It       should be noted that "...the impact of the University of Huddersfield's         research on the ESS project has been significant..." : the ESS-PPP       in which "...Cywinski played a leading and pivotal role, not only         helped to secure the decision to build ESS, but also the decision of         where in Europe it should be built...".
Additionally, "...Seviour         has been a key member of the ESS accelerator design team, influencing         the final configuration of the ESS driver and being a very capable         ambassador for the project..." [E].
Just as our research has influenced the ESS project, we are now       influencing the US DOE's Fermilab future plans for Project X on the other       side of the Atlantic.
Indeed Fermilab recognises that our "...research         may well have implications for the configuration and scope of such         future high power proton accelerators for particle and nuclear         physics..." and that Fermilab has "...benefited from our         collaboration with the University of Huddersfield on the possibility of         developing intense muon sources based on high power proton         accelerators..." [F]     Impact in the Media       The national and international press has shown great interest in our       accelerator projects.
News Focus in Science devoted two pages to EMMA in       2010 whilst the Engineer and Physics World discussed our ns-FFAG research       (in April and May 2011).
In June 2011 The Mail on Sunday colour supplement       featured "This is Emma.
She's going to save the world (and cure cancer)".
The article showed how EMMA has proven the ns-FFAG concept, and is now       being used to help design better accelerators for radiotherapy, future       particle colliders, and for highly reliable powerful proton accelerators       producing neutrons [G].
Correspondingly reports of EMMA went global, with       the accelerator development featuring on Fox News in US, and featured in       Horizons Business on BBC World News with viewing figures approaching 100       million.
In total there are over 32,800 Google hits referencing EMMA       alone.
We have also scripted and produced two broadcast quality and       copyright-free videos describing accelerators and their applications [H].
The first is a 25 minute educational animated documentary film about our       research carried out as part of the CONFORM project.
Presented by       Professor Lord Robert Winston, the film raises public awareness of the       role of particle accelerators in science, technology and medicine, and the       construction of EMMA, at Daresbury Laboratory and covers the history of       accelerators, and ns-FFAG technology and its potential applications in       proton/hadron cancer therapy.
It has been watched approximately 4000 times       on youtube alone and over 1000 DVDs have been distributed to schools, the       press, politicians and the public across Europe.
In the second Sir Patrick Stewart presents an introduction to the       European Spallation Source, explaining that it is a major science facility       that will provide the world's most intense beams of neutrons to study       materials at the atomic level, probing deeply into materials with       unprecedented clarity.
Sir Patrick explains how it will be one of the most       important research facilities in the world, enabling developments in drug       design, magnetic materials for data storage, ceramics for engineering,       biocompatible materials, hydrogen fuel and processes for capturing carbon.
The video is available on line and has been viewed over 32,000 times, and       over 500 DVDs have been distributed to politicians and journalists.
The CONFORM movie was invited to be exhibited at the International       Festival of Popular Science and Educational Films "World of Knowledge" in       St Petersburg, Russia in October 2011, whilst the ESS movie was one of ten       shortlisted for the US National Science Foundation's International Science       and Engineering Visualization Challenge in the same month.
The ESS movie       was also shown and distributed at the ESS Industry Day meeting in       Copenhagen.
The press coverage and the videos have led directly to a remarkable       upsurge in public interest in our research, precipitating many requests       for public lectures, as described below.
Impact through outreach     Members of the group have a long history of activity in outreach and       public engagement with many different audiences and have brought this       experience to enhance the wider impact of this research Activities include       dozens of invited talks to 6th formers in schools; to adults at `Caf&#233;       Sci&#233;ntifique', SciBar, TEDx, and Philosophical Society events, and to       industrial networks such as the Nuclear Institute.
Cywinski and Barlow are       regular speakers, usually to audiences of 50 or more.
The growing       frequency of invitations from networked organisers of these events is       indicative of growing public awareness of and interest in our research.
