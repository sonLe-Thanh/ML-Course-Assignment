     At Ecobuild 2011, the [text removed for publication] Chartered       Institution of Building Services       Engineers (CIBSE) gave a presentation in which he described the UK's       existing building stock as       "the elephant in the room".
Emphasising that there were "no         magic bullets" in meeting CO2       reduction targets, he stressed the need for managing, maintaining and       improving the existing stock       using an honest measurement of actual energy use ("metering; measuring;         monitoring").
The       sentiments sum up the focus and spirit of Tarbase and, as a long-term       supporter of the project, it       was CIBSE [text removed for publication] who suggested that Banfill join       the Publication Working       Group developing the Institution's Technical Memorandum on Low-carbon         Refurbishment of         Buildings (2013).
Banfill was involved in the development of the       Memorandum over a four-year       period and the publication proposes a range of practical solutions to       address the issues highlighted       by his research into Technology Assessment for Radically Improving the       Built Asset Base (see 5.1,       below).
Impact on, and with, CIBSE demonstrates how Tarbase has levered the       support of industry       professionals to drive forward change.
Similar gains have been made at       policy level using a similar,       publication-based pathway, including the Final Report of the Low         Carbon Construction Innovation &amp;         Growth Team published, in Autumn 2010, by the Department for       Business, Innovation and Skills       (BIS) which uses data provided by (Tarbase sponsor) The Carbon Trust, and       states that "members       [of the Team's Buildings Work Group] have agreed that the emphasis         needs to be on measures to         address the existing stock [which has] far greater potential for         reducing its carbon footprint in the         short to medium term" (see 5.2).
The Buildings Work Group involved       [text removed for publication]       Tarbase's non-academic partner, BSRIA, who has confirmed that Tarbase       informed the Group's       deliberations in their work on improving the performance of non-domestic       buildings through       refurbishment.
He has said "I have been impressed with both the         management of the Tarbase work         and the quality of output and I commend the team for their work...
In         particular the analysis of         carbon intensity of electrical supply was helpful in identifying the         urgency of policy in this regard".
(See 5.3).
The pathway to policy-level impact was secured in December 2007 with the       publication of a report       by the independent, industry-led, UK Green Building Council (UK-GBC; see       5.4).
This report,       Carbon Reductions in New Non-Domestic Buildings, was commissioned       by the Department for       Communities and Local Government.
The document makes multiple references       to the research       and to the subsequent application of its modelling techniques by the       Alliance team to three generic       new building types (a &#163;30k package of work referred to as "leading edge"       in the publication).
The       report concluded that "a challenging yet achievable timeframe for         achieving zero carbon new non-domestic         buildings is needed", underpinning the UK Government target of 2019       (announced by       The Labour Party in 2008 and reiterated by the current Coalition       government in December 2010).
For buildings in the domestic sector, we established a consultancy       service, offering advice on       comprehensive CO2 emissions reduction in dwellings.
Aimed at a       range of clients, from individual       homeowners to developers, housing associations and local authorities, it       utilises the domestic       Tarbase model, which is better able to be tailored to the individual       circumstances of a dwelling than       other packages currently available on the market.
As one of twenty new       innovations that "creatively         address the carbon reduction challenge", the service was showcased       at the Innovation Future       Zone at Ecobuild 2010 (London, March 2010), having been selected by a       panel of industry experts       from a competition run by the Modern Built Environment Knowledge Transfer       Network (MBEKTN).
At this event, it attracted interest from both public and private sector       stakeholders, including UK       Future Homes, Fulcrum (now part of the Mott MacDonald Group), Artica       Technologies and       Chapterhouse Architects.
(See 5.5).
Commissions arising out of the consultancy include Energy Modelling in       Traditional Scottish       Houses (EMITSH) for Historic Scotland.
For this &#163;30k commission,       undertaken in 2008, our       researchers modelled and assessed three building variants to establish the       potential for CO2       reductions in traditionally-constructed Scottish dwellings.
The       methodology was also applied to the       refurbishment opportunities afforded by Swedish-style, pre-fabricated       timber houses in Edinburgh,       with the Alliance reporting to the Scottish charity, Changeworks, as part       of the Technology Strategy       Board's `Retrofit for the Future' initiative.
Sub-contracted to Alba       Building Sciences, we assessed       options for the refurbishment of `park homes' (residential mobile homes).
Alba has described our       contribution (worth &#163;23.5k) as being "of substantial benefit" to       them and independent reviewers,       AEA Energy &amp; Environment, reported to funders, OFGEM, that it was "very         thorough" and that "the         theoretical results derived from the TARBASE model accord well with the         savings realised in         practice".
(See 5.6).
One of the most publicly accessible offshoots of Tarbase has been Fromconcrete2cookers,       a       Partnership Public Engagement project led by Carter, with Banfill as Co-I,       funded by the EPSRC.
Launched at the Edinburgh Science Festival in 2009 by [text removed for       publication] the Met       Office's Chief Advisor to Government in Scotland and Northern Ireland, the       project's main output       was a web-based educational game exploring, through character-based play,       how different       measures change energy use and CO2 emissions in schools.
Tarbase constitutes the technical       foundations of the game, which was designed by the eLearning specialist,       Junction-18, in close       collaboration with the academic researchers, teachers and c.100 pupils       from four Edinburgh       schools: Forrester High; Portobello High; Towerbank Primary; and Blackhall       Primary.
Promoted by       STEM Scotland as "exciting and timely", the game has been cited as       "a fantastic resource" by       Education Scotland (formerly Learning Teaching Scotland), which lists the       project as "to be         exemplified".
