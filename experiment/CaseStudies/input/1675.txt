     Key consumers of this research have included senior figures in the police       and judiciary; policy officials and researchers in both spending       departments and the Cabinet Office; the National Audit Office; and       politicians.
Professor Hough has presented his findings more than twenty       times since November 2011 to date.
HMIC, the College of Policing and IPCC       were targeted with early results, and newsprint and broadcast media were       used to publicise the study.
Findings have been presented, by invitation, at the Cabinet Office, and       the Ministry of Justice.
Interest has been further stimulated via the NAO       recommendation in February 2012 (see 5.7) that the House of Commons       Justice Committee and the MoJ should "watch carefully for further         publications" from the team.
An ESRC impact study on the ESS (see 5.6) states that the main pathway to       impact for this work was the researchers' exploitation of a "broad         network of contacts within government and the police service" (pg.
59).
ICPR has interacted with key policy networks since its inception, and       the existence of these dissemination channels and ICPR's track record in       policy-oriented research has facilitated engagement with these       stakeholders.
The ESRC study (5.6) also confirms that the findings from this research       have fed into current policy development in the area of Criminal Justice       Reform (pp.
60-61).
International impact: The ESS trust in justice module       (co-designed by Hough) has been replicated elsewhere &#8212; by academics in the       US, South Africa and Japan, by an EU/UNDP project in Turkey and in Albania       (funded by the Swedish government).
The module was co-designed by Hough.
The work in Japan, Turkey and Albania was led by Hough and Sato.
Contribution to policy making (international): Hough has       disseminated results to senior EU officials via presentations to the       European Network of Councils for the Judiciary; and (several times) to the       Centre for European Studies (CEPS).
CEPS is a policy think-tank providing       research and activities on economic and international policy matters to       the European Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home       Affairs (LIBE).
CEPS specifically invited Hough to address the       implications of the survey results for criminal justice policy.
Contribution to policy making (national): The National       Audit Office (NAO) has kept a watching brief on the project, given its       role of encouraging efficiency, effectiveness and evidence-based       decision-making in government.
The NAO commended this research       (specifically 3.1) advising that it was "interesting from a value for       money perspective", since increasing the legitimacy of the criminal       justice system could contribute to crime reduction.
See 5.7 below.
Stakeholders alerted by Hough to this research include:            Ministry of Justice.
MoJ's Analytical Services team commissioned Hough         et al to combine trust in justice findings (3.1) with data from the         Crime Survey for England and Wales, to produce the report Attitudes           to Sentencing and Trust in Justice, 2013 (5.9).
This aimed to         stimulate policy colleagues in the MoJ to consider how people think         about trust in criminal justice, and included practical policy         suggestions as well such evidence, analysis and explanation of the         relevance of procedural justice theory.
Integrating the two data sets         was informative (as 5.2 can comment) resulting in a better understanding         of how confidence in the judicial system is related to willingness to         co-operate with legal authorities.
The addition of 3.1 findings also         enabled a comparison of the UK with other European countries, resulting         in the conclusion that there was "room for improvement in UK levels of         trust and confidence in the criminal justice system" (pg.
55).
The MoJ         confirm in the ESRC case study of the ESS (5.6) that the findings on         trust in justice have fed into current policy development in the area of         Criminal Justice Reform.
Other government departments.
Hough also formally disseminated the         trust in justice findings 3.1 to Home Office staff, and the then         Minister for Police and Criminal Justice Nick Herbert (via a series of         meetings).
He also presented 3.1 findings to other relevant central         government policy makers at a HM Treasury seminar for policymakers in         October 2012.
HM Inspectorate of Constabulary.
Hough provided advice with respect to         police legitimacy (research published as 3.2 &amp; 3.3) for two reports,         the 2013 review of Stop and Search Powers (specifically on the         methodology and focus of the review, see 5.5); and the 2011 Without           Fear or Favour: A review of police relationships (5.10).
He also         changed HMIC's awareness of how sensitively the public interpreted         everyday police behaviour &#8212; prompting HMIC's realisation that the public         employed a more sensitive radar on these issues than HMIC had previously         assumed.
The ESS findings also led directly to two recommendations from         the then Chief Inspector of Constabulary &#8212;that training courses for         officers should include "appropriate input in relation to integrity and         anti-corruption" (pg.
62, 5.10) Without Fear or Favour); and         that a single accessible code of ethics should replace what he felt was         a fragmented set of aspirations, a recommendation that he was successful         in getting the College of Policing to adopt (see 5.1).
Practitioners in the College of Policing, the Metropolitan Police         Service and other police forces.
Hough disseminated the findings 3.1         through informal briefings and discussion.
Greater London Authority.
Hough organised a round-table in November         2012 at the Office of the Deputy Mayor for London for Policing and Crime         at which he briefed the Deputy Mayor on this research; and subsequently         gave evidence to the Greater London Authority Police and Crime         Committee.
Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).
Its 2012 report         "Corruption in the Police Service in England &amp; Wales" cited 3.1 (pp.
13-14) and the research helped inform the IPCC's views on how unethical         police behaviour impacts on public trust and legitimacy.
IPCC also used         the findings from 3.1 to support its own findings that corruption was         not endemic in UK police forces.
(See 5.4).
Contribution to shaping attitudes and debate:       ICPR have briefed various politicians, including Nick Clegg, Nick Herbert       (when Police Minister at the Home Office) and Stephen Greenhalgh (Deputy       Mayor of London) on Trust in Justice findings, as well as Sir John Thomas,       the Lord Chief Justice.
ICPR has also engaged various other intermediaries including NGOs and the       media to promote this research, and these intermediaries have in their       turn influenced policy.
Specific examples include:            Howard League: Hough used the Trust in Justice findings in a February         2013 pamphlet he co-authored for the Howard League Intelligent             Justice: Balancing the effects of community sentences and             custody (5.8) which argued that it is usually more effective         &#8212; and more economic &#8212; to get people to `buy into' behaviour rather than         compel or cajole or supervise them into it.
Fiducia: a research partnership of several European universities and         public policy institutes.
Fiducia's programme draws heavily on Trust in         Justice data, for its objective to promote trust-based policy to policy         makers, governments, academics, judges and lawyers across Europe.
Media: Trust in justice findings have been discussed in BBC Radio Four         programmes "Start the Week" and in a three-part documentary "What are         the Police For?"
in 2012.
Hough also discussed the findings in a Guardian         article "Why the police must secure public trust" December 2011, which         received 122 comments, evidence that it stimulated lively debate.
