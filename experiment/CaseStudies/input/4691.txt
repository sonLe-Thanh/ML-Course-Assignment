     There are 10,500 care proceedings annually concerning around 18,000       children in England and Wales.
In 2011, the average length of proceedings       was over 55 weeks.
Responses to problems identified in the research have       reduced this to 37 weeks, with a plan to complete proceedings within 26       weeks.
The findings from the research have directly impacted in three       ways: on the Family Justice Review, as well as the design and       implementation of the 2013 reforms to care proceedings which will reduce       their cost and duration; through changes in local authority       pre-proceedings practice; and on the better collation of statistics       concerning care proceedings by court administrative staff.
Family Justice Review and the reform of care proceedings     The findings on the wide variations in case duration between courts [5]       and [2], the impact this has on costs [3], the role played by lawyers in       progressing cases and the barriers to effective judicial case management       [6] and [4] made it clear why previous attempts to reduce case duration       through directives to judges were ineffective.
Rather, more substantial       changes were necessary so that judges were fully familiar with the cases       they were expected to manage.
The President of the Family Division and the       Judicial College are undertaking work to improve case management on the       basis of this research (and within the context of longstanding and acute       concern about costs and delays in care proceedings: [a](i) and [f]).
Masson's research was used extensively in the Family Justice Review       Interim Report ([a](i)).
For example, it relied on [5] and [2] for its       account of the excessive use of experts in care proceedings ([a](i): pp       109-110).
Throughout the Family Justice Review Final Report, key messages       from the body of Masson's research provided the empirical basis for many       of the Review's recommendations to support case management (training,       judicial continuity and management of judges) and the need for engagement       with service users ([a](ii)).
These reforms are being implemented;       legislation has been introduced to curtail the use of experts &#8212; the use of       experts and the length of proceedings are already reducing, for the       benefit of children who will have more timely decisions about their       future, local authorities and the tax payer.
A subsequent Parliamentary       Select Committee, designed in part to provide democratic overview of the       proposals in the Interim Review, employed Masson as its specialist adviser       ([b]) and her research formed the underpinning for much of the discussion       in that report, providing, for example, corroboration of the anecdotal       views of judges and others who gave evidence to the committee ([b]: paras       247 &amp; 263).
Masson was invited to give a seminar to the civil servants supporting the       Family Justice Review team, to speak to the Review about care proceedings       and case management, asked to review draft proposals and research       undertaken for the Review.
In addition to the specific references to the       research, the Review also referred to evidence given by Masson and others       which relied on the first two studies, including the Family Justice       Council and the Council of Circuit Judges.
For example, findings from [6]       and [4] formed the basis both for the framing of issues of case management       ([a](ii): paras 3.54-7) and the recommendations (eg para 3.83; 3.96), as a       result of which Sir Nicholas Wall publicly announced the creation of a       Family Business Authority ([d]: para 20 [referring to Masson's research]       and accepting that, as Masson suggested, the fundamental problems are       cultural, para 30); Masson's Consultation Response highlighted the need       for better service user engagement by courts and the Review agreed with       Masson's important comment that better data and research could improve       public understanding of family justice ([a.
](ii): para 2.105); Masson       shared the preliminary results from [1] with the review ([a](ii): para       3.108) and the Review recommended that their use should be revisited in       the light of Masson's research (para 3.110).
Masson's research on legal       representation was cited by the President of the Family Division as `nailing         three particular canards about solicitors who undertake publicly funded         Children Act work' ([f]: para 42) and concerns highlighted by Masson       about the best practitioners leaving the field were accepted by the       Justice Select Committee ([g]: para 44).
Findings of [1] were first shared with The President of the Family       Division and Ryder J (who was responsible for the Family Justice       Modernisation Programme) in June 2012.
Pre-proceedings work is given far       greater emphasis in the 2013 reforms.
The President has identified local       authority pre-proceedings work as `vital', noting that `it can         divert a case along the route which avoids the need for care proceedings',       the evidence for this is Masson's research ([h]).
All judges who hear care       proceedings have been provided with a summary of Masson's findings by the       Judicial College ([e]).
Changes to local authority pre-proceedings practice     The pre-proceedings research [1] identified the effectiveness of the       process for pre-birth planning, importance of close monitoring of cases in       pre-proceedings to avoid drift, and drawing the court's attention to the       work undertaken.
Local authorities have made such changes as a result of       the research: this has been endorsed in a good practice guide for social       workers ([i]) and RiP, the organisation providing national training on the       care proceedings reforms has filmed a lecture by Masson and Dickens on       pre-proceedings work, for use in training social workers.
Judicial Statistics     The findings in the care profiling study [5] and [2] that Final Hearings       were routinely booked at the start of cases for 3 or 5 days, but were       frequently much shorter, led to new instructions to courts in the "Public       Law Outline" (a court Practice Direction) in April 2008 about listing       final hearings.
There was evidence that later listing did unblock court       time tables ([j]).
The identification during the fieldwork of wide scale       mis-entry of cases into the county court database, which is used for the Judicial         Statistics, led to a review and a change of method to reduce the       problem of double counting ([c]).
The published statistics are now more       reliable ([b]).
