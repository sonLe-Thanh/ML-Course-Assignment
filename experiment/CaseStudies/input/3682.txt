     SMEs have traditionally found it difficult to access universities and       research.
Working between October 2010 and October 2012 with IPP, a       company that specialises in process cleaning for the oil and gas industry,       the KTP project brought to the organisation resources which it otherwise       would not have been able to access, including a KTP Associate and two       academics.
The underpinning research on integrated information systems provided       research insights in terms of best practice and informed the company on       issues which may have led to prior failures.
Examples included: a culture       which encouraged individualism at the expense of the company, inefficient       business processes and islands of technology that in some cases were not       being used but were costing the company money.
The project addressed these       issues and delivered in two key areas: (a) improvements in business       process management and (b) implementation of a strategic management       information system.
Inpipe's Business Development Manager stated in the       final KTP report to the TSB: "The KTP project has exceeded         expectations...
The support of the university staff has been invaluable         in achieving the outcomes....Culturally we are a more open, transparent         organization in terms of decision-making."

The original aim of the IPP KTP was to redesign the business processes       and information systems in order to provide strategic management       information to support future growth and development within IPP.
Following       this redesign, the company would purchase an enterprise resource planning       system (ERP) and the academics would lead on its implementation.
However,       early on in the project the company began to experience serious financial       challenges due to the global recession.
Throughout this period the       academics and company continued to work together but cash flow issues in       IPP prevented the company from purchasing an ERP and the project plan had       to be amended.
The result was the development of a bespoke integrated       system enabling data flows from order, through to design and then       production; increased participation of key stakeholders; and training and       development of staff in the new business processes and computerised       system.
Improvements in Business Process Management     Waring, together with the academic supervisor and KTP associate conducted       a major analysis of the processes ranging from customer enquiry through to       design, production and despatch.
The new system delivered the following       impacts (Source 1):            &#163;60,000 per annum saving through removing duplication of effort         leading to a 25% reduction in sales staff achieved through natural         wastage.
This allowed for recruitment of three additional staff, one         each in marketing, production and quality management.
&#163;24,000 per annum saving on an expired software lease in the design         department.
&#163;9,000 per annum saving on licence fees for unneeded IT support         package.
Implementation of a Strategic Management Information System     By extensive and detailed modelling of products' dimensions, volumes, raw       material costs and profit margins, the team worked on developing accurate       business information, particularly around the company's most significant       export product range; foam pigs and bi-directional pigs (pigs are products       that are used to remove detritus from building up on the inside of oil and       gas pipelines).
This delivered the following impacts (Source 1):            Embedding of knowledge within IPP through the employment of the KTP         Associate and the training and development of a number of their staff.
Time for processing sales of the bi-directional(Bi-di) pigs has been         reduced by 50%.
Implementation of improved processes and systematic working with         standardised product information and engineering drawing packs reducing         processing time for the foam pigs from five hours to 15 minutes,         representing a saving of &#163;118.75 per order without loss of quality.
Reduction in errors by 14%.
For the bi-di pigs alone, this is a saving         of &#163;146,106 worth of (previously) rejected products each year.
This is a         direct result of improvements to processes and information flows,         validation and accessibility of information, and rejected products at         inspection stage.
Associated improvement in delivery times: In June 2012, 71% of the         bi-di pig orders were delivered late.
By September 2012, this was down         to 40%.
This reduced financial penalties related to late order         deliveries, saving &#163;3,240 per year          In addition to the above, the project team have left the company with a       bespoke strategic decision support system which facilitates real time       integration of data from customer order to design and production as well       as producing management information reports to support the strategic       operations of the company.
This is now in operation within IPP.
The Regional KTP advisor stated at a regional KTP event held at       Northumbria University on 13 September, 2013: "The support given to         Inpipe Products by Teresa Waring and the academic supervisor... in         extremely difficult company circumstances over the two years that the         KTP ran was exceptional.
The experience of these individuals in terms of         their research and ability to work with company partners through the         vehicle of a KTP has impacted on the company by delivering bespoke         integration of systems and has helped to underpin growth in sales.
They         have also helped improve organizational culture, quality and remove         wastage that may not have been discovered without the KTP."
(Source       2).
The company KTP supervisor (the Business Development Manager), who       herself had been a former KTP Associate, was very positive about the       impact KTPs have on organisations and their value in helping to improve       the productivity of SMEs: "My experience of KTPs as an associate and         as a company supervisor within IPP has been fantastic.
Working with the         Northumbria team on this project has allowed me to use their expertise         and research knowledge to take the company forward in terms of increased         sales, reduction in re-work and waste and to facilitate a change in         company culture.
I will be able to take the knowledge I have gained into         other similar projects in other companies."
(Source 4).
The impacts from this project have also been transferred into the NHS:       "We have conducted research with Teresa Waring and colleagues and it         has helped us greatly.
We have not had a great track record in         implementing new systems or realising the benefits from them.
The         approach that has been taken on the bed management project has brought         to light many issues and has made us aware of the impact of action         research and academic theory.
The new system rolled out onto the medical         wards was a great success and we have rolled it out onto the surgical         wards.
To date the research project has saved the Trust &#163;400,000 through         our management of patient flow and not needing to open a `winter         overflow ward' from December 2012 to February 2013."
