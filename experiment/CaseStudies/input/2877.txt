     Road Traffic Collisions are the biggest cause of death amongst young       people in the developed       world.
Behavioural (i.e.
human) factors are thought to contribute to 95%       of all collisions (Sabey,       http://www.roadsafetygb.org.uk/news/2722.html).
ARU research on road-user behaviour was one       of the biggest strands of work commissioned by the DfT specifically to       inform the development of       government policy on road safety, with 14 contracts running from 1988-2009a.
The in-depth studies       of police files1-3 focused on specific types of collision       (overtaking, junction collisions) and the       practical implications were spread over a wide range of potential       collision sites, vehicle design       issues, and policies for education and enforcement.
The findings were       passed on to safety       researchers and research managers at the DfT, whose job it was to brief       policy makers and       ministers on the implications of those findings.
For shaping public knowledge of road hazards, this research has helped       develop the Hazard       Perception Test (an important part of the Theory Test for new drivers) as       well as the policy on       night-time training and testing of new driversa.
This was       achieved through direct contacts with       policy-makers through invited talks for 17 out of 18 annual 'research       seminars' organised by DfT.
These talks were also published as DfT research papers (e.g.
DfT Annual       Seminars 12, 17, 18 and       DfT research reports 18 (Young drivers), 58 (Work-related traffic       accidents) 54, 85 &amp; 121       (Motorcyclists), 92 (Speed), 95 (Driver Distraction), 110 (Fatigue) and       112 (Public Attitudes)b       ensuring that the research findings were reaching a wider audience.
Of       these reports, ARU       research relating to Driver Distraction6, Motorcyclist Safety4,5       and Work-related Road Traffic       Accidents3, had the greatest impact as detailed below.
Impact of Driver Distraction and Road-Side Advertising on         International Policy Changes       As outlined above, the ARU identified some of the key dangers associated       with low-level roadside       advertising6 and this research has also been cited widely in       influential international policy and       research reports across the US and Australasia.
The ARU's work has       influenced policy changes as       seen in documents from:            US Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administrationc        Austroads (the association of Australian and New Zealand road         transport and traffic authorities         comprising the six Australian state and two territory road transport and         traffic authorities, the         Department of Infrastructure and Transport, the Australian Local         Government Association and         the New Zealand Transport Agency) and Transport and Road Safety (TARS)         of New South         Walesd           Impact of Factors affecting Motorcycle Collisions and International         Policy Changes       Despite making up only 1% of road traffic, motorcyclists account for a       hugely disproportionate 21%       of deaths on the road (DfT Road Casualty Statistics).
Research at       University of Nottingham into       factors affecting motorcycle accidents1,2 has been extremely       influential worldwide, feeding into road       safety reports for            Victorian Parliamentary Road Safety Committee Inquiry into Motorcycle         Safety (Australia)e        The French Institute of Science and Technology for transport, spatial         planning, development         and networks (IFSTTAR) for the French Department of Ecology and Energyf        European Science Foundation COST Action (257) on Accident Prevention         Options with         Motorcycle Helmetsg           Impact of national launch of the `Named Rider' Campaign on awareness         of Motorcycle         accidents in the UK       In order to translate the findings of factors relating to motorcycle       accidents to the public, the DfT       launched a radio and television road safety campaign in the UK &#8212; the THINK       Biker!
`Named Rider'       campaign.
On the basis of research conducted by the ARU the DfT invited       Crundall to act in an       advisory role and to act as the scientific spokesperson for the campaignh.
The campaign was       disseminated into local information leaflets for the public citing       Nottingham research on risk factors       for collisions4,i The DfT praised Nottingham researchers for       the success of this campaign in       preventing deaths and accidents by their unique contribution in       understanding the psychology       behind failing to see other drivers.
According to the THINK!
Team Head from the Department for Transport: `Our         analysis of         motorcycle safety in the UK in 2009 showed that `looked but failed to         see' crashes involving cars         and motorcycles continue to cause a considerable number of deaths and         accidents.
Previous         THINK!
campaigns have tackled the issue of visibility by encouraging         drivers to take longer to look         for bikes.
This time, we sought a greater understanding of the issue by         looking at the psychology         behind how and why we see some objects but not others.
Your work         introduced us to the idea of         cognitive conspicuity and helped us to develop a campaign that aims to         change the way drivers         think about motorcyclists in order to improve their chances of seeing         them on the roads'h.
According to a 2010 DfT report on the Think!
`Named Rider' campaign:       "We saw evidence that the `Named Rider' campaign had the potential to       change behaviour, with       the proportion of people agreeing that they `always look out for       motorcyclists' increasing       significantly (from 84% to 91%).
"j       "THINK!
shaped ... road safety since 2000.
It estimates that every pound       spent on advertising       delivers a saving of round &#163;9.36.
Over the past decade, we estimate that       up to 3,912 lives have       been saved by the THINK!
campaign.
We are confident that Named Riders is       more than playing its       part.
"j     Impact of Work-related Traffic Accidents on Worldwide Policy Changes       The in-depth study commissioned by the DfT into work-related road traffic       accidentsb was cited as       evidence in European policy making documents including:            European Commission SafetyNetk (a European Road Safety         Observatory) which supports all         aspects of road and vehicle safety policy development at European and         national levels       European Transport Safety Councill Reducing Road Safety         Risk Driving for Work and To Work         in the EU.
