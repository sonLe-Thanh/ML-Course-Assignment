     Impact on cultural life: enriching public appreciation, understanding         and imagination.
Both productions revealed and demonstrated the aesthetic and       presentational possibilities of the       hybridisation of devised performance, dramatic stage practices and media;       and &#8212; in the       combination of contentious site and ground-breaking production &#8212; the       opportunity to offer original       artistic and intellectual experiences to contemporary audiences in a       theatrically sophisticated       manner [5.1] Both productions sold out, though audiences were       inevitably limited by the       restricted nature of their sites: The Persians: 8 x 120       spectators; Coriolan/us: 8 x 350 spectators.
They were extensively previewed &#8212; including BBC Radio 4 Front Row       (11 August 2010)[5.2] &#8212;       and enthusiastically reviewed, in the Welsh and UK press.
The Persians       was included in The         Daily Telegraph's list of ten best UK productions of 2010 [5.3];       and Coriolan/us as one of the ten       best UK productions of 2012 in The Observer (15 December 2012) &#8212;       `...National Theatre Wales's       galvanic Coriolan/us' [5.4].
`This [The Persians]       is extraordinary, one of the most imaginative,       powerful and haunting theatrical events of the year.'
(The Telegraph,       13 August 2010) [5.3].
`...a       production [The Persians] that is both minimalist and massive in       its scope and marvellous in its       realisation' (Hereford Times, 13 August 2010)[5.5].
`The       National Theatre of Wales turned       Aeschylus's anti-war tragedy into one of the most thrilling events of the       year by staging it in an       army village high in the Brecon Beacons where soldiers are trained to       fight in built-up areas.
The       result was sinister, ghostly and dramatically stunning.'
`The best British       drama of 2010', (The         Telegraph, 16 December 2010)[5.6].
`Unlike Hamlet, he       [Coriolanus] has little time to think.
But       once again, Pearson and Brookes have given us occasion to.'
(The         Telegraph, 10 August       2012)[5.7].Audience responses were solicited by questionnaire (The         Persians); and informally via       the NTW on-line community.
Examples of quote: `First class imaginative       staging of an apparently       alien play in alien surroundings so produced and acted as to show its       passion and relevance for       today' [5.8].
`After watching professional theatre for over 50       years, I was...starting to get       tired...the theatrical creativity, acting, direction, organisation and       technical competence in this       production...was simply amazing' [5.9]     Impact on the policy and practices of National Theatre Wales.
NTW is a Welsh Assembly Government initiative; in `Rapid Response' (New         Welsh Review 85,       Autumn 2009 [5.10], the artistic director outlined his vision,       intimating that the first 12-month       programme would focus on a `theatrical mapping' of the country: `We will       explore the land through       theatre, and the theatre through the land.
Each piece will be developed       out of, and in response to,       its location.'
The successful fulfilment of this ambition in the       dramaturgical form and siting of The         Persians demonstrated the potential and feasibility of site-specific       work within NTW's portfolio of       presentational practices, as a means to address diverse audiences with       challenging, innovative       and participatory forms of theatre.
The production played an important       role in assisting the       organization achieve its launch year goals: providing a platform and       context for a new national       theatre to demonstrate its ability to mount work &#8212; geographically       dispersed, disparate in nature and       of international standard; and helping the nascent organisation establish       its viability and credibility       [5.11].
It also enhanced the status of NTW's skill at successfully       negotiating with a major public       institution, the British Army.
Located in a replica village constructed to       enable the Army to train in       urban warfare, The Persians required extended and detailed       negotiations and practical       collaboration with Defence Estates and its agency Landmark to address and       settle complex site       management issues: the planning, scheduling and implementation of       scenographic construction;       the organisation and execution of effective public access; and the       successful realisation of       rehearsals and performances in extreme circumstances, through the       provision of access to existing       infrastructures and resources.
During final rehearsals, performers and       crew lived in Army barracks       in Sennybridge and ate in the mess.
The Persians was staged in an isolated, rural location and was       produced by NTW in partnership       with Theatr Brycheiniog, Brecon.
It demonstrated that work of high       standard can be created at site       with the participation of local organisations and operatives, both       professional and amateur: it       involved ten volunteer stewards from the local area for each performance,       contacted through       existing infrastructures and via the NTW on-line community.
It       necessitated the detailed planning       and implementation of procedures for the processing, marshalling and       transportation of audiences.
`It is this ability to negotiate partnerships with seemingly intractable       establishments, as well as       gain the trust and support from local communities, that has helped the       company establish itself.'
(South East Wales, 18 January 2011).
As a direct result of the success of The Persians, Pearson,       Brookes and Banham were invited to       create a site-specific version of Coriolan/us as NTW's major       contribution to the World       Shakespeare Festival/London 2012 [5.12], with a total production       budget of &#163;200,000 from public       funding.
It was produced in collaboration with the Royal Shakespeare       Company (RSC) and       staged in a large hanger at RAF St Athan in South Wales.
The invitation       demonstrates the impact       of The Persians upon the programming policy of of the Royal       Shakespeare Company and London       2012, in demonstrating the potential and viability of innovative       approaches to production within       institutional contexts.
Such has been the significance of impact on policy that Coriolan/us       has been scheduled for future       restaging in Stratford and in London; and NTW has recently commenced       discussions with Pearson       and Brookes to conceive a third production &#8212; a version of Christopher       Logue's account of The Iliad       [5.11].
This will further extend the reach of the production       procedures developed in The Persians       and Coriolan/us &#8212; conceived from the outset in a form imminently       suitable for restaging, and in       anticipation of international co-production.
Impact on professional theatre practice.
Pearson, Brookes and Banham have been acknowledged for their work through       a number       of professional awards:     * Brookes and Banham received the Theatre Management Association's `Best       Design 2010' for       The Persians [5.13]; and Kaite O'Reilly received the `Ted       Hughes Award for New Work in Poetry       2010' for the commissioned script, created in consultation with Pearson.
[5.14]     * Coriolan/us received the Theatre Critics of Wales Awards 2013       for `Best Production', `Best Actor',       and `Best Music and Sound'.
[5.15]     * The design for Coriolan/us was selected for exhibition at World       Stage Design 2013 (limited to 100       physical exhibits from all those submitted) at the Royal Welsh College of       Music and Drama,       Cardiff in May 2013.
[5.16]     These awards make two significant acknowledgements: first, that high       quality, publicly engaged       approaches to the conceptualisation and realisation of performance can       emerge from an       academic research context; secondly, that research-driven, innovative       theatre practices &#8212; once       confined to the realm of the theatrical fringe &#8212; can have significant       critical and popular appeal       when enacted within NTW.
NTW here as a supportive and sympathetic realm of       production       expertise; and institutional framework dedicated to public engagement,       significantly through the       extended use of social media [5.17].
The casting of The Persians and Coriolan/us was achieved       through audition, resulting in a hybrid       mix of Welsh and Wales-based actors from both mainstream and experimental       backgrounds, and       offering new professional opportunities and challenges, particularly with       the inclusion of media,       and in immersive relationships with audiences.
And they augmented       employability by including not       only young trainee directors &#8212; the trainee on The Persians almost       immediately secured the post of       Associate Director at Sherman Cymru, Cardiff supported by a reference from       Pearson &#8212; but also       students from the main Welsh conservatoire for professional training &#8212; the       Royal Welsh College of       Music and Drama &#8212; as both scenographic assistants to Banham, and as       stand-ins for absent       actors during rehearsals [5.16]
