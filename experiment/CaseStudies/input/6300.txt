     Development of typefaces for global software applications     The research carried out by the University of Reading enables major       software developers and publishers to support non-Latin scripts in their       products, in a linguistically, historically and typographically correct       manner.
The typefaces to which the research team has contributed its       expertise appear in standard operating systems and key applications and       are embedded resources in software used worldwide.
The research has       brought quality to the default forms of letters that readers see everyday       and has enabled local communities to preserve and extend use of their       written language in a globalised environment.
Examples include the following:             Microsoft Windows main interface typefaces (2007-present):         Leonidas contributed to the development of the Greek Segoe and Office         ClearType typefaces, while Ross contributed to the development of the         Nirmala typefaces for Indian languages.
Lead Program Manager for Fonts         and Typography at Microsoft, has described their work as having         `significant positive impact on the quality of fonts we provide for         international customers'.
Adobe application typefaces (2011): Ross's family of Devanagari         OpenType typefaces (developed in collaboration with Timothy Holloway and         John Hudson) is included within Adobe's primary layout applications, and         other key applications are in the process of adding it.
The Senior         Manager, Type Development, at Adobe, says: `We consider Ross and         Leonidas to be the leading experts in their respective fields and they         are two of the most crucial advisors for Adobe's type development work.
Their guidance has helped Adobe develop fonts that are among the world's         most useful for the Indian language and for Greek.
Without their ongoing         assistance, I would be worried about our ability to properly address the         unique challenges of these languages'.
Mobile phone operators (2008): Ross's consultancy has fed into         the design of Indian scripts and Thai in the Nokia Pure typeface and the         global extensions of Vodafone's corporate typeface (both projects with         type designers Dalton Maag).
Other non-Latin typefaces in global use: During the REF period,         several MA research projects, developed with the research team's input,         were the foundation for successful commercial typefaces; for example,         Skolar Pan-European in Typekit (Brezina, 2011), and Nassim Arabic         (Nemeth, 2011), the latter used for the BBC's Arabic, Farsi and Pushtu         websites.
Development of typefaces for previously unsupported script usage in         publishing     Influential publishers have drawn directly on the Department's expertise,       to support innovation in their language support and improve the quality of       their typography.
The application of the research team's methods and       expertise to new non-Latin typeface design equips the typographic design       community with a choice of high-quality fonts &#8212; something which was       previously lacking.
Examples include the following:            The Adobe Text/ Brevier In 2010 Leonidas was consultant on         development of full polytonic (ancient/church/literary) Greek characters         and monotonic (modern) characters, with innovations such as accented         small caps.
The work developed a research theme, started in 1998, with         Greek variants of Adobe's Minion Pro (2000), Garamond Premier Pro (2005)         and Arno Pro (2007).
The repertoire of these typefaces greatly extends         that of their predecessors (Times and Porson), which were suited to         purely academic texts, but limited in general use.
Cambridge University Press's Greek-English Lexicon uses Arno         Lexicon, a specialised modification of Arno Pro, for which Leonidas         designed the diacritics (which are especially important for learners of         Greek) and modified and redrew other characters to ensure readability in         complex typography at small sizes.
Dutch academic publisher, Brill In 2012 Leonidas was consultant         on the design of Greek typefaces for Brill's on-line and print book and         journal catalogue, including design for specialist archaic and obsolete         characters used by researchers in transcription of archival material.
Anandabazar Patrika, the largest newspaper group and publishing         house in West Bengal, commissioned Ross (2012), who led a team of         specialist designers, to design Sakar, the first fully operational         Bengali OpenType typeface to overcome the problems of presenting a         connecting script in narrow columns.
Type design that contributes to preservation of endangered scripts     The Department's research methods have had impact on communities where a       script may be endangered, threatening the survival of languages that use       it.
During the REF period De Baerdemaeker's investigation into Tibetan       typefaces in his MA and PhD research at Reading (supervised by Ross)       resulted in development of Lungta, a Tibetan-Latin typeface design, which       is now used by University of Chicago Press and Oxford         University Press (USA).
Dissemination of research-based methods to practitioners     The Department's research is recognised as having changed the discourse       about non-Latin typeface design among professionals as well as       researchers.
Dissemination has taken place in the following ways:             Collaboration with other professionals on specific projects,         extending the research team's expertise to others.
This process was         formalised in the REF period by the Knowledge Transfer Project (KTP) for         Monotype Typography (2008-10) on the use of documentation to recover         understanding of historic scripts.
The KTP associate is now a senior         employee at Monotype.
Invitations to run workshops and exhibit at leading conferences         for type designers and manufacturers.
The Department's invited         exhibitions for Association Typographique Internationale (ATypI,         typically 400 attendees) in Iceland (2010) and Hong Kong (2012) were         followed by further invitations to exhibit at the Indian Institute of         Technology, Guwahati, and at the Granshan conference, Bangkok (March and         July 2013).
The reach of these exhibitions has been extended through         publication of a collection of essays (for the Hong Kong exhibition),         which has sold over 350 copies.
Workshop attendees have taken the         researchers' methods into the design studios or software departments of         their employers (Apple, Adobe, Microsoft, Monotype and Dalton Maag).
British Council workshop The second edition of Ross's book, The           Printed Bengali Character, was launched at a type design workshop         given by Ross and De Baerdemaeker (2009), reported in the largest         circulating (1.28 million) Bengali daily newspaper, Anandabazar           Patrika, and followed by an AHRC/British Library-funded workshop         at the University Library, Kolkata (Ross, 2011).
