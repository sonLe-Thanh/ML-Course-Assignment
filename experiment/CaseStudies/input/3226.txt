     Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in the UK, many countries       in Europe, North America, and Australasia.
The disease is a leading cause       of cancer-related death in the western world.
Dr. Barratt's development of novel criteria for diagnosing prostate       cancer from computer modelling of needle biopsy has been of benefit to       clinicians, men suspected of having prostate cancer, and men already       diagnosed with the disease who require a comprehensive assessment of the       extent and type of their disease prior to treatment.
As a result of this       research, clinicians now have access to clinical tools for       implementing and validating MR-directed prostate biopsy as well as tools       for accurately classifying patient risk and determining viable treatment       options [a,b].
Patients directly benefit from this research       through the significant improvement in accuracy of needle biopsy         investigations, which in turn provides greater confidence when         deciding between different treatment options [a,b].
Development and adoption of clinical tools: From 2007       onwards, Barratt's collaboration with clinicians at University College       Hospital (UCH) led to new clinical criteria for image-directed biopsy       using computer modelling of this procedure.
For transperineal,       template-guided biopsy mapping, these criteria were quickly adopted         into clinical practice at UCH and from September 2009, applied to all         patients undergoing this procedure, whether or not the patient was a       volunteer within a clinical trial [b].
The criteria were also incorporated       within an intuitive and easy-to- understand clinical classification         scheme that also includes histological information on the       aggressiveness of disease, measured by the so-called Gleason Grade.
This       scheme, commonly known as the "Traffic Light Scheme" and developed by       clinicians in collaboration with Dr Barratt's team, provides a highly       visual way of documenting patient risk by using a colour-coded system that       is easily recognisable to patients.
It has been found to be particularly       useful during patient consultations as a means of allowing the patient to       see where the burden of disease is and to make an informed choice,       together with the clinician, about which treatment option to pursue [a,b].
Since its introduction as part of the routine clinical protocol at UCH in       2009, the Traffic Light scheme for classifying prostate cancer risk has determined         the treatment options offered to more than 741 men with the disease       who underwent a template-guided biopsy mapping before 31 July 2013 [b].
This includes men treated under the NHS and privately both outside and       inside ongoing clinical trials; the results of this test are often used to       determine eligibility for clinical trials.
The scheme is also used as part       of the protocol of a major 3-year NHS/NIHR-sponsored Health Technology       Assessment trial, the PROMISE trial, which began recruiting in 2012 and       currently includes four centres in the UK.
The aim of this study is to       evaluate the clinical efficacy of MR in the diagnosis and characterisation       of prostate cancer in a hospital setting in England and Wales.
The trial       has recruited 50 patients so far.
The scheme was adopted by 15 centres in the UK and internationally         between 2008 and 31 July 2013, including The Royal Marsden, St.       Mary's (London), Bristol, Basingstoke and the Whittington Hospital, with       plans for it to be introduced into all nine hospitals in the London Cancer       Network by 2014.
In Europe, the scheme is now used in hospitals in Zurich       and Lausanne in Switzerland.
The current estimate of the total number of       patients whose treatment has been determined by this scheme is in excess       of 1,200.
As a further indication of the impact of this research on medical       practice, a recent review of prostate cancer diagnosis [c], published in       the influential British Medical Journal, also recommends that new       biomarkers should be validated against the thresholds employed in this       scheme, citing [output 4, above].
It is also anticipated that the scheme       will be included as part of the national guidelines issued by the         Royal College of Pathologists, which is currently under development       and is due to be published in 2014 [b].
Patient benefits: The MR-directed biopsy outlined above       enables biopsy sampling that is sufficiently accurate for tumours to be       targeted selectively.
In this approach, tissue samples are collected only       from regions that appear to be tumours in the MR images, which makes the procedure         more efficient, more accurate, less invasive (and therefore posing a         lower risk of infection), and cheaper compared with established biopsy         techniques.
Clinical trials: The image registration software that       implements the techniques described in Section 2 is being used for       targeted biopsy and therapy as part of two clinical trials.
In one trial,       the surgical value of using this software in an initial series of 24       patients was analysed [d].
The results indicate that the use of the       software to determine precisely where an MRI-visible tumour is located       within ultrasound images obtained during the high-intensity focused       ultrasound (HIFU) therapy led to a change in the surgical plan,         determined using the standard clinical method, in half of the patients.
In these patients, the size of the treated region was increased to       ensure that the tumour was fully ablated.
Clinical follow-up data are not       yet available, but the longer-term impact of employing this technology is       that the treatment is more effective than it would have been if       performed using standard clinical methods in a substantial proportion of       patients.
To date, in fifty patients who went on to be treated using minimally       invasive, MR-directed therapy within a clinical trial and as a result of       criteria, the therapy was delivered using the image registration       technology developed in this research [a].
The clinical experience with       these patients is being used as evidence of clinical safety and efficacy       as part of a submission for CE marking a commercial medical device that       incorporates this technology.
