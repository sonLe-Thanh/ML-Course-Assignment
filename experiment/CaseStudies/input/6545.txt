     Aspects of the body of empirical work on task-based language learning and     teaching, as laid     out in section 3 above, formed the basis of in-service training sessions     during 2012-2013 for     language teachers in four language schools, and also two sessions with     trainee teachers at the     University of Kingston.
The seven 90 minute sessions were based on a     description of selected     findings, followed by discussion with the audience of the potential     pedagogical implications and     how they could be applied to the practical teaching situation these people     worked in or would     be working in.
While research articles in second language acquisition tend to report       findings and then suggest       pedagogical implications and applications, this is done without engaging       in direct dialogue with       practitioners.
The sessions described here were therefore somewhat unusual       &#8212; and arguably       much more impactful &#8212; in engaging in direct dialogue with the research       `consumers' and       taking into account their views of the practical possibilities of altering       pedagogic practice in line       with the research evidence.
Details of the beneficiaries &#8212; Each of the seven sessions was       delivered to between 15 and       20 people.
They were either highly experienced practising teachers of       English as a Foreign       Language at the British Study Centres (BSC) in London, Brighton, and       Bournemouth, at the       Richmond Adult and Community College (RACC) or else were trainee teachers       on the       Kingston University MA programme in Teaching English to Speakers of Other       Languages       (TESOL).
Details of the nature of the impact &#8212; The ultimate nature of the       impact would be a long-term       alteration in the teaching practice of these teachers, brought about by an       understanding of the       research and seeing how their professional practice could benefit from it.
This is being       assessed through the planned follow-up sessions through 2013-2014.
A more       quickly realised       impact and one that could be gauged after the sessions through a       questionnaire, is an altered       view of the possibilities of classroom tasks, and a determination to       design their class activities       in the light of the discussions in the training sessions.
Evidence or indicators of the extent of the impact.
At the end of       each session, feedback       sheets were given to each participant for them to record how useful they       found them, and the       extent to which they will adjust their teaching practice in the light of       what they have learned.
There are 67 available for scrutiny.
All comments were positive about the       usefulness of the       sessions.
Most reported that they would use the insights in their       practice, though very small       minority expressed caution about how they could incorporate the research       into their daily       working lives.
Typical comments are exemplified by the following       quotations:     Very thought-provoking, thank you.
The session will affect the choice and level of tasks I give to         students.
It will definitely make me think more carefully about the tasks I         select.
I will be more aware in future of picture sequencing.
I will use this information to more accurately target lesson aims.
I have a clearer understanding of how the design of a task impacts on         the complexity,         accuracy and fluency of non-native English.
I will definitely remember to give planning time before every task.
I will definitely give more consideration to designing tasks.
I will be more selective in choosing materials for a given task,         knowing the implications they         have on learner performance.
I will definitely use the various pictures to focus on different types         of output (...) and develop         my own accordingly.
I understand better what impacts on different levels of performance.
I will definitely use tighter structures if I want to focus on         accuracy.
I intend to test the data presented here, and am encouraged to focus         on colloquial and         idiomatic English in class.
I'll use picture sequences more often in class.
I have been invited back by all these organisations to give further       sessions, and intend to       establish a long-term agreement to give research-based talks on a regular       basis.
As laid out in       section 3 of this form, there is a lot of research that could be drawn on.
