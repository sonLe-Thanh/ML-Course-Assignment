     Context     The University of Leeds first licensed intellectual property (IP) arising       from the referenced research to Industrial Tomography Systems (ITS) in       2004, patent [PCT/GB/01/05636] underpinning a conductive ring sensor, one       of ITS's multiphase pipe sensor options [A], still sold by ITS.
The       Company (originally called Optomo PLC) has continued to license IP from       Leeds and also drawn on the research by consulting with the University       since 2001 [B].
Impact on ITS       According to the Managing Director of ITS: "Overall, Leeds           insights have helped ITS create a world-class product portfolio       ,since 2008 we have developed and launched five innovative           products with the active support of research projects at         Leeds:" [A]     - p2+, is ITS's core electrical resistance tomography system,       superseding the p2000, and was launched in 2009 with a user interface and       software design based on collaborative research conducted at Leeds.
[A]     - m3c, is ITS's core electrical capacitance tomography system       launched in 2009, superseding the m3000 with an advanced user interface.
[A]     - The additional functionality and user-friendly software interface of       the p2+ and m3c are "a major step forward in the industry".
[A]     - SCG, image reconstruction algorithm launched in 2008 based on       software codes licensed from Leeds in 2008.
The algorithm reconstructs raw       ERT data to provide more advanced and higher resolution images.
[A]     - z8000, a high performance two phase flow meter launched in 2008       based on software codes licensed from Leeds in the same year.
This       instrument's 1000 frame per second measurement capability is "ground         breaking" [A].
-v5r, a new system and variant of z8000, launched in June 2013       based on electrical resistance tomography with IP licensed from Leeds in       2011.
The v5r enables fast measurements of flow properties (up to 500       frames per second) and was designed for use in high conductivity       environments (e.g.
salt water) opening up the oil and gas sector.
[A]     Sales of these products, which totalled &#163;5m between year ending       March 2008 and year ending March 2013, "are in large part"       responsible for the growth in ITS sales and employment of         approximately 60% over the same period.
[A]     Exports have increased by 67% since January 2008 enabling ITS to       sell into more than 15 countries.
[A]     Impact on users       During the eligible period the five new products "have helped open up         a significant number of new applications in existing and new sectors,         attracting new customers."
[A] For example:     - Biotechnology - Pfizer, Genzyme     - Chemicals - Du Pont (bulk), Johnson Matthey Catalysts (speciality)     - Environmental - Van Ord (precision land forming and dredging control)     - Fast-moving consumer goods - Unilever, P&amp;G     - Food - Danone     - Mining - CSIRO (separation processes);     - Nuclear - National Nuclear Laboratory, Sellafield, CEA, Parsons, Energy       Solutions     - Oil &amp; gas - Statoil (oilfield flows), Petronas Technical University       (UTP)     - Pharmaceuticals - GSK (product monitoring and control)     The extent to which specific users of ITS systems have benefited is       regarded by the customers of ITS as strictly proprietary information.
However, indicative examples of impact on users have been made available       by ITS [A], for example:     - improving manufacturing efficiency and speeding up product development       in pharmaceutical research and development;     - reducing waste in food manufacture by more accurately measuring mixing       of products;     - improving manufacturing efficiency of auto-catalysts across 5 global       manufacturing businesses;     - enhancing safety of nuclear waste processing in North America by       providing experimental basis for validating process scale-up; and     - gaining valuable insight into what is happening inside vessels to       ensure optimum catalyst performance     Further opportunities and new applications are continuing to open up on       the global marketplace, with one example being an installation where the       instrument will be used in work relating to copper mining tailings.
The       user stating he was impressed with the instrument's ability "...to         measure concentration distributions in dense mixtures of more than one         phase, non-invasively, and without having to use equipment that utilises         nuclear-based technology".
