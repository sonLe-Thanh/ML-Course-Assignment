     The Oxford University Botanic Garden is the oldest botanic garden in the       UK and a major tourist attraction in the city, with over 100,000 visitors       from all over the world every year (ranked 16th of 92 tourist       attractions in Oxford on TripAdvisor, July 2013).
The research link       between the UOA and the Botanic Garden goes back more than 100 years       including the work of Sir Robert Robinson (who pioneered the isolation and       study of bioactive compounds from plants in the early 20th       Century); the Chemistry at the Garden public project has taken inspiration       from this historical link and built on it to provide a public engagement       project with contemporary relevance.
The series of collaborative outreach projects started in 2011,       International Year of Chemistry, when an enthusiastic group of staff and       research students from the Chemistry Department hosted a poster exhibition       at the Garden.
The posters told stories about the chemistry of       plant-derived compounds, with titles such as "Poisonous plants: an       unlikely source of medicine!
", "History molecules; plants and       archaeology", "When life gives you lemons...take some Miraculin", "Natural       Solar Fuels".
The exhibition was in a prominent location near the entrance       to the Garden and there were over 14,000 visitors to the garden during the       four-month exhibition (as recorded by ticket sales) [7].
The launch event       for the exhibition was attended by the Lord Mayor of Oxford and other       local councillors, as well as senior representatives from industry,       business and the University.
Comments from the Exhibition's visitors' book       included: "Fascinating information and communicated in a simple style         for us non-chemists.
Brilliant!
"; "A very interesting exhibition         and well presented.
Found lots of information on plants found in my         garden."
[8]     From September 2012, highlights of this exhibition were developed into an       ongoing Chemistry Discovery Audio Trail, which includes Anderson, Vincent,       Parkin and McCullagh talking about aspects of their research described in       Section 2.
Acting on some of the feedback from the poster exhibition, each       audio feature, delivered via an interactive map of the Garden, is       accompanied by a chemical structure model of the compound being described.
Over 400 visitors and 200 post-16 students and teachers have so far taken       the trail [9] and there have been at least 1,700 downloads of the trail       audio podcasts from iTunesU and the University of Oxford podcast page [9].
A video about the project is publicly available, featuring extracts from       the chemistry audio trail and researchers talking about how highly they       value the opportunity to engage with new audiences.
The trail reaches an       audience that might otherwise not engage with research of this kind, as       evidenced by comments such as a 2012 review on TripAdvisor: "The         Chemistry trail &#8212; an audio system that accompanies you [on your         visit] &#8212; ... gives some fascinating insights into the plants and why         they are significant."
[10].
After a visit with his class a       secondary school teacher commented "Very interesting chemical stories         told by real scientists.
Excellent to see the molecular models next to         the plants" [11].
A molecular model on the audio trail          The next development was to introduce more face-to-face contact between       academics and the general public.
During May to July 2013, academics from       the Chemistry Department (Davies, Anderson, Vincent, Sartbaeva and Cooper)       delivered a series of guided walks around the Botanic Garden, using plants       to explain key aspects of their research as in Section 2.
Over 50       individuals attended the talks, and the intimate setting meant visitors       were able to engage with the chemists in ways that had meaningful impact       on their perception of science.
Detailed written feedback was collected       from all attendees, with one example stating "I feel that what I have         picked up "in small bits" has helped me read the science sections of         public media in a more informed way."
[12]     One of the major themes from the Chemistry at the Garden project was       selected for an interactive stand at the prestigious one-week Royal       Society Summer Science Exhibition in July 2013.
The topic, "Solving the       Energy Crisis &#8212; from Ancient to Future Solar Fuels", linked directly to       Armstrong and Parkin's research on artificial photosynthesis (see Section       2).
During the week-long exhibition over 30 volunteers from the Department       and the Botanic Garden, led by Rhiannon Evans (PDRA in the Armstrong       group), worked on the stand.
Always led by a member of the solar fuels       research group, the exhibition received over 12,500 visitors, including       11,400 from the media, schools and the general public (official figures       from the RS).
The Oxford Chemistry team spoke directly with at least 3,000       visitors, measured by handing out stickers to everyone who engaged with       the stand over the course of the week.
The team also engaged online       through social media, podcasts, the RSSE website (which received 83,000       unique visitors over the course of the exhibition), and the blog, where       aspiring scientists posted results from a take-home chlorophyll experiment       after visiting the exhibit, continuing after July 2013 [13].
The       popularity of the stand was enhanced by a `hands-on' approach with       interactive demonstrations and experiments completed by hundreds of       people.
The activities linked to several aspects of primary and secondary       school Science, Maths and Geography curricula and A-level Biology and       Chemistry curricula.
The strong impact of the exhibition on school pupils       and their teachers was evidenced by requests for follow-up resource packs       which were delivered to 84 UK schools, the majority of which had never       been in contact with the Department of Chemistry before [13].
Since the       exhibition the Department has been approached directly by students asking       for further information about solar fuels science, including one Year 13       student at North London Collegiate School who wrote "I was fascinated         by your display at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition, and I         believe others at my school would love to hear about your work too.
We         would be delighted if you would be able to talk to us about 'Ancient to         Future Solar Fuels'."
[14].
A Chemistry Department volunteer engaging with school students at the RSSE      The Department raised over &#163; 30,000 in sponsorship for the RSSE stand.
One of the sponsors, the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), gave support       for the Future Solar Fuels stand since the focus aligned with their own       programme of activities, in particular the goal of raising public and       political awareness of the environmental and economic potential of fuels       produced using sunlight, as well as with the strength of UK research in       this area.
The RSC provided both funding and relevant materials for       distribution, taking advantage of the stall as a `channel to a wider       audience', and welcoming the fact that the UOA planned to `create a legacy       from the stand' and promote future solar fuels beyond the RSSE.
The RSC       also valued the involvement of practising researchers on the stand, as       well as the collaboration with the University of York researchers [15].
Finally, this sustained series of engagement beyond academia has       established links with the outreach ambitions of industry.
Since 2011,       industry sponsors have included BP, Syngenta, Johnson Matthey, Infineum,       AZ, Evotech, GSK, Basildon Chemicals and the Society of Chemical Industry       (SCI), plus the donation of equipment by Locktronics/Matrix.
Syngenta and       SCI both sponsored the event because they saw its value in informing and       enthusing the general public about the society benefits of plant chemistry       [16, 17].
BP's Chief of Staff stated: "The summer exhibition is a         great way to engage current and future scientists and the general public         and to raise awareness of science in general.
Your exhibition on         `Solving the Energy Crisis  From Ancient to Future Solar Fuels' will be         an interesting and informative example."
[18] The generous donations       in support of the project have provided sustainability &#8212; the RSSE exhibit       will be taken to the 2014 Big Bang Fair (estimated 60k visitors).
