     The impact of Leicester research has brought this trade-off to the       attention of policy-makers at several central banks who are now better       informed about the nature of costs associated with this trade off.
Such       information has assisted them when deciding upon where on the trade-off       they might wish to locate their policy choices.
This research has been presented at the annual conferences of the       International Finance and Banking Society (IFABS).
These conferences are       attended by central bank economists and academics and central banks from       emerging countries.
The conferences are attended by 300 delegates each of       which a minimum of 45 economists from 14 country central banks, European       Central Bank, US Federal Reserve Banks, Federal Reserve Board, African       Development Bank, BIS, IMF and World Bank.
IFABS was established in 2008 by Duygun Fethi and Shaban and has       continued to be led by them.
IFABS aims to provide a discussion forum for       policy makers and academics to address issues relevant to the global       financial crisis.
The extension of this research (using the same model)       was also presented at a research symposium organized by Banco do Brazil       during August 2011.
The symposium was attended by 40 delegates from       different central banks and economists worldwide.
The reach of the impact       extends to policy makers in many emerging economies.
We know that       policy-makers in Indonesia and Turkey have acknowledged the impact of this       research in their policy choices.
Impact on Indonesian State-owned Banks     Duygun Fethi and Shaban were officially invited during July 2012 by the       Supreme Audit Board (BPK) in Jakarta Indonesia to present their research       findings to a group of 80 executive bankers and bankers from four       state-owned banks, Bank Indonesia (BI), and Supreme Audit Board of       Indonesia (BPK).
The BPK is responsible for auditing more than 600       state-owned entities in different economic sectors, with around 6000       employees operating in Jakarta and other provinces.
One of the economic       sectors that PBK audits, is the banking sector, particularly state-owned       banks, which comprise the four largest commercial banks in Indonesia.
Dr       Bahrullah Akbar, the BPK Board Member whose departmental responsibility is       to oversee the state-owned banking sector in Indonesia, stated that "Dr         Duygun Fethi's research has been extremely influential in shaping the         BPK's policy stance with respect to setting the capitalization ratio for         Indonesian banks including those of the four state owned banks".
As a result of the presentation in Jakarta and three subsequent visits of       BPK officials to Leicester, the BPK has found the model useful in shaping       their recapitalization policies, and hence, the BPK brought the model to       the attention of executives from four state-owned banks who were not       familiar with the costs of recapitalization:            Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI).
The largest bank in Indonesia, the         seventh largest bank in Asia, with 9,000 branches, 100,000 employees and         30 million customers.
Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI), which has 1,000 branches, and 9 million         customers.
PT Bank Tabungan Negara       Bank Mandiri, which is the second largest bank in Indonesia, with         1,733 branches.
Fethi and Shabaan were also invited to speak at a conference organized by       the Supreme Audit Board of Indonesia in Jakarta in October 2013.
In       September 2013, the researchers had reached an agreement with the BPK to       provide capacity building for the bankers and auditors with a seminar and       a training course in Leicester in November 2013.
This aimed to bring the       model to the attention of a wider audience.
Impact on Turkish banking sector     Fethi and Shabaan were invited to present their research at a symposium       organised by the Central Bank of Turkey in December 2011.
The symposium       was attended by a group of 90 delegates of which 40 were from the Central       Bank of Turkey, the Treasury and from Turkish banks.
The research was published in a special issue of a journal that was       associated with this meeting.
Dr Ahmet Faruk Aysan, a board member of the       Central Bank of Turkey commented that "The findings of your research         are highly significant for us at the Central Bank of Turkey.
They have         been extremely useful in familiarising us to understand the impact of         regulating banks' capital on banks' productivity and its consequences on         the economy overall.
In the light of your model, our discussions at the         Bank led us to use reduced rates of recapitalization".
They were       invited to a further Central Bank of Turkey event to discuss their work in       November 2013.
As evidenced in the letters provided by the officials at the central       banks in emerging economies, the significance of this research is that:            It challenges popular post financial crisis policy responses in         emerging economies       It invites policy makers to take a wider perspective on their policy         design       It modifies policy-makers' expectations about the consequences of the         implementation of their policies.
Dr Akbar of BPK elucidates the significance of ULSM research on their       policy design, as follows:     "Prior to the work of Drs Duygun Fethi and Shaban the setting of the         capitalization ratios would not have taken into consideration the         macroeconomic costs that bank capitalization impose.
Our policy         discussions have taken these costs into account and have resulted in         lower ratios than otherwise would have been the case.
It is our strong         expectation that significant social welfare benefits will flow from         these decisions in the form of lower levels of unemployment and hence         higher per capita disposable incomes".
