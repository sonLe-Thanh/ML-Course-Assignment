     Since 2008 Hawking has created several books and TV series that bring the       new developments in physics and cosmology arising from his research since       2003 on information loss, the no boundary condition, and the inflationary       universe to a general audience.
They provide access to ideas whose       sophistication would normally preclude coverage in the mainstream media.
Hawking places research in a wider cultural context.
This deepens public       understanding of research in physics and cosmology, produces widespread       media interest, and reiterates the worth of these fields to society.
Books:     Building on the phenomenal success of A Brief History of Time       with over 10 million copies in print, in more than 45 languages &#8212; the       follow-up volume A Briefer History of Time explaining the no       boundary proposal [3] has sold 580,000 copies since 2008.
The book The         Universe in A Nutshell describing cosmological aspects of the no         boundary condition and black holes has sold 823,000 copies since       2008.The Grand Design, co-authored with Leonard Mlodinow, has sold       1.43 million copies since publication in 2010 (all data supplied by Random       House [8]).
In The Grand Design, the authors discuss       Hawking's own research since 2003 on cosmology, particularly the       no-boundary proposal [3] and its implications for inflation and initial       conditions for the expanding universe [2,3].
A selection of the many       national and international press reactions can be seen from reports in The         New York Times (20/09/2010) [15] and the BBC News       (02/11/2010) [16].
Hawking also co-authored two books for young children with his daughter       Lucy Hawking: George's Cosmic Treasure Hunt (Corgi 2009, sales       75,692) and George and the Big Bang (Corgi 2011, sales 27,185).
These titles completed a trilogy of children's books begun in 2007 with George's         Secret Key to the Universe (sales 176,220).
Sales figures provided       by Transworld Publishers [11].
These books introduce children aged 8       upwards to physics and cosmology, harnessing their fascination with the       universe, space travel and alien life, as well as the search for the       frontiers of knowledge.
They introduce science through engaging adventure       stories and communicate what motivates scientists in their quest to       understand the universe.
TV series:     Hawking also participated in high-profile TV series about his research       and on cosmology and physics more generally.
These programmes had high       impact, as can be seen from the viewing figures [9] (which will continue       to grow dramatically when the series are reshown or dubbed into foreign       languages and released in DVD format).
The fact that such programmes are       commissioned and broadcast also provides evidence of the very considerable       impact that Hawking's previous work has had upon the world of the media       and the general public.
Most recently, Hawking's major TV impacts have       occurred through the series Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking       (2010, Discovery Channel), Genius of Britain (2010,Channel 4 had       901,400 viewers for the 5th programme in the series, which       featured Hawking), Brave New World with Stephen Hawking (2011,       Channel 4, four-programme series had 892,100 viewers), Stephen         Hawking's Grand Design (2012, Discovery Channel 4, the 3 episodes       had in total 3.14 million viewers, Into the Universe with Stephen         Hawking (2010-11, Discovery Channel, the 6 episodes had in total 5.9       million viewers), and Stephen Hawking: Master of the Universe       (2008, Channel 4, the 4 programmes had a total of 1,399,900 viewers       [9]).These last three series encourage the public to explore cosmology and       physics.
Each series draws on Hawking's recent research, including eternal       inflation (refs [2, 5]) and the no-boundary proposal in the context of the       string theory landscape (ref [3]).
A film entitled Hawking, directed by Stephen Finnegan, has been       made by Vertigo Films in collaboration with PBS/Channel 4 (duration 89       mins) and was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, 15th -26th       May, 2013 and the Edinburgh Film Festival 19-30 June 2013 [13].
Its UK       Gala Premiere is at the Cambridge Film Festival on 19 September 2013       (Hawking will also open the Film Festival) [13].
It will be released in       cinemas across the UK on 20 September 2013 and shown by Channel 4 later in       2013.
Paralympic Opening:     Hawking's impact as one of the best-known scientists in the world was       notably demonstrated when he was chosen for the role of narrator for the       2012 Paralympics Opening Ceremony watched by a peak of 11.2 million UK       viewers (and many more overseas) [14 ].
This was the largest ever Channel       4 audience.
While championing the cause of those living and competing in       the Games despite disabilities, Hawking urges his listeners to believe       there are no boundaries to human endeavour, In his narration Hawking       mentions explicitly his cosmological research on the no boundary condition       for the universe: "There ought to be something very special about the       boundary conditions of the Universe, and what can be more special than       that there is no boundary?"
[10].
Anthony Faiola for the The Washington       Post (29 August 2012) reported: `London raises curtain on Paralympic         Games "With an ode to science, human perseverance and the disabled       physicist Stephen Hawking ...
Performers with disabilities soared in the       air on zip lines as Hawking, arguably the globe's most celebrated living       scientist, used his trademark voice box to deliver a metaphorical message:       "Look up at the stars, and not down at your feet.
"[12]' In recognition of       the enormous impact of his work, in 2009 Stephen Hawking was awarded the       Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honour, by       President Obama.
The citation states [7]:     'Persistent in his pursuit of knowledge, Stephen Hawking has unlocked         new pathways of discovery and inspired people around the world.
He has         dedicated his life to exploring the fundamental laws that govern the         universe, and he has contributed to some of the greatest scientific         discoveries of our time.
His work has stirred the imagination of experts         and lay persons alike.
Living with a disability and possessing an         uncommon ease of spirit, Stephen Hawking's attitude and achievements         inspire hope, intellectual curiosity, and respect for the tremendous         power of science.'
