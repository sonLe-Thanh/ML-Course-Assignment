     The research impacted on the work of the African and Indian organisations       delivering sports-for-development projects and the work of the funding and       sponsoring bodies in the UK (IDS, Comic Relief and UK Sport).
African and Indian organisations     The study provided the organisations under investigation with a       monitoring and evaluation framework and associated tools that strengthened       their programmes of activity.
This framework is set out in Coalter (2006)       and is available for download via the sportanddev.org website, which is an       international repository for work in this field.
By adopting more robust       systems of monitoring and evaluation, for which they received training and       support, the organisations became more capable of assessing the quality       and impact of their work.
It also led to the strengthening of the design       of their programmes, and the setting of appropriate outcomes.
It has also       led to improvement in other areas as noted by IDS/UK Sport and Comic       Relief as they explained that "although challenging for some of the         partners, others have taken the monitoring and evaluation skills         acquired through the process into other areas of their work."
The research allowed project workers to assess the impact of their work       on children and young people more thoroughly, which enabled them to amend       or adjust their programmes to further improve their outcomes.
Subsequently, several of the organisations involved in the research have       appointed workers with responsibility for monitoring and evaluating of       programmes.
Some of the organisations have continued to develop monitoring and       evaluation programmes.
For example, Magic Bus continues to expand its       monitoring and evaluation function and is currently supporting others in       the sector through further training opportunities based on the training       the organisation received through this project.
In December 2011 it       delivered a three day workshop in `M&amp;E and Project Cycle Management of       S4D Programmes', designed to help delegates to understand and prepare       M&amp;E frameworks, enhance programme design and management and understand       logic models.
Funding and Sponsoring Bodies in the UK     The research resulted in changes in the way that IDS supports partners       and how it approaches research.
In its summary document about the study,       IDS stated:     "IDS has refined its strategy towards developing and initiating research       projects and continues to aspire to be an all round `better partner'.
The impact study findings have alerted us to the importance of       re-evaluating traditional assumptions about the nature and extent of       expected impacts and the definition and measurement of success.
We will       support our partners to evaluate their interventions focusing on accurate       beneficiary targeting, better understanding participant needs and the       wider context."
(IDS, 2010, p23)     This was re-iterated by the International Programme Manager, IDS/UK Sport       when she said that "For IDS and UK Sport, it has informed our advice         to partners on programme design and our programme strategy going         forward."
This was further emphasised by IDS/UK Sport and Comic Relief as they       explained that: "As a result of this project, our own understanding of         the role of sport has progressed immensely.
It has informed our own         programmes and will continue to do so in the future."
The study has also helped raise Comic Relief's awareness of the       importance of monitoring and evaluation:     "We acknowledge the need to support organisations to take the time to       develop and fully understand their theory of change to allow for better       setting and monitoring of outcomes for children and young people.
We will       assess the relevance of the `deficit model' across other programme areas       and continue to challenge organisations in their assumptions about the       groups they are working with and the issues they are addressing through       their programmes We will support further learning and exchange between the       sport for development and wider development sectors, so that organisations       can learn from each other's good practice and understanding about how       change is brought about."
(IDS, 2010, p24)     The Sport for Change Manager for Comic Relief also explained how the       research "has helped guide the design of our Sport for Change strategy         and the assessment of proposals."
