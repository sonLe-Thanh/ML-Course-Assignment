     As a crucial element of modern biocatalysis, biocatalysis enzyme panels       are being increasingly       developed for integration into safe, green, more selective and cost       effective processes for the       synthesis of various compounds, including chiral chemicals.
Through       Nzomics, Northumbria       researchers have now worked with over 20 clients (15 since 2008) providing       a range of       biocatalysis enzymes for processes in the pharmaceutical, fine chemical,       food and biofuels       sectors.
Since 2008, Nzomics has offered fee-for-service contract research       services totalling       approximately &#163;200,000 for a range of clients including GlaxoSmithKline       and Almac Sciences, in       the pharmaceutical sector; Glycoform, Prozomix, Hycagen, Protech Research,       Sepagen and       Micron Bio-systems, in the biotechnology sector; and Kraft Foods in the       food sector.
Additionally,       Nzomics has entered into research and licence agreements with Almac       (2009-present), Prozomix       (2009-present) and Megazyme International (2003-present): these companies       sell enzymes       developed by Nzomics to a worldwide market.
In 2009, Nzomics entered into two six-year collaboration and licence       agreements with Almac to       provide recombinant DNA clones to the company for the production of two of       their selectAZyme&#8482;       Enzyme Panels, the Carbonyl Reductase (CRED) Enzyme Screening Panel and       the Nitrile       Manipulator (NM) Enzyme Screening Panel.
The CRED panel is now the largest       of the enzyme       panels sold by Almac and was developed solely with Nzomics.
CRED and NM       sales since 2009       are as follows: 27 CRED panels and the bulk purchase of 17 individual       CREDs (corresponding to       approx.
&#163;250,000 of sales) and 13 NM panels (corresponding to approx.
&#163;30,000 of sales).
Development and sale of these panels has resulted in the significant       expansion of Almac's       Biocatalysis team.
The sales are mainly to pharmaceutical and fine       chemical companies and the       enzymes are used in the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients       (intermediates in drug       synthesis).
Almac have confirmed that work with Nzomics "has resulted         in useful commercial         opportunities for Almac from medicinal chemistry scaffold supply to         actual building block supply at         scale across a range of industrial disciplines".
Nzomics have provided services to GSK since 2009, supplying valued       materials, such as enzyme       panels and cloned genes.
GSK states that this "has allowed us to         attempt some novel enzyme-catalysed         chemistry or to explore a scientific hypothesis relating to the         synthesis of specific         molecules of interest, and all have been incorporated into our general         pool of enzymatic tools".
Indeed, GSK emphasise that "Nzomics' fee-for-service business model         works ideally for our         industry" and "This has therefore been a highly productive and         valued relationship for us."
In 2009, Nzomics also entered into a collaboration and licence agreement       with Prozomix to provide       recombinant DNA clones for the production of several research enzymes.
So       far this has resulted       in approximately &#163;20,000 of sales, to academia, biotechnology, fine       chemical and pharmaceutical       companies.
The collaboration with Prozomix also includes two EPSRC funded       CASE studentships,       one completed and one just starting.
The student associated with the       completed studentship       became an employee of Prozomix in May 2012.
In regard to its Ketoreductase       Enzyme Panel       flagship product, Prozomix confirms that, "without the underpinning         research from Nzomics, with         respect to deciphering which of the many discrete protein families are         most relevant to our         customers, our product would almost certainly not be recognised as         having the highest hit rate of         all similar kits available globally".
Moreover, Prozomics state that       "Nzomic researchers have a         unique ability to identify, target and rapidly progress key areas of         emerging biocatalysis enzyme         technology, and then to disseminate those findings with great overall         commercial effect" and that         this "has, and we hope will continue to, support new product development         within Prozomix".
These activities demonstrate that the research expertise of Professor       Black, Dr Dover, Dr Perry       and Dr Zhang in enzyme characterisation and improvement has significantly       benefited UK industry       (from SME level to `big Pharma') through the provision of novel reagents       and products which have       had valuable impacts on their business success.
