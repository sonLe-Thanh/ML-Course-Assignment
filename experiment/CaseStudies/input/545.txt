     The research activity described above provides the basis for changing       perceptions of classical Indian and contemporary dance, cultured bodies,       and identities through performance, educational activities and mentoring       projects with young people and emerging artists - engaging with up to       30,000 people across the UK and internationally each year - generating       impacts with both reach and significance.
Contexts and Routes for Impact:            GCSE/GCE examination       In 2009, Faultline became a key work on the AQA GCSE Dance         syllabus and, since 2008, Jeyasingh has been a set practitioner for         study on the OCR A-Level Performance Studies syllabus.
Jeyasingh has         assisted the understanding of Faultline as a key work through         the generation of educational resources, delivery of workshops and         creation of video materials (see ResCen, Creating Character: http://www.rescen.net/Shobana_Jeyasingh/character.html#.Un7D6I2vySU.
Through 2009-2013 the company delivered 135 workshops for students         studying company repertoire, for 2323 students; 8 Teacher Training and         INSET days, for 95 teachers.
The company has sold 1082 DVDs; and 9354         resource packs.
Further resources are produced and sold commercially in         collaboration with ArtsPool (CDRom/ poster and revision cards http://www.arts-           pool.co.uk).
Resource guides include texts by Hodder Education         publishers: AQA GCSE Dance Teacher's Guide with DVD-ROM + CD         (2009) by Howard and Percival and OCR Performance Studies for A           Level, (2008) by Pymm, Deal and Lewinski.
Plus, The Dancing           Times published a GCSE study aid on Faultline by Sanders         (2010, 100/1199).
Education workshops and a flagship project at Mulberry School for           Girls       Jeyasingh undertakes needs-based workshops with school-age groups based         on her choreographic practice.
She aims at allowing students a space in         which they can explore and embody identities that reflect their lives         and the urban spaces in which they live.
At Mulberry School in         Whitechapel, in 2012, Jeyasingh worked with 300 students using         Kalarippayattu workshops, and with 12 students for a site-specific         project that was attended by 120 students.
She worked with 13 students         for a curtain raiser project performed at the Royal Opera House.
In         2013, she undertook an artist residency there, where the company worked         with 24 students.
As a girls school, with an almost exclusively Bengali         Muslim student population, the students say that they find Jeyasingh -         an Asian woman, with an independent and successful dance company, who         works with both Asian and contemporary dance styles, without feeling the         need to label components of her work - an inspiring role model.
In a         three-day residency the company used contemporary choreographic and         creative methods to rehearse and perform a five-minute work in the         school's new theatre space.
The head teacher finds Jeyasingh's         contribution unique, saying that in the difficult days of low arts         funding, Jeyasingh makes time and finds funds to work with young women         at the school who have a love for dancing, but who don't always find         parental support for their dance ambitions.
She says that young people         are `global citizens' and face unique challenges for defining their         identities, and Jeyasingh's work has taken on this challenge and         produces globally-aware work that instinctively understands modern         identity.
Jeyasingh's patience in working with the students, her ways of         empowering them, her lack of interest in labels such as Asian, British,         traditional, modern allow the girls to explore hybrid identities, and         gain confidence in their bodies.
For her school work with girls,         Jeyasingh often gets students to use work with strength and power as         motifs.
Mentoring       Jeyasingh regularly undertakes facilitation and mentoring roles in         contexts that enable her to challenge artists to reconsider cultural         definitions through embodied work.
Recent mentoring projects include:           Collolab workshop, East London Dance agency (2010), Choreogata,         Southbank (2011), Choreographic Collisions, Venice biennale         (2012), Back to the Lab - Breakin' Convention, Sadler's           Wells (2013).
The latter of these projects brings Jeyasingh's particular interest in         the choreography of the urban to the fore.
Back to the Lab         attracts dance makers with no formal training, as is typical of street/         hip hop based dance.
In 2013, Jeyasingh mentored four emerging hip-hop         choreographers, and facilitated their translation of a street dance         style, that is made up of multiple dance/music styles and histories, on         to a theatrical stage.
Each of these choreographers worked with five         dancers and produced a ten-minute dance piece, based on the two-week         training and mentoring with Jeyasingh.
180 audience members watched         these works-in-progress, one of which was in May 2013, performed at the         Breakin' Convention and attracted 1600 audience members.
Public engagement       Besides dance work and workshops, Jeyasingh is actively involved in         public engagement activities, including forums, paper presentations, and         TV and radio talks.
In 2012, Jeyasingh presented a paper `Looking for         the Invisible: The Abstract in South Asian Arts,' at Akademi.
In 2011,         she delivered a key note at Trinity Laban for a symposium called         Passion, Pathways and Potential in Dance; delivered lectures to MA         students at the London School of Speech and Drama and the University of         Sheffield.
In 2010, her process was filmed and broadcast on the national         TV channel in India, Doordarshan.
In the same year, she presented talks         at Dansenshus, Stockholm; contributed to a post-show talk about Indian         choreographer Chandralekha at the South Bank Center; presented papers at         Max Mueller Bhavan, Delhi, at the NCA in Mumbai and The State of the         Arts conference in London, and workshops at The Bangalore School of         Music in Bangalore and Gati Festival in Delhi.
Within each of these         contexts audiences/participants reflect upon and question attitudes and         perceptions of cultural difference and tradition.
Professional dance practice       The Artistic Director of Dance Umbrella says that Jeyasingh has an         enormous impact on the dance profession, by creating new audiences, and         by experimenting with classical South Asian forms.
She has produced         enormously influential work that challenges conceptions of tradition and         modernity, self and other, East and West.
In addition, she was the first         choreographer to successfully make work that extended the boundaries of         a classical form.
In many international projects, like an EU-funded         commission to make site-specific work, a tour of India, a collaborative         exchange between UK and China artists in Danscross 2009, Jeyasingh is         chosen to represent UK choreographers.
In addition, her work often         challenges gender definitions, and produces a feminist reengagement with         historically patriarchal sites.
