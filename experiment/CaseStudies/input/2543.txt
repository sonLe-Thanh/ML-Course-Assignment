     ESYTC has had an impact in two main ways:     a.
Providing the evidence base for the Scottish Government's reforms         to youth justice and thereby supporting reductions in offending     The findings on the effectiveness of policing and youth-justice       interventions (McAra and McVie 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4) formed the evidence       base for the Scottish Government's recent reforms to youth justice,       including the Early and Effective Intervention Programme for under 16s and       the Whole System Approach for under 18s.
The Whole System Approach, in       particular, was developed to deal with high-risk young people involved in       offending and represents a major shift away from punitive measures towards       maximum use of diversion, a key focus being to keep 16 and 17 year-olds       out of the criminal justice system.
The Whole System Approach has been       promulgated by the Scottish Government as "an effective way of working"       because it is underpinned by the ESYTC evidence that intensive       system-contact can have detrimental consequences for offending behaviour       and longer-term life chances (5.5).
The Early and Effective Intervention Programme has now been rolled out       nationally.
The Whole System Approach was piloted by Northern Community       Justice Authority in 2010 and, on the basis of positive early evaluation,       was rolled out nationally to all 32 Local Authorities in September 2011,       along with guidance that draws heavily on ESYTC findings.
All but two       Local Authorities in Scotland are currently signed up to adopting the WSA       (5.4).
These measures resulted in major and significant reductions in offence       referrals to the Scottish juvenile justice system.
According to Daniel       Kleinberg, Ex-Head of Youth Justice in Scottish Government:     The following statistics are evidence of some of the success seen in       action on the insights contained within the Edinburgh Study &#8212;            Nationally, since 2007/8 offence referrals to the children's reporter         have fallen by 66%, from 16, 490 to 5,604 in 2011/12, with a 31%         reduction from 2010/11 to 2011/12.
Since 2008-9 the Policing Performance Framework has collected data on         youth crime: the number of recorded crimes and offences committed by         children and young people (8-17 year olds) decreased by 32% between         2008-09 and 2011-12.
The number of children and young people (8-17) who         committed crimes and offences decreased by 9% between 2010-11 and         2011-12.
(5.2)          The longer-term implications have been confirmed by Kenny MacAskill,       Cabinet Secretary for Justice: `The work they [McAra and McVie] have done       on the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime has been important       in providing the underpinning evidence for the approach this Government       has taken to youth justice issues.
The more we resort to formal measures       in dealing with children, the greater the risk we draw them further into       the system.
So we need to use those measures very carefully, and in a way       that tackles the needs, not merely the deeds, of all young people who       offend.'
(5.3)     Confirming the `significant impact' that the work of McAra and McVie has       had on the 2005-2010 Labour and 2010- Coalition governments in England and       Wales, as developed by the Youth Justice Board (YJB), ex-Chief Executive       of the YJB, John Drew, has stated: `...the Edinburgh study is the most       significant large scale piece of research in this area undertaken in the       last several decades and needs careful review by all policy makers and       practitioners working in this area.'
(5.8)     b.
Influencing amendment to the Children's Hearings (Scotland) Act         2011     The age of criminal responsibility in Scotland (currently age 8) is one       the lowest globally.
The children's charity Action for Children Scotland       used ESYTC findings about poor long-term outcomes for children dealt with       through the Children's Hearing System as supporting evidence for their       report `Where's Kilbrandon Now?'
(2010).
This report examined proposals       for reform to the youth justice system via the Children's Hearings       (Scotland) Bill.
It stated: `The [Edinburgh] Study offers a huge amount of       information and analyses on the lives and fortunes of these children and       the connections between socio-economic circumstances, parenting,       interventions, school exclusions and crime.
This should be of immense       interest and use to government, councils and panels in shaping the       services needed and avoiding the mistakes of the past.'
(p 11) (5.6).
McAra joined the Children's Hearings (Scotland) Act 2011 Working Group.
According to senior members of Scottish Government, the evidence from the       ESYTC was used as the `sole basis' for changes to the Children's Hearings       (Scotland) Act 2011 (Part 18, section 188) to ensure fewer children have       minor childhood transgressions disclosed to future employers and that       offences admitted at Children's Hearings no longer count as convictions,       but as alternatives to prosecution (5.7).
