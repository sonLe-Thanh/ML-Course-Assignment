     University of Glasgow research expertise has constructed a credible       bioscience foundation for the       innovative and hugely successful `Zombie Science'a programme,       which entertains, inspires and       educates young people in biological science within a broad genetics theme.
Zombie Science       engages young people through spoof tutorials on how to deal with a       hypothetical zombie epidemic,       thereby stimulating their interest in the underpinning biomedical science.
The project has far       exceeded predicted audience numbers, with direct engagement of more than       26,000 audience       members at over 300 events in secondary schools and festivals for comedy,       science and horror       across the UK (February 2011 to July 2013)b, consistently       receiving positive reviews from audience       participants and the media.
Delivering a scientifically accurate bioscience content     The original version of the show `Zombie Science 1Z' was       developed in 2010 through a collaboration between Dr O'Dell and       Time-Tastical Productions, a Glasgow based production company       which has been creating and delivering science engagement       shows since 2009.
Aware of O'Dell's unique combination of       experience in biomedical research and public engagement, Time-Tastical       Productions approached O'Dell to seek his involvement in       a biomedically-based production.
This partnership led to the successful       development of `Zombie         Science 1Z', centred on the biological science education of both       young people and adults.
Dr       O'Dell's involvement in this show was pivotal to the scientific accuracy       and design of the content       and to securing initial Wellcome Trust funding.
Culturally relevant show engages thousands of young people     `Zombie Science 1Z' employs a unique approach to engage young       people with complex scientific       topics, by exploiting familiarity with literature, films and video games       about the `undead' and a       hypothetical condition labelled `Zombieism'.
The format of the show is a       spoof lecture featuring       multimedia elements and live demonstrations.
`Doctor Austin', a       Theoretical Zombiologist at the       University of Glasgow's Zombie Institute for Theoretical Studies (ZITS) is       the `scientist', a character       designed to challenge the preconceptions of `nerd' scientists held by the       target audience of young       adults.
By using comedy as a tool for science communication, audiences are       guided through a       process of scientific problem solving, in which the `zombie' is presented       as a model system       exhibiting marked observable characteristics.
Dr O'Dell has developed much       of the accurate       scientific content around his own work.
For example, his studies of Drosophila       with genetic       abnormalities directly informs the `module' of `Zombie Science 1Z'       that examines why some people       might be more susceptible to Zombieism.
The performance and the associated       `Course Notes'       stimulate young people to think about how a new disease is identified, how       it is treated, how       infection can be controlled and how cures are developed - consequently       educating them in       genetics, viruses, infectious diseases and prion disease.
The course notes       include information on       how fruit flies may be used as models to recognise and potentially cure an       infectious condition in       humans.
To quote the course notes:     "An excellent way to test such a theory [that humans maybe be         genetically resistant to infection] is         by using fruit flies.
These amazing little insects share about 70% of         their genes with us, and it's         likely that the gene that could make some of us humans resistant to         Zombieism could also be         found in our fruit flies.
By conducting some fiendishly clever DNA         manipulation in our fruit flies,         we'll try to generate flies that are resistant to Zombieism."
(from       Zombie Science: Worst Case       Scenario course notes, p13).
This approach clearly reflects O'Dell's research strategy to exploit       flies as       models of human genetic disease, communicating the concept that genetic       abnormalities result in observable characteristics.
The show maintains an       optimal balance between delivering an accurate explanation of complex       science, and providing entertainment which captures and holds the       interest of the primary target audience: young people aged 11-18.
Subsequent funding from a 3-year Wellcome Trust Society Award in 2012       enabled the development of three new Zombie-themed biomedical shows.
The first of these new shows, `Zombie Science: Worst Case Scenario',       premiered at the London       Horror Festival in October 2012.
From written feedback formsc,       96% of respondents felt that they       learned something new about biomedical science and 72% thought they would       explore the subject       further as a result of the show.
This demonstrates extremely effective       initial engagement, and 62%       of the respondents agreed to give their details for a follow-up evaluation       questionnaire.
In addition,       the project has attracted a significant amount of positive coverage in the       media, including the       Times Higher Education magazine and performance review articles, which has       helped to broaden       the audienced.
The show has expanded its audience reach with       performances at the Brighton       Science Festival (February 2013, 187 audience members)e and the       Green Man Festival (Wales,       August 2013, 530 audience members).f     To encourage the audience to think about the science after attending a       show, they are invited to       visit the Zombie Science website and sit a multiple choice exam that is       based on information,       including aspects of the science, within the show.
Drawing again on the       theme of a genetic basis       for zombieism and stimulating students to think about fundamental aspects       of genetics the       following multiple choice questions are included in the Zombie Science         Worst Case Scenario       exam : `Your genome is like a genetic 'Book of You' with chapters we         call chromosomes, but how         many pairs of these chromosomes do you have?
A) 23, B) 22, C) 32'       (question 2).
Similarly       Question 5 reads `Gathering a person's DNA and determining their entire         DNA code is called DNA         sequencing.
The first complete Human DNA sequence was revealed in 2001.
How long did it take         researchers to do it?
A) 13 years, B) They are still at it now, C) 13         minutes'.
Raising aspirations of pupils in areas of social disadvantage     The original `Zombie Science 1Z' project, supported by a Wellcome       Trust Peoples Award, resulted       in direct engagement with 10,060 audience members (adults and young       adults) during 130 lectures       at over 40 events in schools and festivals over a 10 month periodb.
School performances were       specifically directed towards urban areas in a bid to raise aspirations of       students from       disadvantaged backgrounds.
The team achieved this aim by delivering the       show to 7,864       secondary school students (aged 11-18) in the Glasgow City Council       district.
An average of 60% of       the student population in these schools visited came from the most       deprived households       (according to Scottish Government MD20 criteria).
Feedback from teachers       has been uniformly       positive, with comments such as `Entertaining, informative, funny'       and `A fabulous show that         captivated the interest of our pupils'.
Since its introduction in       October 2012, the `Zombie Science:         Worst Case Scenario' show has been performed to almost 15,000       people, 90% of which were       secondary school studentsb.
Similarly, evaluation of the show       by teachers has confirmed the       success of the engagementg; 88% agreed that the show had had a       positive impact on the pupils       and 94% rated the scientific content of the show and online materials as       good or excellent       (responses obtained from a total of 17 schools).
Voluntary additional       comments on the show's       influence included `Senior pupils [have been] asking about suitable         courses to study biology as         they have seen zombie science event set up at school', `Pupils         are still taking [sic] about how much         they enjoyed it and the fun they had' and `The "hook" of         zombieism and the excellent entertaining         delivery helps get the messages across'.
When specific views on the       impact were surveyed, over       70% of teachers agreed that the show and online materials had supported       them in their teaching of       genetics to pupils with one teacher reporting `I gained more background         knowledge and would be         more confident to teach genetics'.
Extending the reach through significant online presence     Supporting materials include free `course notes' distributed at the       performances, a website and a       Facebook page.
Through online interaction at the Zombie Science website,       1,700 visitors have       completed the online `exam' based on the science within the show (February       2011 to July 2013)b.
The website also hosts a blog where scientific queries about the show are       answered, with Dr       O'Dell providing the scientific input.
Over 55% of the current Zombie       Science Facebook users are       between 13 and 24 years of age; the page has had 1,650 `likes' since its       establishment in 2012.h
