     Provision of authoritative guidance to international policymakers     Our world-leading research into the impacts of climate change and       stratospheric ozone depletion       on Arctic ecosystems has fed directly into the authoritative international       assessment reports       commissioned for policymakers and scientists.
Callaghan made major       contributions to the Arctic         Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA 2005) [S1] commissioned by       the Arctic Council (ministers of the       eight Arctic nations).
He was a member of the Assessment Integration Team,       the liaison for the       Decision Makers' Summary, a contributing author to three chapters,       and lead author of the       Terrestrial Ecosystems chapter which highlighted the important       findings of our long-term field       experiments [R1, R2].
This led to Callaghan being a lead author for       the Polar Regions chapter [S2]       (which built on ACIA 2005) in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate         Change 4th Assessment       Report (IPCC 2007).
This won the Nobel Peace Prize with the authors       honoured "for their efforts to         build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate         change, and to lay the         foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change"       (NobelPrize.org).
ACIA       2005 and IPCC 2007 have been the main internationally agreed       policy-focussed documents on       Arctic and Global climate change until 2011 and 2013, respectively.
Recent work on impacts of extreme winter warming on vegetation, and       pan-Arctic changes in snow       cover [R3, R4, R6] has fed directly into the group's major       contributions to Snow, Water, Ice and         Permafrost in the Arctic (SWIPA 2011) [S3].
This is the       Arctic Council's follow-up to ACIA and       contributed to the 5th IPCC report released in Sept. 2013.
The       commissioning of SWIPA reflects       the increasingly serious concerns about climate change impacts on the       Arctic cryosphere, and       Sheffield research has played a leading role in understanding some of       these threats.
Callaghan       was a core member of the SWIPA Integration Team, a co-ordinating lead       author on part of the       Cross-Cutting Scientific Issues, and scientific liaison for the Decision         Makers' Summary.
He was       co-ordinating lead author on the chapters Changing Permafrost and its         Impacts and Changing         Snow Cover and its Impacts, to which Phoenix contributed as an       author &#8212; as a result of the crucial       new insights provided by their research [R3,R4] and its       implications for indigenous societies [R6].
Stimulating and influencing policy debate     The ACIA [S1], IPCC [S2], and SWIPA [S3] reports       have transformed political and public       awareness of climate change and its impacts in the Arctic.
ACIA and SWIPA       are the standard       references for policy makers needing to understand global change and its       impacts in the Arctic       region.
The Arctic Council noted "with concern the impacts documented         by the ACIA" and       "acknowledge that such findings ... will help inform governments as         they implement and consider         future policies on global climate change" (Arctic Council's policy       document accompanying the       ACIA, 2005).
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton joined her counterparts       at the 2011 Arctic       Council Ministerial Meeting, in welcoming the release of SWIPA: "a         major climate science report on         the state of the frozen Arctic" assessing "how changes to human         activities and ecosystem services         within the cryosphere...will impact the Arctic ecosystem as well as         people living within the Arctic         and elsewhere in the world" [S10].
Callaghan and colleagues have also directly informed and stimulated       policy debate from their       research findings through face-to-face meetings and platform presentations       to ministers,       ambassadors, climate negotiators, religious leaders and royalty, including       showing visitors to the       Abisko Research Station their long-term field experiments and their       effects.
For example,       Callaghan hosted (July 2009), at the Abisko Research Station where he was       Director, a meeting of       twenty-seven Ministers of the Environment (including David Miliband) that       was also attended by       fifty ambassadors and climate negotiators [S4].
At this meeting       Callaghan provided policy guidance       on climate change impacts, including effects of loss of snow cover based       on his research [R1-R3]       in preparation for their negotiations at the United Nations Framework       Convention on Climate       Change (UNFCCC) conference (Copenhagen, December 2009).
On a separate       occasion, the EU       climate negotiating committee (Coreper) was hosted, briefed and shown the       Sheffield-led       experiments by Callaghan (again at Abisko) prior to their negotiations in       Copenhagen.
Findings       from SWIPA were presented to international ministers and climate       negotiators at the UNFCCC       Copenhagen conference (2009), and by Callaghan at the UNFCCC Durban       conference (2011),       including important new evidence of the increasing loss of winter snow       cover [R5] and its impact on       vegetation [R3].
Callaghan has also advised on Arctic and climate       change policy by invitation to       round-table discussions at four Royal Colloquia (2003, 2005, 2011 and       2012, organised by the       King of Sweden).
Most recently (Oct 2013), Callaghan, in his capacity as       lead author of the Polar         Regions chapter in IPCC 2007, advised on sustainable use of natural       resources in polar regions at       a strategic level conference organised by MP James Gray [S5].
Knowledge-exchange for adaptation to climate change by indigenous         peoples     Dissemination of research, contributions to the major international       synthesis reports and       knowledge exchange with Arctic indigenous communities has allowed       Sheffield scientists to       improve the way indigenous Arctic societies adapt to climate change.
This       is exemplified by the       impact on changing practices of reindeer herding societies:     "the ACIA, the polar chapter of IPCC, and SWIPA have advised the         international reindeer         herders of ongoing and future Arctic changes"; "these         publications have been instrumental in         preparing a knowledge foundation for circumpolar reindeer herding         societies for understanding         and adapting to climate change and globalization, and has been         instrumental in reindeer herders         planning for future sustainable communities" [S6].
Callaghan played a leading role in this engagement with indigenous       people, including his invitation       of a Sami social anthropologist to be a lead author on the Terrestrial         Ecosystems chapter of ACIA,       and a Sami reindeer herder and economist to be a lead author on the Changing         Snow Cover and         its Impacts chapter of SWIPA.
"Prof. Terry Callaghan was among         the first scientific lead authors to         include indigenous peoples' concerns and even indigenous co-authors";       "Callaghan has been         instrumental to bridge the gap between natural science ... concerns of         indigenous peoples and         their ... traditional knowledge" [S7].
Advice to the herders       has been wide ranging, and includes the       direction not to burn forest killed by autumnal moth outbreaks because of       the resulting loss of       nitrogen.
Callaghan's activities to draw on indigenous peoples'       traditional knowledge to enhance       scientific understanding [R6] have been widely recognized.
His work       has made "significant         contributions to the future sustainability of Arctic reindeer herding         communities and thereby         reindeer herding cultures" [S6].
"For a long time, Professor Terry Callaghan ... has had a close         cooperation with the County         Administrative Board [Norrbotten, Sweden] ... as well as the         S&#228;mi.
This has had great impact on         decisions regarding reindeer herding and nature conservation.
Many         decisions on local, regional         and national level have been based on Prof. Callaghan's experiences and         suggestions."
[S8]     Increasing public awareness and influencing education.
Callaghan's Arctic research has enhanced public understanding of Arctic       climate change as       evidenced by considerable international media attention.
This includes a       front-page summary and       near full-page main report in Norway's leading daily, Aftenposten       (19 October 2009) [S9], a full-       page article in one of Sweden's top newspapers Nyheter (15 July       2009) and TV coverage in       Sweden, Russia and Greenland.
The research has featured in ACIA and SWIPA       outreach films.
The work has also significantly influenced secondary school education.
At       the request of the A-       level Chief Examiner, Callaghan addressed teachers' conferences, leading       to a focus on climate       change impacts in the Arctic regions and its global consequences being       placed on the Geography       A-level syllabus.
He was subsequently asked to be lead author on an       A-level textbook, Top Spec         Geography: The Rapidly Changing Arctic (published 2011) and has been       asked to simplify this for       primary schools.
In summary, the paradigm-shifting research led by Callaghan and Phoenix       on climate change       impacts on Arctic ecosystem functioning, and their engagement in       knowledge-exchange for       adaptation to climate change by indigenous peoples, has had major impacts       on policymakers and       the public in the UK and internationally.
The research, and engagement in       impact activities, has led       directly to provision of authoritative guidance to UK and international       policymakers both in formal       reports and face-to-face briefings, increased public awareness of the       issues through media       coverage, outreach films and influencing the A-Level Geography curriculum       and education through       a school textbook.
