     The research on underage drinking and alcohol sales have been presented       to a broad audience       including retail organisations, government departments, health       practitioners and charities.
The       work has made an impact in a number of ways, as outlined below.
Impact on policy:       Leicester County Council was asked to investigate whether appropriate       measures were in place to       regulate and mitigate the effects of Binge Drinking in the county.
The       report `Binge         Drinking In Leicestershire - Scoping Review       (Max Hunt, 2008) used Piacentini and Banister's paper `Getting       Hammered' (2006) &#8212; it was the only academic paper used as background       material for this review.
In 2010, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation cited Banister and Piacentini's       2008 paper in their       policy report `Drinking         to belong: Understanding young adults' alcohol use within social         networks'.
The paper, aimed at policy-makers and health educationalists, explores the       decision making       process young adult's use before consuming alcohol and its affordability       and availability in the UK.
The research insights on alcohol sales have primarily been impactful       through the establishment of       CAPs (see www.communityalcoholpartnerships.co.uk).
The findings of the Cashiers study were       presented at The Home Office, to an audience comprising Police, Trading       Standards, Education,       Health and Retail representatives, and fed directly into this programme.
The Chair of the Retail of       Alcohol Standards Group (RASG), which was set up in 2005 by leading       supermarket retailers,       confirms that `the research unearthed numerous practically useful         insights, including: the social         and psychological stresses involved in asking colleagues to "challenge"         customers about their         age; the role of gender in the process of "challenge"; and crucially,         the way in which "test         purchase" enforcement methods had a tendency to alienate the very         checkout operators - by         "catching them out" &#8212; that needed to be highly motivated guardians of         responsible process.
This         last insight fed directly into the RASG's decision to advocate a         collaborative model of local action:         Community Alcohol Partnerships.'
The Advisory Board of the CAP is made up of retailers, voluntary and       charity sectors, the police       and trading standards.
Funding is provided by all the major alcohol       retailers, who have already       invested &#163;1m in the programme.
The partnerships were based on the research       presented at the       Home Office and initially trialled in St Neots, Cambridgeshire.
The pilot       findings showed a       reduction of up to 94% on key indicators such as alcohol-related litter       (see `Protecting young       people from alcohol-related harm', Better Regulation Delivery Office,       2009).
The programme has       received significant investment from major alcohol retailers and has       spread nationally.
As of       September 2013, 55 CAPs were operating throughout the UK.
The CAP Programme Manager corroborates that this `research was also         the catalyst for a move         from Challenge 21 to Challenge 25...
Challenge 25 is one the most widely         recognised strategies         for preventing underage access to age restricted products and recent         statistics released by the         Department of Health have shown a continued downward trend in underage         sales in the off trade.'
This approach has been cited as best practice by the Home Office in       publications including,       `Selling alcohol responsibly: Good practice examples from the retail and       hospitality industries'       (2010).
KPMG were appointed to undertake an independent review of the       effectiveness of the       alcoholic drink industry's `Social Responsibility Standards' and their       contribution to a reduction in       alcohol harm in England.
They worked with Lancaster University to       interview industry and non-industry       stakeholders across eight locations in England and in 2008 they produced a       `Review         of the Social Responsibility Standards for the production and sale of         Alcoholic Drinks'       for the Home       Office.
This was further cited by Sainsbury's in their submission for the       Scottish Government's       consultation paper `Changing         Scotland's relationship with alcohol'.
The CAP programme has been       commended in a number of parliamentary debates on Police         Reform and Social Responsibility Bill       (2011) and the Policing         and Crime Bill (2009) and a House         of Commons Health Committee Public Health Report (2011).
Impact on retail and medical practice:       The research from the study of alcohol and young consumers has had impact       mainly in terms of       alcohol education aimed at practitioners.
The work was initially presented       at academic       conferences and policy-oriented conferences, notably the Alcohol Focus       Scotland Harm       Reduction Conference Glasgow in February, 2006.
Following this conference,       Piacentini and       Banister were invited to write a paper for Alcoholis, a bulletin the       Medical Council on Alcohol       (MCA) newsletter distributed to all GPs and medical students in the UK.
This was published in       2006, entitled `Understanding         Alcohol Consumption Among University Students'.
This research       was subsequently cited by a member of the Medical Council on Alcohol at       annual conferences,       between 2008 and 2010, to the BMA Medical Students Committee (e-mail       available upon       request).
The workshops focused on the personal consumption of alcohol by       medical students and       the possible effects that might develop in their ability to practise as       doctors in the future.
The work       was also detailed on the website of the Victoria         Alcohol and Drug Association (VAADA), a drug       and alcohol education organisation aimed at alcohol practitioners in       Melbourne, Australia.
The findings of Hopkinson's and Humphrey's work were referenced by the       National Institute for       Clinical Excellence (NICE) in their Public         Health Programme Guidance on Alcohol-use disorders.
It       was disseminated to independent retailers as the research progressed (for       example Off         Licence News       and Convenience         Store magazine).
The report findings enabled shop keepers to feel       more       empowered and confident about their practices.
The work has also had an       impact in retail practice       outside the context of CAPs through presentation to the retail trade       (including the multiple grocery       and off-licence sectors).
The Wine and Spirits Association released new         guidance on tackling       underage drinking based on the CAP programme.
Most tangibly the work was incorporated in a training video, which has       been used throughout the       SPAR group.
This featured Senior Trading Standards Officers who presented       `real-life' cases,       making the DVD more impactful.
James Hall and Co. (Preston) that produced       the DVD said that       the work done at Lancaster `on the behaviour of cashiers and         age-related sales, helped our         organisation to give us the understanding of the challenges that our         teams face on a daily basis         and helped us to build these challenges into the filming of the DVD.'
Impact via the national media:       The research findings have also been brought to the general public through       `media exposure' for       example a Guardian         Newspaper Feature called `The Party's Over' on 3rd June,       2008 and a BBC       Radio 4's `Thinking Allowed' feature on `Students'         Drinking', 12th September, 2012 (links provided       below).
This has drawn attention to the issues around young people and the       challenges of not       drinking to the listeners of the programme.
