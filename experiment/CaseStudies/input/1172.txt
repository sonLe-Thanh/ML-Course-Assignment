     NEEM led to major improvements in quantitative policy analysis in the       North East of England, taking the region to the forefront of regional       economic planning within the country from 2008.
Knowledge transfer to policy practitioners       NEEM constitutes a tool that played a pivotal role in moving regional       policy-makers towards a more coherent, systematic and information-based       analytical framework.
Its knowledge transfer role was in part delivered       through a series of research seminars at ONE, the formation of a modeling       discussion forum (below) and by training programmes for ONE staff and       other practitioners on using NEEM and interpreting its results.
The       analytical work undertaken using the model (including that embodied in       numerous reports and briefings) and the embedding of knowledge through       formal knowledge transfer related to NEEM, gave practitioners a more       realistic and otherwise unobtainable understanding of how the regional       economy works and led to markedly improved policy analysis and design.
Former Head of Regional Strategy at ONE suggests that `the model was       critical to the RDA and partners (including local authorities) as a means       of ensuring shared assumptions in planning and economic development policy       across the local authority areas in the North East.
It made a significant       impact on regional development activity, and this was further enhanced       when we began to understand interfaces with other models, including around       carbon emissions and transport.'
(Testimonial 1).
The former Corporate       Research Manager at Northumberland County Council (NCC), considered that       the model's `greatest merit was probably... in its educational impact on       researchers and policy-makers' (Testimonial 2).
Catalyst for developing extended regional modelling capacity       The model played a key role in NE policy circles in fostering a culture       (ongoing and intensifying throughout the REF period) where policy       modelling became accepted and even routinized.
Based initially around       meetings and discussions relating to NEEM itself, region-wide planning       practitioners began meeting formally (from 2005 to 2010) as the NE       Economic Modelling User Group.
This group gave rise to further initiatives       that permitted integrated modeling across diverse aspects of the economy,       including demography, housing and the environment.
Of the various policy       reports produced using the NEEM, 17 (of 20) were produced from 2008 or       after &#8212; or relate directly to the REF period.
(See full list of relevant       policy reports in Evidence 1).
Thus, from 2008, the NEEM was central to       achieving a clear process of advancement in the use of scientific tools to       analyse regional issues in an integrated manner.
As the former Modelling       Manager of the North East Regional Information Partnership (NERIP), states       in testimonial 3: `NEEM provides a highly detailed source of data about       the regional economy.
For regional partners, this provided a much richer       picture than was available from standard sources... NEEM saw considerable       use and, in my view, was of immense value in educating people both inside       and outside ONE, about some of the myths and realities of the regional       economy.
As well as the obvious uses for producing numbers on Output, GVA,       Productivity and so on, the data was also used to identify multiplier       effects in different sectors and saw its way into many internal reports'.
(Evidence 1).
Stronger evidence-base in regional policy-making       A further NEEM impact was to ensure that regional policy was founded upon       a much stronger evidential basis.
Regional economic planning was       underpinned by local capacity to make a systematic quantitative assessment       of the various policy choices.
The following cases have been selected to       demonstrate NEEM's impact in this respect.
Regional Economic Strategy         NEEM was a key driver in the evolution of the Regional Economic Strategy         (RES) from the participatory (but largely unscientific) process to a         more quantitative-based approach, as reflected in the Integrated         Regional Strategy (IRS), developed to cover the period 2006-2016.
The         RES document, Leading the Way (Evidence 2) embodies extensive         NEEM analysis, which provided the basis for the RES Action Plan         (Evidence 3).
For example, it allowed ONE to improve its inter-sectoral         growth targets for 2006-16.
NEEM projections showed that the initial         growth targets were simply not feasible; the credibility of the NEEM         helped ONE to achieve consensus among regional stakeholder groups in         support of a more feasible growth strategy that was implemented after         2008.
The Corporate Research Manager of NCC said that the model `brought         into focus the reality of the economy and its interdependencies.
It         debunked growth targets that were not possible; that had initially         formed part of policy at county and regional level' (Testimonial 2).
(This testimonial relates to Evidence 3.)
The (then) Chief Economist at         ONE states that the NEEM `played a major role in shaping the work of a         number of public agencies... [and by 2011] has left the region in a much         stronger position to develop its economic priorities and to engage in         informed discussions over public and private investment' (Testimonial         4).
Economic restructuring         One of NEEM's strengths is in analysing economic restructuring following         `shocks' to the economy.
The fact that the model is primarily a regional         one, built from the `bottom up', makes it superior for this purpose than         top-down national models that are only superficially modified for         regional analysis.
An example is the response to the Corus steel closure         on Teesside in January 2010 (Evidence 4).
In this case, an over         assessment of multiplier effects was made public by Teesside-based         stakeholders, to justify a significant diversion of regional resources         to that locality.
However, Durham's NEEM-based analysis for ONE         demonstrated these estimates to be substantially exaggerated, enabling         regional partners to design a more appropriate regional policy response.
(As testimonial 4 puts it: "I drew on the model many times to understand         the impact of major redundancies on the region's growth and employment.
That included working through the effects of some of very high profile         shocks to the region e.g.
Northern Rock, Corus and Nissan.
The model         gave myself, and the senior leadership team, confidence to enter into         robust debates on the state of the region and its investment needs with         central government (Ministers and senior officials)".
NEEM's role in         facilitating the shift towards greater evidence-based decision-making         thus helped reduce the power of regional actors to press unrealistic         claims to advance their own area's interests at the expense of others.
NEEM was also similarly applied to the analysis of other closures during         the REF period (e.g.
Alcan's aluminium plant &#8212; report published 2012 &#8212;         evidence 5), organisational downsizing (Northern Rock &#8212; report published         2010 &#8212; Testimonial 4), impact of reduced government spending (Evidence         6) and major infrastructure investments (Hitachi train factory (report         published 2012), High Speed Broadband network (report published 2012) &#8212;         both listed in Evidence 1).
In these cases, NEEM enabled policymakers to         achieve better-informed estimates of impact, giving greater credibility         to their bids to central government/the Treasury for support or special         initiatives, and improving efficiency and equity with respect to public         spending.
Local planning: the cases of Durham and Northumberland County             Councils         NEEM has also had impacts on more localized (sub-regional) economic         planning processes.
This application provided transparent results based         on clear underlying assumptions and helped planners fine-tune their         plans around their own local knowledge.
Again, using scaled-down         national models was regarded as unsatisfactory because of their opaque         (`black box') nature and the limited scope they offered for bringing         local knowledge to bear on the issue.
Thus, NEEM was recognized as         providing the basis for a demonstrably superior planning process.
The         former manager at NCC states: `NEEM was used to understand the national         recession's knock-on effects to Northumberland; the likely effects of         the closure of Alcan...; the real significance of Agriculture (huge) and         Tourisms impact (frequently exaggerated)' (see Testimonial 2).
Renewal of NEEM support funding:         Funding for NEEM was renewed twice, in 2005 and 2009.
Former Modelling         Manager at NERIP, points out that `the second renewal only took place         because the model had clearly demonstrated its worth' (Testimonial 3).
Although funding for NEEM was terminated when ONE was abolished by the         Coalition government in 2010, the model's importance for local and         regional planning is confirmed by the `Updating the North East Economic         Model' contract awarded by Newcastle City Council (Evidence 7) in order         to facilitate the preparation of a `Skills Action Plan'.
This         collaborative initiative by NE Local Economic Partnerships recognises         NEEM's previous contribution to labour market planning.
As, Head of         Regional Strategy Manager at ONE NE, notes: `It has... become very         apparent over the past two years that there is a significant gap in the         field of strategic economic activity around developing shared         underpinning assumptions to make investment decisions.
For this reason,         a decision has been taken at the regional level to redevelop NEEM and         use it for skills investment and a variety of other purposes going         forward' (Testimonial 1).
