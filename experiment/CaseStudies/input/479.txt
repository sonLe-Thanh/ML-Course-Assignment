     Impact delivery mechanisms     The research outputs from the two specific projects have been developed       into a number of "delivery vehicles" which have been adopted and embedded       very widely by industry:            In-depth insight into the key issues with powder quality and flow on a         large number of industrial plants that have been studied (12 during the         research and around 100 more since), which have been built in to the         dissemination routes described below.
These include such issues as where         to look for causes of problems in a plant; how to obtain meaningful         samples from the plant and characterise them in ways that synthesise the         behaviour seen on-plant; how to redesign equipment to avoid problems;         and how to use the techniques to ensure right-first-time designs.
A series of innovative instruments and facilities used by industry         (the Brookfield Powder Flowability Tester; QPM Segregation and         Degradation Testers, and Caking Test Suite) for measuring behavioural         properties of powders, specifically their flow properties and their         tendencies to segregate, degrade and cake in handling, processing and         storage.
A series of techniques for using the results from the above-mentioned         instruments - mainly analytical and numerical models - to predict the         behaviour of the powders in industrial processes (eg storage, transport,         feeding/dispensing, heating/cooling, conveying) for use in plant design,         powder formulation and process trouble-shooting.
A much augmented series of educational courses for engineers in         industry, to allow them to use this knowledge practically in their         companies.
Example course titles include Powder Quality, Bulk Solids         Handling, Biomass Handling, and Design of Hoppers (www.bulksolids.com).
A service used extensively by industry (+50 projects PA) for plant         design and troubleshooting, eg reducing or eliminating problems with         caking, degradation or segregation and poor flow of particulates, also         fugitive dust, poor product quality etc which are commonplace and very         costly.
Realisation of impact     Realisation has been through several channels: since 2008, 16 companies       around the globe (from SMEs to multinationals) have funded 23 substantial       programmes of consultancy or applied research to embed the direct outputs       from the initial QPM project.
They are either embedding the instruments       and techniques directly in their own material characterisation and product       design roadmaps, or funding studies at the Wolfson Centre to research the       behaviour and formulation of their own materials further using the QPM       techniques, and using the outputs of these further projects in their       plants.
There have also been three KTP projects.
Example 1: converting Drax power station to biomass: the world's       largest biomass power project, involving conversion of the 3960MW Drax       (UK) coal fired power station to 50% biomass.
Wolfson was engaged to       deploy QPM techniques to inform and optimise the design of the new &#163;210M       fuel handling, storage and feeding facility, predicting and minimising the       physical degradation of the wood pellet fuel in the handling process (dust       and fines have a profound effect on safety, performance and efficiency of       fuel delivery to the power station) and ensuring reliable flow.
Similar       studies were also made for Tilbury (becoming for two years the world's       largest biomass power station) and Uskmouth power stations.
Example 2: the Brookfield           `Powder Flowability Tester' (PFT), arising from QPM       via the following DEFRA AFM 206 research, is manufactured in the US by       multinational Brookfield Viscometers and on sale globally.
Around 200       machines (value ~&#163;2M) have been sold in 24 countries in three years since       launch in 2010.
It has become the most widely-used shear tester world-wide       for studying the behaviour of powders, in industries as diverse as food,       pharmaceuticals, energy, chemicals and any others that use powders.
A       further 42 companies have embedded through 61 funded projects of       consultancy or applied research at Wolfson, based on use of the instrument       and its underpinning research on powder flow, to research and improve       their feedstocks, processes and products.
Wider impacts     The powders research that built on the QPM and DEFRA outputs have had       deep impact in their fields (173 embedment projects funded by 123           companies since 2008).
Manufacturing sectors reached include       pharma, food, minerals, powder metallurgy and chemicals overseas and in       the UK, including many blue-chips eg GlaxoSmithKline (11       projects to embed the research in plant design or problem-solving,       protecting multiple &#163;Billions of production annually), Masterfoods       (9), Norgine (7), Unilever (6), Portasilo       (4) and many others.
These impacts are significant improvements to the       design of new or existing plants which process many millions of pounds of       product annually, an enduring impact of on-going benefits to process       efficiency and/or product quality in products ranging from cosmetics,       drugs and snack foods to cement, automotive parts and power generation.

The resulting heavily revised and augmented series of educational courses       for engineers in industry (http://www2.gre.ac.uk/about/schools/engineering/wolfsoncentre/coupro/sc),       has been attended by 677 paying delegates from over 250 companies since       2008, including delivery locally at 12 companies in the UK, EU and       overseas including India and China; demand for places on these courses is       accelerating.
Many of these companies have gone on to use the techniques       to improve their manufacturing systems or equipment designs (see SHAPA       corroboration).
This research has set the Wolfson Centre and CNMPA up as the "go to"       centre for expertise in powder and bulk solids handling in the UK and       Europe, and one of the three leading groups globally.
This ensures its       ability to attract the top research challenges and collaborators within       its field, and embed the outputs in not only the top "blue chip"       manufacturing companies globally but also a large number of SMEs that       together make up a substantial portion of the supply chain.
