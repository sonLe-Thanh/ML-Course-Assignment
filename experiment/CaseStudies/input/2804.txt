            Building relationships with schools to improve teaching and             learning     Since 2003, we have alternated biannually between holding conferences for       Philosophy teachers and for sixth-form Philosophy and Religious Studies       students.
Conferences held for students attract on average 50 to each       event; those for teachers attract on average 15-25 from both East Sussex       and further afield, with over 50 teachers attending in the period.
In the design of the conferences, the Department liaised closely with       local schools Varndean College, Brighton Hove and Sussex Sixth Form       College, and Sussex Downs, canvassing their teachers' views on the right       time of year for the conference, the best format and what material would       be the most useful.
It also sought extensive feedback from all conference       participants.
Evidence of good relationships with local schools includes       the fact that teachers from these schools have been registrants every year       that the conference has run.
In addition, teachers from each of these       schools have pursued a postgraduate qualification in Philosophy at Sussex.
Focussing on 2012, 25 teachers attended from a range of types of school:       independent fee-paying (for instance, Bedales; Christ's Hospital; the       Norwich School), grammar (for instance, Barton Court; Sutton Grammar       School; The Judd School, Kent; Tiffin School, Kingston); and further       education colleges (for instance, City and Islington College; Shooter's       Hill post-16 campus).
It also included schools and colleges in a Widening       Participation relationship with Sussex University (Bexhill College; City       and Islington Sixth Form; Greenford High School, Ealing; The Regis School,       Bognor Regis; Sir George Monoux College, Walthamstow; Varndean College,       Brighton).
As well as from all over Sussex, participants came from London,       Norwich, Hampshire, and the Isle of Wight.
Impact has accrued in the REF period from each of the events we have held       from 2008-2013.
Evaluation of the events was formalised in 2012, and so       below we use resources from that process to illustrate the sorts of effect       that come from our work throughout the REF period.
Enhancing understanding     Feedback taken after the 2012 conference demonstrates the extent to which       participants found their understanding of curricula-related material       enhanced.
To the question `What did you find the most useful about the       conference today?'
there was acknowledgement of the extent to which the       talks had increased comprehension, in answers such as            `...the challenge to my own conceptions about materialism and         physicalism' [see Section 5, C1];       `The Philosophy of Mind and Political Philosophy were particularly         useful' [C1];       `The mind-body talk on Physicalism and Materialism will be essential         to my teaching of the life-after-death topic, and it corrects my major         misconception of materialism' [C1];       `Consideration of the anti-individualism/individualism distinction in         relation to the claim (e.g.
Searle's) that non-reductive monist theories         need not entail property dualism [C1];       `Philosophy of mind &#8212; a deeper analysis of token identity theory and         also other property dualist views than just the very basic, broad         argument' [C1].
Inspiring the production of new teaching materials     Feedback also showed that the papers would make a difference to the       future production of teaching resources:            `I will use the definitions of materialism and physicalism given to         help show a distinction between views' [C1];       `Lectures 4 and 5 (for example) would make an ideal pairing for two         consecutive lessons on "autonomy".
Lecture 1 would make a strong         introductory lesson to complex distinctions in the Philosophy of Mind'         [C1];       `The Mill, Berlin and Plato arguments/insights can all be shared with         my students';       `The handouts from Prof Morris's talk we can use in Unit 4 in         conjunction with the webcast of the talk' [C1];       `I will use Sarah Sawyer's tree diagram in teaching the philosophy of         mind and her lecture about non-reductive materialism in relation to         mental causation' [C1];       `Will use a version of the diagram presented to help explain to         students the various positions on mind/brain debate' [C1];       `I look forward to using the handouts provided by Prof. Morris next         spring term ... when teaching Book IV' [C2];       `The... lectures on ... free speech will be incorporated into my         Oxbridge (PPE) teaching in September.
The lecture on the Philosophy of         Mind will find a place in the middle of that course, once the Upper Six         are a little more confident' [C3];       `Just to say that I will definitely be using Sarah Sawyer's structure         of the theories of the philosophy of mind directly in my teaching as an         overview of how the theories fit together, and that her discussion on         non-reductive monism was very useful' [C3].
Providing a model for similar events in other departments     In 2012, a member of the Philosophy Department in Sheffield, contacted       Kathleen Stock to ask for detailed information about the conferences run       at Sussex.
Since then, they have run a one- day conference for teachers       with an identical format to the Sussex one, including a roundtable       discussion at the end.
