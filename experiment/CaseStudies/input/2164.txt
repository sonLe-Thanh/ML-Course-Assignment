     1) Influencing Policy Development and Debate     The sexualities equalities project's findings advanced       understanding of organisational resistance to implementing policies       granting new citizenship rights to sexual and gender minorities, which has       fed into policy debate and implementation in the UK (IMP1) and in       EU member states (IMP2).
The research methodology was adapted for       a major policy survey of public officials in 18 countries by the Equality       and Citizen's Rights Department of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights,       in order to better understand and enforce EU equalities legislation.
The       project has also influenced policies at regional and local levels.
A key       finding was the importance of leadership to champion the equalities agenda       and bring others on board.
This directly informed Newcastle Hospitals       Equality Delivery System which recommended that `people in senior         management positions... give a clear message about the importance of the         sexualities/trans equalities agenda in relation to employment         opportunities and all areas of service provision' (IMP3).
The post-trafficking research findings and participatory       methodology brought trafficked women's perspectives into policy       development and debates.
i) In Kathmandu, in February 2011, an Activist Workshop set up and led by       the research team brought together NGOs, donors, trafficked women and       high-level government representatives (80+).
Preliminary research findings       were used to review NGO programming and led directly to the following       policy debate and political lobbying.
Shakti Samuha, supported by the research team, drafted demands on         citizenship rights/livelihoods which were submitted to political parties         and elected government and Constituent Assembly (CA) core committees,         including the Fundamental Rights Committee (FRC).
Six specific         recommendations that were raised from the Activist Workshop are listed         in this document regarding citizenship provision to women and children         in general, plus a number pertaining to trafficked women and children         whose mothers were sexually exploited abroad (IMP4).
This led to the FRC Chair soliciting case studies of post-trafficked         women and their children's exclusion from citizenship from Shakti         Samuha.
Case studies co-selected by Shakti Samuha and the research team were         then presented by the FRC to the CA recommending that `children           without having a father's known identity should be granted rights of           citizenship'.
This demand was adopted in March 2012, and is         registered by the CA Secretariat to be ratified as part of the new         Constitution when the Secretariat and CA are re-elected (currently         scheduled for November 2013) (IMP5).
ii) As a technical expert to the National Committee in Controlling Human       Trafficking, the research team directly influenced recommendations on       access to social rights of citizenship for women post-trafficking (e.g.
housing, healthcare, victim support fund, education, livelihoods), later       endorsed by Cabinet in the National Plan of Action in May 2012 (IMP6).
iii) The American Bar Association used research findings to formulate       policy on witness protection and support services moving to ensure a `more         nuanced and survivor-centric framework for assessing survivors needs and         how justice actors should address those' (IMP7), citing the       collaboration between Shakti Samuha and Newcastle University in the       post-trafficking study as an example of best practice in their Human       Trafficking Assessment Tool Report (2011: 80-81).
iv) DFID's Asia social development agenda was directly informed by the       research team's input into the development, monitoring and evaluation       (M&amp;E) of DFID's large anti-trafficking regional programme (&#163;9.75       million: 2011-18).
DFID's Senior Social Development Advisor for Asia       states `[y]our research helped us understand the complexity of         trafficking and how it works and how it interacts and who to listen to',       and that the research team's input into the M&amp;E tender selection       process (Dec. 2011-Jan 2012) `gave professionalism, rigour and         expertise to our selection panel' (IMP8).
v) The research team influenced wider debates on post-trafficking through       extensive engagement with the Nepal media, including: over 11 TV and 25       radio interviews (some web-streamed internationally), 8 print media       articles (half in the major English daily, Kathmandu Post), and       conceptual input into the anti-trafficking documentary The Color of         Brave (made by Film Himalaya).
Metrics on research project website       visits indicate impact on a large readership (51,932 visitors, January       2010-October 2013).
Figures for the last year show 75% new visits, with       visitors from 10 countries (Google Analytics).
2) Capacity Building     The sexualities equalities research included Action Learning Sets       (ALS), groups which met four times, over six months in each of the four       case study areas of the UK.
This had a direct influence on capacity       building networks for the 33 local government and voluntary/community       workers who took part.
In each ALS members shared examples of good       practice and identified action points which were then reviewed at       subsequent ALS meetings, where the next steps for implementing action were       decided.
For example, identifying LGBT equalities training available in       Northern Ireland (NI) was a key action point for the NI ALS.
The next step       was to design and plan training, which resulted in a joint capacity       building event with the NI Equalities Commission in April 2010.
In some       cases the ALS continued after the project ended; for example the Southern       England ALS organised a training workshop with a regional Equalities       Network.
The underpinning research has also informed practice guidelines       in Local Authorities, housing associations, the voluntary and community       sector, and healthcare.
For example, the Social Care Institute for       Excellence At a Glance Report cited the research findings in its       recommendations for the development of training programmes (IMP9).
The post-trafficking research generated impact through capacity       building to enhance survivors' input into lobbying for citizenship rights.
At the local level in Nepal, drawing on the research team's expertise, a       modular training programme in action-research methodologies was put       together.
This was delivered to the Shakti Samuha leadership, which       consisted of 12 post-trafficked women, between 2010 and 2012.
The       importance of this training was emphasised in their presentation `Trafficking         Survivors to Social Researchers: Reflections on a Journey' to the       `Making Livelihoods: Sexuality, Citizenship and Stigma' Conference       (Kathmandu, November 2011; co-hosted by IOM, Newcastle University and       Shakti Samuha; the conference attracted 100+ participants including CA       members and senior policy-makers): `Research conducted by survivors         themselves would be more effective and would help to identify the real         status of trafficking survivors, identify their needs and make         recommendations to stakeholders in order to fulfil their actual needs'       (IMP10).
As a result of this training and with on-going       consultation with the research team, in 2012-13 Shakti Samuha designed and       implemented an action-research project to improve trafficked women's       access to justice when taking traffickers to court.
Research insights were       also used to provide training at national and international levels to       AATWIN (2010), Nepal's national anti-trafficking organisation (32 member       groups), and via IOM Turkmenistan (2012), to high-level Central Asian       policy makers, setting the scene to shape policy agendas.
