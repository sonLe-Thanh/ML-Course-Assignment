     Impact was achieved through Aissaoui's partnership with Association       G&#233;n&#233;riques and his close       involvement with the high profile exhibition organised by the Association       entitled Generations: A       Century of Maghrebi Cultural History in France, an exhibition that       showcased the richness of the       cultural production of North Africans in France in the twentieth century (A).
Miller's subsequent       work for the exhibition also contributed to impact.
Association G&#233;n&#233;riques       is a national       organisation which aims to preserve and promote the history and memory of       immigration in       France.
It identifies and preserves archives on immigration in Europe       through cultural and       scientific initiatives.
As a result of his research on the political, cultural and social       development of the North African       diaspora and on the construction of racism in the colonial and       post-colonial periods in France, Dr       Aissaoui was appointed as a key academic member of the Scientific       Committee of G&#233;n&#233;riques (E)       which was responsible for defining the thematic content and structure of       the exhibition.
His work on       the concepts of national and ethnic identity and on the development on       political activism among       Algerian migrants in France in the colonial period and on North Africans       in France in the       postcolonial period informed a series of meetings held by the Scientific       Committee in Paris       between 2006 and 2008 to develop the exhibition project.
The Generations exhibition retraced a century of the cultural       history of North Africans in France       through music, film, literature, visual arts, theatre and politics.
It       chronicled the significant moments       of resettlement from the Maghreb, through cultural practices, intellectual       life and artistic creativity,       and included largely unpublished audio and audio-visual archival       materials.
The exhibition has       been visited by more than 50,000 people at three venues (B, C):            Archives Municipales de Lyon, France, between 11th June and         29th August 2009 (D).
Cit&#233; nationale de l'Histoire de l'Immigration (CNHI), Palais de la         Porte Dor&#233;e, Paris, between         17 November 2009 and 18th April 2010       Coll&#233;giale St S&#233;pulcre, Avenue de la Lib&#233;ration, Caen, from 11th         March 2011 to 29th April         2011.
The exhibition will also be open to the public at Clo&#238;tre des Jacobins         in Toulouse from October         2013 to January 2014.
As well as providing crucial strategic input into the structure and       content of the exhibition, Aissaoui       made a number of other material contributions including:            A chapter for the exhibition catalogue entitled "Political         mobilisation and cultural events among         the Maghrebi community in France between the wars".
The chapter         chronicled the         development of Algerian nationalism in the interwar period in France and         shed light on the role         of culture in Algerian political activism and anti-colonialism before         the Second World war (F).
A selection of short biographies of Algerian political activists in         the colonial period for the         exhibition (G).
The exhibition included a day conference in Lyon in June 2009 which         examined stereotypes         and misrepresentations of the Maghrebi community.
Aissaoui presented a         paper entitled         "Maghrebi cultural circles in Metropolitan France 1934-1939" and Miller         presented a paper on         "The Maghrebi and Comics" (H).
As part of the same conference, Aissaoui gave a radio interview to         Agora FM in which he         discussed the relationship between culture, politics and antiracism in         France (H).
This exhibition was cited as a prime example of good practice in the       fight against racism and       prejudice in the Annual Report Fight against Racism, Antisemitism and         Xenophobia presented to       the French Prime Minister by the National Consultative Commission of Human       Rights in 2010 (p.       277(J)).
It was described by the French press as "an answer to current       problems of stigmatisation       and identity crisis... focusing on the promotion of a collective culture"       and "an exhibition that should       break old clich&#233;s".
The exhibition touched tens of thousands of members of the public, many       of whom left testimonies       in a visitors' book, which chronicled the impact of the exhibition on       their perspective and emotions.
They included the following messages:            "Bravo!
We are proud to be French, finally!
A (minimal) reparation but         a reparation         nonetheless!
Thank you for all that smart and sensitive work."
"We will have to all agree, we must live together."
"This is a very beautiful and rich exhibition.
It enriches the history         of France."
"A significant exhibition, even more important given world events, but         also policies in France."
"A beautiful and valuable collection of memories which will hopefully         enlighten our life         together."
"A magnificent exhibition, a milestone in our national history."
Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, currently Minister of Women's Rights and         spokesperson for the         French Government led by Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, declared         after her visit to the         exhibition: "Thank you for this moving exploration of the past.
I hope         that it will teach some of         us about the failures of our present."
An effective communications strategy by G&#233;n&#233;riques with the CNHI,       including an online press       pack, raised the profile of the exhibition nationally, resulting in three       reports on Radio France; four       short documentaries (T&#233;l&#233;rama, TV5 Monde, France 3, M&#233;diapart); five       programmes on Beur FM.
National and regional newspapers and magazines reported on the exhibition       (Le Monde,       Lib&#233;ration, L'Humanit&#233;, Le Point, T&#233;moignage         Chr&#233;tien, Ouest France, etc (I)).
To accompany the       exhibition, a number of activities were developed, including film       showings, art and music shows       and guided school visits.
A music CD box set (3 CDs) entitled The         Masters of Maghrebi Music in         Exile was produced with EMI music and online resources were       designed, including pedagogical       dossiers for teachers and students that were widely used and a virtual       pedagogical tour of the       exhibition.
The exhibition attracted the support of many influential individuals in       France, including       representatives of France's Ministry of Culture, France Television and       French politicians,       intellectuals and business people.
These included Bertrand Delano&#235; (Mayor       of Paris); Bertrand       Collomb (Mayor of Lyon); Philippe Douste-Blazy (Foreign Secretary       2005-2007); Laurent Fabius       (MP, Prime Minister 1984-1986); Jean-Claude Gaudin (Mayor of Marseille and       Vice-President of       the Senate); Alain Jupp&#233; (Prime Minister 1995); Jack Lang (Culture       Minister 1981-1986/1988-1993);       Pierre Mauroy (Prime Minister 1981-1984); Mehdi Charef (novelist and       director); Christian       Poncelet (President of the Senate, 1998-2008); Louis Schweitzer (Chairman       of Renault until 2005)       and Le&#239;la Sebbar (novelist).
