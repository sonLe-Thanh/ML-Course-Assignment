     Kelvin Connect has continued to build upon this software to create a set       of products that have been used by police forces in Scotland, England and       Wales, and in the healthcare sector.
The University received support from       Scottish Enterprise in the spin-out company's early years, including a       Royal Society of Edinburgh/Scottish Enterprise `Enterprise Fellowship' for       Dr Meurig Sage (Research Assistant on the Paraglide project) to support       the formation of the company and product development, sales and marketing       efforts.
In 2002 Sage went on to become the company's Chief Technical       Officer and is currently in this post in 2013.
By 2008 Kelvin Connect had partnered with Airwave, the primary       communications supplier for UK emergency services, to provide mobile       handheld data capture devices to police in Strathclyde, Lothian and       Lancashire regions.
In 2008 Airwave invested &#163;1million in the company to       support Kelvin Connect's rapid growth and to enable it to successfully bid       for large law enforcement contracts through the National Police       Improvement Agency's Accelerator Programme.
In 2011 the University       spin-out was wholly purchased by Airwave for an undisclosed seven-figure       sum.
Kelvin Connect now operates as an independent subsidiary of Airwave       Solutions.
It currently employs 30 staff and is in the process of       expanding further.
The `Pronto' product developed by Kelvin Connect and based on the       original University of Glasgow ParaGlide research, can be easily and       quickly configured to meet customer needs; it supports the rapid       deployment of mobile information solutions allowing:            data to be easily captured and accessed on a range of mobile devices,         using discreet forms for specific purposes, ie for a police constable or         traffic warden to enter details of parking offences       data to be sent to a central Pronto server where it can be managed         using sophisticated workflow rules and can be accessed by relevant         users.
Pronto has been in use by the Lothian &amp; Borders police since 2005.
In       2008 Lothian &amp; Borders began to roll out the use of Pronto to its       entire force (The force covers an area of 2,500 square miles and serves a       population of almost one million people, with around 4,110 staff including       over 3,000 police officers.)
From 2005 to 2012, Kelvin Connect has       deployed more than 30 mobile processes to Lothian &amp; Borders police,       delivering business benefits such as the following:            The use of digital and mobile Fixed Penalty Notices has reduced         processing time from 4 minutes to 17 seconds, with the additional         benefit that tickets issued are now 100% accurate (compared to a         previous 80% accuracy rate, eliminating time and resource in dealing         with returns).
This one process alone has saved &#163;126,000 per annum in         keying and filing processing costs.
With officers inputting crime reports directly via the electronic         notebook &#163;407,000 per annum has been saved in the cost of rekeying.
Other efficiency savings delivered through the use of Pronto include an       annual saving of 19,000 hours per annum of police constable time in       recording crime; a total saving of over 4,000 hours in the issuing of       traffic tickets and 1800 hours in the issue of ASBO fixed penalty tickets.
In total Lothian &amp; Borders Police estimate their annual savings       through the Pronto-supported changes to efficiency and frontline data       collection at &#163;600,000.
By 2013 Pronto had been rolled out to 10% of UK police forces including       Surrey, and Kelvin Connect is currently involved in a trial for a national       deployment of Pronto to all police forces in Scotland.
A customer       testimonial provided by Kelvin Connect states:     Being so close to London and with up to half of acquisitive crimes         committed by travelling criminals from London, the workforce needs to be         flexible and agile.
Getting trusted information to the point of decision         is key.
This device, alongside mobile fingerprinting and ANPR, is one of         the key elements of Operation Shield.
[Surrey Police]     In April 2013, Kelvin Connect successfully responded to the `One Box'       challenge set by the Association of Chief Police Officers to integrate the       Pronto e-notebook into police vehicles, allowing the capture of       information and images as well as the ability to search intelligence       databases and back-office systems.
In the healthcare sector, the Pronto mobile health solutions developed by       Kelvin Connect from the original ParaGlide research have been deployed to       several hundred community nurses and to nursing staff in 3 hospitals in       western Scotland.
The system can be configured to suit any clinical or       administrative team.
It enables fast, validated data entry at the point of       care/response and completely avoids the need to transcribe from paper       forms, saving staff time and ensuring swift transmission and dissemination       of patient or victim information.
The system has enabled hospitals (such       as Hairmyres, Monklands and Wishaw General &#8212; all NHS Lanarkshire) to       implement `Hospital at Night' services increasing the efficiency and       accuracy of patient information and handovers between shifts.
In summary, the University's ParaGlide project has provided the       foundation for the development of a successful University spin-out whose       products have developed from this initial research to provide solutions       that are saving the UK's police forces a minimum of over 50,000 officer       hours per annum.
In the healthcare sector, this technology provides a       completely mobile front end that supports the rollout of electronic       patient records and delivers faster and more accurate information from       patients to healthcare professionals.
