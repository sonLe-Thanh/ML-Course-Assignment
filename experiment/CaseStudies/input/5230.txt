     The new maize variety GM-6, developed by Bangor research using the novel       methods of PPB and PVS, was successfully released in Gujarat State in 2002       and, as shown below, has had a major impact on food production in Western       India between 2008 and 2013.
The relationship between the research output       (GM-6) and the impact is causal and direct and is related to the       production and economic benefits of growing GM-6 and the area upon which       it is grown.
Because of careful targeting of farmers' needs during the PPB       and PVS, the high benefits gained from the new variety did not require       additional input of resources by the farmers.
PPB and PVS produced a       variety that was earlier to mature than any of those produced by       conventional maize breeding, combined this trait with high yield, and took       fewer years to do so than conventional breeding methods [5.1, Witcombe et       al.
2007 (cited in section 3)].
Impact on production and international development: improved food           yield, security and economy       The impact resulting from the uptake of GM-6 on livelihoods of a sample of       farmers in three states in Western India that had previously been given       seed was surveyed [5.1].
Farmers liked the new variety for its higher       yield as well as other traits such as improved grain quality, earlier       maturity (7 days earlier silking than local varieties) and better       tolerance of major diseases and pests.
Because of its early maturity, GM-6       escapes terminal drought, resulting in a much lower frequency of failed       harvests.
Combined, these properties of GM-6 give a major advantage to       resource-poor farmers, allowing them to sell more grain, as well as       increasing their household food self-sufficiency.
Farmers reported       considerable impacts on their livelihoods with seed sales in maize       increasing by 51% and food self-sufficiency by more than one month.
Large-scale uptake of GM-6 during the 2008-13 period is attributable to       the evidence that during its period of rapid uptake over 70% of the       farmers growing this new maize variety reported an overall increase of       more than 10% in their total income [5.1].
A comprehensive survey of the seed production records of the 13 main       responsible institutions in the states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and       Rajasthan in western India by Yadavendra (2013) [5.2] showed that the       amount of GM-6 seed produced for sowing has increased rapidly from 2002 to       2013 with a notable acceleration during 2010-2013 (Figure 1 below).
During       the 2008-2013 period 1519 t of GM-6 seed for sowing was produced (over 250       t per year), which represents 54% of the cumulative total seed produced       since the release of the variety in 2002.
These documented values are       conservative as data are unavailable for private-sector non-certified       seed.
This indicates the sustained and accelerating demand for this seed       amongst farmers.
During 2008-2013 GM-6 accounted for over 91% of the total       recorded maize seed production in Gujarat State, and in each year during       2011-2013 it accounted for at least 98% of the total production (Figure 2       below, [5.2]).
Based on an average sowing rate of 20 kg seed/ha, the 1519 t of       officially certified GM-6 seed produced since 2008 enabled 76,000 ha of       maize to be planted.
Importantly, Yadavendra (2013) [5.2] determined that       the actual area of GM-6 planted is much greater than this, equating to an       estimated cumulative area of 1.08M ha since 2008.
This was based on an       estimate that 4% of farmers' harvest of GM-6 is sown as seed in subsequent       years.
This estimate is conservative as previous surveys [5.1] found that       farmers themselves sowed an average of 3% of the seed of GM-6 that they       harvested and distributed an additional 6% to relatives, friends and       neighbours for sowing.
This estimated is further supported by the finding       of Yadavendra and Witcombe (2013) [5.1] that more than 60% of farmers who       were given GM-6 seed more than once grew it in the following year and       increased the proportion of their land area sown to this variety       year-on-year.
Independent evidence for this large estimated land area       planted with GM-6 is provided by the principal maize research scientist at       the Main Maize Research Station, Gujarat Agricultural University, Godhra       who concluded from his observations that GM-6 is the most popular maize       variety in Gujarat, that it occupies a large majority of the maize area,       and that it has been grown on a cumulative area of 2M ha since its release       in 2002 [5.2].
Surveyed resource-poor farmers reported that cultivating GM-6 maize had       considerable positive impacts on their livelihoods with their maize seed       sales increasing by more than 50% and their household food supply lasting       for more than one additional month [5.1].
In addition, a majority of the       surveyed farmers growing GM-6 reported that it increased their total       income by 10-20%.
Given that, on average, resource-poor households in       Gujarat each own 0.9-1 ha of land, which is only partially planted to       maize, it is estimated that the cumulative 1.08 million ha of GM-6       planting during the six years 2008-2013 equates to the livelihoods of an       average of more than 2 million household-years (333,000 households per       year) directly benefitting from GM-6.
Using conservative estimates for       current value of maize grain and the estimated 30% yield advantage       obtained from cultivating GM-6 over other local varieties, GM-6 has       provided an additional harvest for farmers in Gujarat, Rajasthan and       Madhya Pradesh States of 360,000 t of food grain during 2008-2013 with a       net present value of Rs 5,600M (&#163;55M) [5.2, page 33], a major direct       impact on international development of the Bangor-led research that       created GM-6.
There are also good grounds for inferring substantial beneficial impacts       on the environment as the increased productivity of GM-6 is achieved       without the need for additional inputs, specifically water, inorganic N       and pesticides, thus reducing the burdens of water-consumption and       polluting agro-chemicals per amount of food production.
