     CRBS has generated impact in the following ways:     1.
Forging Scotland-wide links between university, local authority and         national collections of Burns-related material, thereby enhancing         cultural life and engaging civil society.
CRBS is a key member of Burns Scotland, formerly the Distributed National       Burns Collections Project, which was created in 2008.
Burns         Scotland &#8212; a partnership between UoG, the National Library of       Scotland, National Galleries Scotland, National Museums Scotland, Glasgow       Life, Dumfries and Galloway Museums and East and South Ayrshire Museums &#8212;       coordinates management of and promotes access to and appreciation of the       approximately 36,000 items relating to Burns in Scottish public       collections.
In 2008 Carruthers served as academic consultant to the Burns Scotland       exhibition Zig Zag: The Paths of Robert Burns, which displayed       Burns-related items and his writings in order to throw light on his       participation in the creation of his own myth.
Zig Zag attracted       52,991 visitors to venues in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dumfries and Aberdeen.
Since 2010 Carruthers has also chaired the Burns Scotland Research       Committee.
In 2012 Burns Scotland co-hosted the annual CRBS conference, Robert         Burns: Artefact, which attracted academic and non-academic Burns       enthusiasts from around the world, and included the display of       Burns-related treasures and performances of Burns-related music.
One-day       Burns conferences have been held annually by CRBS since 2007, each       attracting around 150 specialists and members of the general public from       the UK and abroad.
In 2011 CRBS's MacKay co-curated a series of exhibitions entitled Robert         Burns Beyond Text with the National Trust for Scotland and Glasgow's       Mitchell Library, designed to enhance public understanding of Burns's       contribution to the Scottish cultural landscape.
The project team also       developed the Mitchell's Treasure of the Month exhibition for January       2011, February 2011 and January 2013, during which time 120,258 people       visited the library.
The exhibitions displayed objects held in the       Mitchell's Burns collections, with notes pointing visitors to the UoG       Beyond Text website (Robert         Burns: Inventing Tradition and Securing Memory, 1796-1909), which       offers new perspectives on his writing.
As an example, among the objects       curated at the Mitchell were a number celebrating the link between Burns       and masculinity, with scenes from Tam o' Shanter depicted on items       associated with a range of `male' activities, including shaving (razor       hones) and smoking (snuffboxes) as well as drinking (whisky jugs).
The       work of UoG's researchers enhanced public understanding of how different       materials have helped to inform the cultural memory of this national       figure.
Impact was gauged using feedback forms, with almost 100% of       respondents finding the exhibition `interesting' or `very interesting'.
The Robert Burns Beyond Text exhibition was also hosted by the       Robert Burns Birthplace Museum in Alloway from March to April 2011, with       CRBS researchers working alongside the museum's curatorial and educational       staff.
UoG's research input, again in the form of notes and website,       underscored the exhibition's emphasis on the relationship between literary       and material culture, addressing questions such as whether the choice of       means of commemoration (through particular kinds of object or images of       Burns) had an effect on public perception of certain poems or on       approaches to the writer's life.
The museum drew 61,000 visitors during       the months of the exhibition.
CRBS also curated exhibitions for the       University of Dundee (March 2011) and for UoG's School of Scottish       Literature (May 2011) and Hunterian Art Gallery (November-December 2011).

Promoting access to Burns's work through events, online resources         and use of social and traditional media, enhancing public engagement and         creating cultural capital.
CRBS researchers have taken an innovative approach to textual editing,       combining online data, scholarly editions and a taxonomy of Burns-related       objects with song recordings and crowd-sourced information-gathering from       the Burns Federation and the wider collecting community.
In 2009-10 CRBS       worked with the BBC to create a permanent online         audio archive of Burns's works.
The publicly accessible archive       features recorded performances of 716 works by celebrities including       Robert Carlyle, Robbie Coltrane, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming, Liz Lochhead,       Phyllis Logan, Ian McDiarmid, Siobhan Redmond, Elaine C Smith, Alex       Salmond and the Prince of Wales.
The BBC producer describes embarking on       the project `armed with a Scots dictionary, and with Gerry Carruthers,       Director of the Robert Burns Centre at Glasgow University at the end of a       telephone or email to check any pronunciation or meanings' [see the BBC         Radio Scotland blog].
CRBS also commissioned a new work by Scottish composer James Macmillan in       2009 to mark the 250th anniversary of Burns's birth.
Macmillan chose to       set one of his `most beautiful and lesser known poems', and The Lament         of Mary, Queen of Scots had its premier in UoG's Bute Hall on 16       January 2009 with an audience of 300.
The concert included an additional       programme of Burns songs with arrangements by Haydn, responding directly       to a major new edition of Haydn's folksongs produced by UoG academics       Rycroft and Edwards (Music) and McCue (CRBS).
Following the international       conference Robert Burns 1759-2009 (2009), CRBS was approached by       the World Burns Federation to co-organise what turned out to be a       successful world record attempt to perform Burns's Auld Lang Syne       simultaneously in 41 different languages (2009) [see YouTube         video         link].
The Robert Burns 1759-2009 conference also provided a       platform to build important links with schools.
CRBS collaborated with       Scottish publisher Itchy Coo to organise a drawing and writing       competition, encouraging children and young people to respond to Burns's       work.
Hundreds of entries were received from schools throughout Scotland,       and about 100 children attended the awards presentation at the conference.
The digital resource from the Robert Burns: Inventing Tradition and         Securing Memory project went live in March 2011, and in that month       alone it received 3,262 hits, prompting correspondence from businesspeople       and surveyors as well as academics, and a chatroom on the World Burns       Federation website.
The digital resources had received a combined total of       over 24,700 hits by June 2013 (statistics provided by Webalizer version       2.01).
This research generated new interest in Burns's legacy, as       evidenced by the response from the press &#8212; e.g.
The           Herald, 14 March 2011 (`The myth of Burns's mystery muse is       exposed') &#8212; and in social media, with significant discussion of the       project on UoG's Twitter account.
The recent AHRC grant for Editing Burns for the 21st Century       resulted in the creation of a global blogsite       and social network for the worldwide community of Burns enthusiasts, which       attracted widespread media interest on its launch in July 2012 and had       received over 13,000 visitors by July 2013.
Performances of Burns songs in       various styles have been downloadable         on iTunes from the CRBS website since December 2012, and by October       2013 had been browsed 1,109 times and accessed 811 times.

Convening an international network of Burns organisations and         events that enhance understanding of his global influence.
Supported by CRBS, the Global         Burns Network (2008-09) was developed as an information exchange to       enhance understanding of the nature and scale of Burns's international       profile and influence.
To commemorate the 250th anniversary of his birth,       the Network hosted a `Countdown to 2009' page       disseminating information about a series of international events in the       USA, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Czech Republic,       Serbia and Russia.
One of these events was the Robert Burns 1759-2009       conference noted above, a three-day event hosted by CRBS.
The conference &#8212;       which was attended by 607 academics and members of the public &#8212; had a       strong outward-facing element, incorporating public talks and evening       performances, and offering a variety of speakers, papers and plenary       lectures.
It attracted significant media interest, including press (The         Herald, The Daily Mail, The Sunday Herald, The         Dundee Courier), radio (BBC Radio Scotland, Real Radio and Clyde       One) and television (BBC Scotland's Newsnight and STV News.
