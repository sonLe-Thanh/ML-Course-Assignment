     Kennedy's research advanced knowledge and good practice amongst       web designers to enable them to include people with ID in the World Wide       Web.
The impact of this research is summarised in the six points below,       which show how the research instigated and generated new practices,       influenced creative design processes and contributed to improved website       design for people with ID.
1.
Raised awareness about techniques for web accessibility for people         with ID amongst web designer research participants           Kennedy's research enhanced awareness and understanding of ID       accessibility and ID web users' needs amongst web designers, evidenced by       feedback from web designer participants:     "Prior to INMD, I had little if any understanding of ID accessibility       issues, though I had some awareness of general accessibility in web design       and development ...
I now feel I have a very good awareness of patterns of       use and issues that affect the use of the web by people with ID" [1].
The project report [2] includes these testimonies to this impact       from participants:     "The extensive testing on our shops with various user abilities had a       profound impact on me and showed me that what I took for granted wasn't       obvious to everyone and that we need to broaden our horizon" (design       agency director).
"I am more aware of accessibility issues and much more aware of the       extent of a diversity of people's uses of online media" (freelance web       developer/lecturer).
2.
Changed the practices of web designer research participants,         enabling them to enhance the ID accessibility of the websites they build     Web designer research participants took a number of actions to change       their web design practices and include web users with ID amongst their       audiences as a direct result of the research.
Participants reported       using recommended ID accessibility techniques to improve the ID       accessibility of their websites, including:            changing the way they use imagery, so it is more relevant to and         supportive of text;       using large fonts to enhance readability of text;       using simple text, or encouraging copy writers to do so, to enhance         readability of text;       beginning user testing at the start of a web design project;       building both rich media and plain text versions of webpages, to cater         for the accessibility needs of diverse populations of users;       re-visiting and improving previously built websites to enhance their         ID accessibility by implementing some of the techniques listed in the         above bullet points;       limiting choice on each page [2].
One said "I can confirm that my practice was changed by the experiences I       had at the INMD workshop.
[...] [I] gained awareness of specific       techniques such as simple navigation structures, visual communication and       the use of `easyread' texts that are fundamental to ID accessibility.
[...] I am now very aware of the importance of simple writing and       readability, and the use of images to support meaning in websites.
[...] I       might add that I have also communicated the importance of such practices       to many colleagues and collaborators" [1].
As a direct result of INMD, some participants also became members of       accessibility organisations such as GAWDs (Guild of Accessible Web       Designers), whilst others passed on information from INMD, through blogs       or at work, becoming accessibility experts in their workplaces, such as       large public sector organisations and media companies [2].
3.
Facilitated INMD web designer participants to undertake ID-targeted         web design     An unintended but welcome impact of Kennedy's research was that       participants went on to design websites targeted specifically at web users       with ID, putting into practice the research findings relating to the web       accessibility needs of this group of web users.
Three participants       contributed voluntarily to the production of the INMD website, designed       specifically with the accessibility needs of ID web users in mind, whilst       others developed prototype sites targeted at ID web users, such as a       website for the charity 1A Arts, a centre in London supporting local       children, young people and adults with ID.
As further examples, the       following projects were developed with The Rix Centre, a charitable       organisation committed to exploring the benefits of new media for people       with ID [3]:            ClickStart: template for people with ID to make their own websites, in         use by 10 London Boroughs and 240 trainee web information providers with         and without disabilities (www.clickstart.org.uk).
In-Folio: e-portfolio application for people with ID to record         material about their lives and experiences.
The In-Folio team won the         2011 Adobe Systems sponsored Learning Technologist of the Year Team         Award (http://www.jisctechdis.ac.uk/techdis/learnersandstudents/infolio).
Oily Cart: website for young people and people with ID theatre company         (www.oilycart.org.uk).
"These specific examples [...] show that the web was made more accessible       for people with learning/intellectual disabilities as a direct result of       INMD - web designers developed ID accessibility expertise on INMD and then       implemented this in the web design work they undertook.
Creative industry       professionals were effectively engaged in co-development of inclusive       design best practice on INMD and have genuinely embedded this knowledge in       practical ways that have direct impact for people with disabilities across       the UK" [3] (Director, The Rix Centre).
4.
Shared ID web accessibility expertise with other relevant         organisations     In addition to facilitating web designer research participants to work       with the national charity, The Rix Centre, the research also positioned Kennedy       and INMD collaborators as experts in this field.
Kennedy has acted       as a consultant and shared the research findings with charities dedicated       to improving the lives of people with ID, such as People In Action       and CHANGE.
"The expertise [...] shared with us around the development of websites       that are accessible for people with learning disabilities really supported       CHANGE to create a website that is more accessible to and       representative of our volunteers and staff who have learning disabilities.
You have supported us to develop a great platform for making the wider       community and other organisations more aware of the access needs of people       with learning disabilities" (Accessible Information Manager, CHANGE)       [4].
The Director of Cognable (an INMD collaborator) reports that INMD       directly led to him being asked to join a group of people working on a W3C       WAI Application Note (an appendix to its accessibility guidance) relating       specifically to the needs of web users with ID and that his "involvement       served to highlight the complex and diverse web accessibility needs of       people with cognitive and intellectual disabilities, a knowledge area       which had not been well represented in WAI historically."
Also, "as a       result of INMD, I was invited by the then Minister for Further Education       to join a UK government round table discussion on Accessibility of       Creative Digital Tools, at which I also promoted the accessibility needs       of people with cognitive and intellectual disabilities" [5].
5.
Advanced knowledge and good practice within a wider audience,         beyond the research project, through a website dedicated to sharing ID         accessibility techniques     The website www.inclusivenewmedia.org       was developed to share research findings, to advance knowledge and good       practice and to communicate ID web accessibility techniques.
It offers       comprehensive resources, including materials adapted from the research       findings and workshops and was developed in collaboration with the BBC's       Usability and Access Team.
Eleven members of this team beta-tested the       website, which raised awareness and advanced knowledge of ID accessibility       issues amongst a team responsible for ensuring BBC services are usable by       all users, including those with disabilities.
A survey of BBC       representatives following INMD revealed support for the research in       improving ID web accessibility: "Overall, an excellent summary of issues       of ID and great advice on how to improve sites to take into account those       who suffer from ID" (BBC Information Architect/Usability Consultant) [6].
As further evidence that the research has engaged a wide audience, the       INMD website received 250,000 hits within six months of its launch in       November 2009 and more than 200,000 hits in the following year.
Its       significance was noted by Eric Meyer, a widely-followed and prominent       world-leading web developer in October 2009, who commented that the work       is "important, and the more insights you can give us, the better" [7].
The website continues to serve as an ID accessibility resource,       consistently receiving 10,000 page hits per month.
As further examples of       engagement, Clearhelper, a US website sharing best practices of       accessibility for people with ID, shared the research findings [8],       and in March 2013, on SLD-forum, a Department for Education forum for       professionals working with people with ID, INMD was praised, in particular       the site's top tips [9].
6.
Raised the confidence of people with ID     A final impact of the INMD project was to raise confidence amongst people       with ID.
Twenty-nine people with ID took part in the research project as       website testers.
Ellingham Employment Services, through which they were       recruited, confirmed that: "participation in this project proved       beneficial to our service users, in terms of increasing their confidence,       self esteem and understanding of the work place.
[...] This was helpful in       building the participants' understanding of their own accessibility issues       and encouraging them to consider support needs.
[...] I have no doubt that       participation in the INMD project was extremely helpful for all the       service users who were involved, both in terms of personal development and       consolidating understanding" [10].
Therefore, although Kennedy's research did not include       longitudinal strategies to identify whether people with ID find the       websites that INMD participants make now more accessible than       those they made prior to INMD participation, this end user group       benefited from the research.
By concentrating on equipping professionals       and relevant organisations with the tools to improve the design of       websites, encouraging them to make the web more ID accessible, Kennedy's       research advanced knowledge and good practice amongst web designers to       include people with ID in the WWW.
