     Dr Sweetman's research on the Sparta Basilica, part of a larger project       on the churches of the late-antique       Peloponnese, involved a virtual reconstruction of the basilica complex.
That was       developed together with a pair of publications on the pedagogical       applications of virtual       reconstruction.
It was funded by an HEA grant of &#163;3000.
That work then       made possible the       development of a series of other virtual reconstructions by a team in the       School of Computer       Science working in consultation with Dr Sweetman and other colleagues in       St Andrews.
The next       reconstruction after the Sparta Basilica was St Andrews Cathedral (static       page at       https://vimeo.com/71629823).
Following a demonstration of the Cathedral reconstruction to Historic       Scotland, the team was commissioned to complete a reconstruction of       Linlithgow palace (which       had been started and abandoned by a commercial company).
Two further       reconstructions were       then completed independently by the project team in Computer Science       (Martyrs' Church, St       Andrews, and 1920s Harlem), and a further five in collaboration with SCAPE       Trust, which aims to       research, preserve and promote the archaeology of Scotland's coast (the       Trust is affiliated with       and partly funded by the University of St Andrews), and with a series of       museums both in Scotland       and in Iceland.
Those five are: the Brora Salt Pans and a medieval       settlement in Caen in       Sutherland, both on display in Timespan Museum and Arts Centre in       Helmsdale, Sutherland; the       sixteenth-century fort at Eyemouth, to be displayed in Eyemouth Museum;       the Fethaland Fishing       Station, to be displayed in the Shetland Museum; and a       tenth-century Icelandic Viking longhouse       in the Mosfell Valley.
The reconstructions are available online (http://openvirtualworlds.org/start/).
These       reconstructions have begun to make a substantial contribution to heritage       management,       public understanding and educational practice, in Scotland and beyond.

Heritage management and public understanding of Scottish and         classical history       The initial benefit of this work has been to heritage managers working in       Scotland and beyond.
The       work on Linlithgow Palace was supported by a &#163;3000 grant from Historic       Scotland (in addition to a       further grant from Education Scotland noted in section ii, below) in       recognition of its importance as       a model for the future accessibility agenda of Scottish tourism more       broadly.
The value of this work       for preserving community heritage has been recognised through funding       given by the Heritage       Lottery fund (&#163;60,000), MakeITHappen (&#163;17,000), and Historic Scotland       (&#163;10,000), allocated in       order to give the reconstructions permanent exhibition space in the       museums noted above.
Dr       Sweetman's initial research on the Sparta Basilica, with its innovative       use of virtual reconstruction,       and the subsequent extension of those techniques to other sites have thus       benefited heritage       managers in a range of institutions, helping them to further their goals       of increasing accessibility to       local archaeological material.
That work has also helped stimulate wider       dialogue about the future       directions of digital heritage management beyond the sites named above       through being exhibited       at the DigiDoc 2012 conference (a Historic Scotland event) to a mixed       audience (160) including       heritage managers.
Since completion, the reconstructions have also begun to make significant       contributions to       enhancing public understanding of the archaeological sites in question       among local communities       and tourists.
One striking development is the way in which the use of       gaming platforms in the       reconstructions (which can be accessed via game controllers and natural       movement) has       encouraged more enthusiastic engagement with local heritage from younger       visitors.
The       Timespan museum in Sutherland writes (source 1): `In Timespan,         we have been looking for ways         to attract new audiences to learn about our heritage, which can be         considered by some as a bit dry         and dusty and just for the older folk.
Here we have up to date         technology that children and young         adults are familiar with, regularly use and work with, so bringing our         heritage fully into the 21st       century...' According to Timespan, the availability of the       Longhouse reconstruction on their website       from June 2013 has contributed to an increase in traffic, with a 21%       increase in visitors during the       first month (2489 in June, from 2059 in May), an increase in average       session time from 2 to 4       minutes, and an increase from 38% to 59% in returning visitors.
Members of       the project held a       public event to launch the Caen reconstruction at the Timespan Museum in       May 2013: 100% of       those who filled in questionnaires (source 6) agreed or strongly       agreed with the statements `The       exhibit helped me imagine what it would have been like to live in Caen'       and `I would now like to find       out more about life in the Highlands'.
The launch was covered in one local       newspaper (the John         O'Groat Journal and Caithness Courier, 5/6/13) and two national ones       (The Herald, 28/5/13, and       The Scotsman, 25/5/13).
In addition, the reconstructions have       reached a wide public audience       through a series of one-off events for mixed audiences of children and       adults: MUSA museum, St       Andrews (January 2012, 60 visitors); Dundee Science Centre (March 2012,       1000 visitors); `Food       for Thought', St Andrews (June 2012, 800 visitors); `Across the Universe',       St Andrews (June 2013,       450 visitors); likewise through presentations at five non-academic       community archaeology       conferences in 2012: Highland Archaeology Fortnight; Tayside and Fife       Archaeology; Scotland       Community Heritage; East Lothian &amp; Borders Archaeology; Dunkeld       Community Archaeology.
At       all these events the reconstructions have been made available to visitors       for trial.
Visitor-book       comments from all these events were unanimously positive.
Many suggested       that the experience       had contributed to revising their perception of the sites, and many       expressed a desire to follow up       the experience by visiting the sites or by connecting to the       reconstructions from home.
Typical       comments include: `Kids were very interested and enjoyed being able to         interact with the cathedral.
The controllers...made it easy for them to do this'; `Fantastic         work.
Can't wait to visit St Andrews         again to look at the cathedral ruins' (from Dundee Science Centre, source         7) and `A fantastic         learning tool and great fun to use' (from Food for Thought, source         8).
Wider dissemination has       been achieved through local BBC and STV news coverage, following up on the       Food for Thought       event mentioned above (24/6/12), and through articles about the online       launch of the cathedral       reconstruction in both the Dundee Courier and the St Andrews Citizen       in July 2012 (source 9: `A       virtual time machine has been officially unveiled in St Andrews, allowing       the exciting opportunity to       explore the town's cathedral...[It is] intended to give users a new       perspective on Scottish history,       accessible across the generations').
The project websites had received       over 12,000 page views by       31/7/13, the Facebook page had 400 friends and had achieved a peak weekly       reach of 8000.     ii.
Education       The reconstructions have also begun to be used widely in Scottish schools.
Education Scotland       collaborated with Historic Scotland in their support for the Linlithgow       Palace reconstruction (see       above) by a grant of &#163;2450 in March 2012.
The Linlithgow Palace and St       Andrews Cathedral       reconstructions are hosted on the refurbished Education Scotland `Glow'       website which makes       them available as resources for all schools in Scotland.
The Glow website       is central to Education       Scotland's initiative on game-based learning within the Curriculum for       Excellence (CfE).
A       representative of Education Scotland writes (source 2): `We...see         this work as something that can         underpin a widening of interest in the historical tapestry of Scottish         schools and this experience         has helped raise the bar of aspiration for us...so much that we are now         looking to develop national         challenges that would see learners recreate [other] historical         sites...using tools such as Google         Sketchup or even Minecraft.
Over the past few years the Emerging         Technologies Team [at         Education Scotland] has gained a lot of recognition for its innovative         use of digital technologies to         enhance and enrich learning...The partnership of the team at St Andrews         University has been         invaluable in helping us maintain our presence in this domain and         without it we would have ended         this avenue of enquiry some time ago'.
The first three reconstructions (Sparta Basilica, St Andrews Cathedral,       and Linlithgow Palace)       have been used in seven schools (Linlithgow PS, Linlithgow Academy, Madras       College,       Strathkinness PS, Dundee High School, Glenrothes High School, Helmsdale       PS) in classes and       projects.
For example, the Cathedral reconstruction was used as the basis       for developing a Local       Unit of the CfE at secondary level at Madras College, St Andrews, in       2012-13.
It was launched in       October/November 2012 via a three-day event at the school, attended by 400       students, which       included talks and hands-on experience.
Students then visited the       Cathedral ruins and completed       assessment projects based on the reconstructions.
A representative of       Madras College writes       (source 3): `Rebecca's reconstruction had a positive impact on         pupils, teaching staff and the wider         community...The quality and quantity of work students have been doing in         their own time speaks of         how the Cathedral reconstruction has fired their imagination.
I haven't         known anything like it         before'.
The reconstructions are attractive to teachers because       learners are empowered by using       familiar technology, and because they are accessible to a range of age       groups and to students with       different learning requirements.
A representative of the Department of       Additional Support at       Glenrothes High School writes (in reference to his first experience of the       reconstructions while still       at Madras College) (source 4): `I took a group of DAS pupils in         to see the material and was struck         at how engaged they were with the format.
Many of these children with a         range of moderate         learning difficulties spend many hours on x-box and playstation so the         controls were recognisable         and posed far less threat than a pencil and paper...The pupils engaged         fully with the activity, and         the arrangement allowed for co-operative learning, good communication,         and was fun'.
That initial       experience led him to invite the project team to engage in further       collaboration after he moved to       Glenrothes.
The team spent two days there working with 40 students with       learning difficulties in       June 2013.
The DAS has agreed to be involved in a pilot project trialling       the use of the       reconstructions for its pupils during 2013-14.
A representative from the       High School of Dundee       writes (source 5) about a recent visit by Dr Sweetman: `The         virtual simulations engendered         discussions about how people would have behaved and felt, encouraging         pupils to approach their         studies with empathy and therefore a clearer understanding of their         forebears' motivation and         decision making...This year I have a group of boys who often appear         disengaged from their topic         studies and, perhaps understandably, would rather play football or         computer games.
Allowing them         the opportunity to combine their love of games technology and their         studies is a perfect solution...It         was pleasing to see their increased involvement with the content of the         lesson...The pupils could         better see the purpose of archaeological research with such a vivid and         visual method of         presenting them with the information'.
The reconstructions have also       been used outside class       teaching and project assignments.
For example, 200 school students from       Linlithgow Academy       were involved in an event in June 2012, organised in collaboration with       Education Scotland.
They       were filmed acting as tour guides in 16th-century costume and       placed within the Linlithgow       reconstruction using green-screen technology (http://vimeo.com/71629822).
The project has also       contributed to dialogue about future directions for virtual reconstruction       in education through       presentations at two major educational conferences: the Scottish       Association of Teachers of       History Conference (audience of 160) and IED Immersive Education, Paris       (60).
