     The research findings outlined above have cohered into a vital critique       that influenced the         development of national and international medical education policy and         practice.
In the UK,       it has had an important influence on medical and other higher education       professionals, with some       of its most significant impacts arising from the use of key research       findings by the General Medical       Council (GMC) &#8212; the most powerful body in UK medicine &#8212; and Royal College       of Physicians       (RCP), whose membership examination MRCP(UK) is taken by about 24,000       doctors worldwide       every year and is mandatory for those specialising in internal medicine.
In many cases, however,       its beneficial effects have resulted more generalised use to compel enhanced         transparency in the       operation of UK medical education professionals.
Postgraduate institutions such as the MRCP(UK) were, for many years,       extremely reluctant to       publish data about EM student performance because they believed that this       would impact       negatively on candidates' confidence in the fairness of the examination       and, in turn, on their own       reputations.
The publication in 2007 of [3] showed, on the contrary, that       transparency only       underlined institutions' commitment to equality.
In January 2008 the       MRCP(UK) decided to       routinely and systematically collect data about the ethnicity of all       candidates, examiners and       boards, and to publish outcomes by ethnicity [a].
As well as allowing the       UCL team's subsequent       statistical analysis disproving bias in individual clinical examiners [4],       this shift marked the       influence of the research on the running of the MRCP(UK) Examination.
Since 2011, the       same approach has been replicated by other Royal Colleges: data on EM       performance are now       routinely published by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) &#8212;       whose first publication       of exam results in 2008 attracted considerable media attention and who       explicitly cite our research       in their FAQs [b] &#8212; and by the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych),       the latter in relation to its       membership examination.
The Royal College of Physicians agreed in 2011 to       publish a publically-available 	  annual report on how gender and ethnicity relate to pass rates       on MRCP(UK) and       Specialty Certificate Examinations, again citing the UCL work in so doing       [c].
On 8th August 2012,       in a document that was "the first of its kind", the GMC published various       Royal College       postgraduate examination results by country of training and ethnicity       where available, with the       specific aim of "promoting transparency" and "ensuring training is fair       and based on principles of       equality".
In that document, the GMC responded to the incapacity of many       Royal Colleges to       provide ethnicity data by taking the unprecedented step of stating its       intention to work with them to       ensure its inclusion in future to facilitate analysis of ethnicity amongst       UK-trained doctors [d].
Beyond its specific influence on examination practice and the publication       of examination results,       the research has achieved significant impacts by stimulating and         informing debate among key         stakeholders and policy-makers in fields related to the provision       and regulation of medical       education.
The importance of the meta-analysis of research on EM       underperformance [9] to the       medical regulator was recognised explicitly by GMC Chief Executive Niall       Dickson in a BMJ       Careers article in March 2011.
Here, he wrote: "we will be looking closely       at [the study's] findings       and the implications for our role as the regulator for all stages of       medical education and training"       [e].
The study was subsequently included as a key reference for the GMC's       inaugural Being Fair       conference on 12th September 2012, where it was shared with       approximately 50 influential       stakeholders from policy-making and practitioner backgrounds.
In addition       to the inclusion of a       summary of the paper in all delegates' information packs, it was cited       explicitly by the GMC       Director of Education and Standards Paul Buckley, and discussed in detail       by participants in one of       the event's three workshop sessions [f, g].
Attendees at the conference,       which was chaired by the       Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman Dame Judie Mellor, included the       heads of the       GMC, Chair of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin,       Director of NHS Employers,       Chair of the Legal Services Consumer Panel, former Chair of the BMA       Equality and Diversity       Committee, postgraduate Deans, and medical directors of Primary Care       Trusts.
Underscoring the       study's relevance and utility to these diverse stakeholder parties, the       GMC Deputy Chief Executive       Peter Phillips drew on the findings summarised in delegates' packs to warn       that the GMC was       "losing the battle for hearts and minds" in delivering its statutory       purpose, partly because of "the       differences in outcomes and attainment rates for some groups of trainees       and doctors (men       compared with women, BME compared with their counterparts) in       examinations" [f].
The GMC       Chief Executive meanwhile, emphasised the need for "more analysis and       sharing of data to       understand what's happening, and to prevent problems occurring in the       first place"; he pledged to       analyse ethnicity data from the National Trainee Survey and Annual Review       of Competence       Progression (a summative assessment of all UK junior doctors) and publish       the results in 2013 [e].
Through these and other media, the research has been used to transfer         expert knowledge to         professional standards bodies and thereby contribute to         improving standards of         professional practise.
In September 2011 the GMC drew explicitly on       the underpinning research       in publishing its first report on `The state of medical education and         practice in the UK', which       acknowledges "unexplained differences in exam performance across all       domains, including       ethnicity", and recommends "further research to identify and address the       causes of these       differences" [h].
In the same month, the GMC's Undergraduate Board met to       discuss three major       proposals by the Medical Schools Council (the body representing the       interests of all UK medical       schools) to improve undergraduate medical assessment.
Again, the GMC       referred to the UCL       findings in advising that Council to include an assessment of the ethnic       equalities implications of       these projects [i].
On the basis of his expertise in this area, McManus       was invited to contribute to       the British Medical Association's 2009 report on Equality and Diversity in       UK medical schools [j].
In       2011 he was commissioned by the UKCAT consortium, who run the Clinical       Aptitude Test for       admission to 26 UK medical schools, to assess the test's validity in 4811       EM and non-EM       students, and to explore differences between medical schools in the       performance of EM students.
The impact of the research on the priorities of professional standards         bodies is further       evidenced by the GMC's October 2012 statement of its intention to include       an exploration of "the       complex reasons for the gap in attainment" set out in [9] in a       commissioned review of the effects of       Tomorrow's Doctors 2009, the document in which it had previously       outlined the knowledge, skills       and behaviours required of UK medical schools students [k].
On 5 th       March 2013, the GMC       commissioned an independent data review of pass rates of UK and non-UK EM       and non-EM       doctors taking the Membership of the Royal College of General       Practitioners exam, with UCL work       cited in the independent report and the GMC's subsequent Terms of       Reference review [l].
As well as engaging professionals involved in the provision of medical       education and maintenance       of professional medical standards with the sometimes uncomfortable       evidence pertaining to EM       underachievement, UCL research has also increased public awareness of         the ethnic         attainment gap.
This was, in fact, one of the researchers' original       aims: despite criticism for       making their findings public in the days before Royal Colleges routinely       published exam results on       their websites, they published their MRCP(UK) data in an open-access       journal in 2007 [3] precisely       in order to share its findings with a wide public audience.
The range of       the work's impacts on public       awareness of issues relating to EM underperformance &#8212; and of the need to       redress the problems       giving rise to that &#8212; has since been significantly expanded by       international media coverage.
That       medical practitioners themselves, both within and well beyond the UK, have       also engaged directly       with the research findings is evident in the 41 rapid responses on the BMJ       website from doctors       across the UK, Australia, Taiwan, Nepal and the USA to Woolf's 2011       meta-analysis and 2008       qualitative study; the articles were also discussed on medical websites       and blogs around the world.
The Maori Health Review in New Zealand, for example, described the 2008       study as "noteworthy",       adding: "The fact that teachers had the same negative `stereotypical'       ideas about `Asian' students       is somewhat unsettling, particularly if it impacts on knowledge transfer.
It also confirms the need for       clinical teachers to be culturally safe" [m].
