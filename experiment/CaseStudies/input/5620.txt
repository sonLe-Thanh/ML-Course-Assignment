     Screech's treatment of little-explored aspects of Japanese history, art       and culture makes him an       authoritative voice, especially on the Edo period (1603-1868), when Japan       was ruled by the       Tokugawa shogunate and characterised by strict social order and       isolationist foreign policies.
Many of Screech's works constitute the only available resources concerning       their subject matter,       thus their contribution to understanding of Japan cannot be       underestimated.
Screech's accessible and entertaining writing style makes his work       available to audiences beyond       academia, resulting in considerable impact on cultural life and       creativity.
Significantly, the       publications listed above proved invaluable sources for the celebrated       British novelist David       Mitchell.
Mitchell "relied extensively" on Screech's work to inform the       writing of his 2010 historical       novel The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet (1, 2, 3 and 4, below).
The novel, set at the turn of       the eighteenth century, depicts Dejima, the Dutch East India Company's       walled enclave in the       harbour of Nagasaki       (for almost two centuries, Japan's sole point of contact with the European       world), and tells the story of a Dutch trader's love for a Japanese       midwife.
Mitchell incorporates       into his novel numerous historical details, episodes and anecdotes       featured only in Screech's work       in order to afford it greater historical authenticity.
Specifically, he       drew much inspiration from       Screech's editions of the memoirs of two Dutch East India Company       employees, Carl Peter       Thunberg and Isaac Titsingh.
Although Mitchell does not fictionalise       either, his understanding of       the Edo period, and the complex encounter between East and West, owes much       to Screech's       lengthy introductions and highly detailed annotations.
Mitchell's novel was also heavily informed by two of Screech's       monographs: The Lens within the         Heart and The Shogun's Painted Culture.
A close reading of       these texts enabled Mitchell to       recreate the intellectual world of the rangakusha, the Japanese       scholars of European sciences and       arts.
A specific illustration of Mitchell's use of Screech's work is found       in Chapter Four of the novel       which features a description of bottles of pickled specimens outside the       State Room of the Dutch       East India Company in Dejima (pp.
37-8).
These bottles, never before       mentioned in scholarly work,       figure prominently in Screech's analysis of medical and scientific       exchange in The Lens within the         Heart.
Additionally, Mitchell's depiction of a Nagasaki brothel was       very much inspired by Screech's       Sex and the Floating World.
Mitchell himself, though never having met Screech, is frank about his       "intellectual and imaginative"       indebtedness to his publications, and explicitly attests to influence:     "He is the kind of academic interpreter of history and ideas upon whom         more popular interpreters         (lower down the food chain) rely (...).
In my opinion, nobody else is         doing what Professor Screech         does: making accessible to interested non-specialists         (like me), via primary research, areas of         Japanese and East Asian culture which would otherwise lie buried, just         as the Titsingh and         Thunberg memoirs languished in untranslated antiquarian obscurity for         two centuries until his work         appeared (...).
Nobody else I know of possesses so deep a knowledge of         the Tokugawa period &#8212; its         arts, economics, politics, religion trade, popular culture, its view of         itself &#8212; and writes about this         milieu so accessibly, and with such authority and verve."
Mitchell's use of Screech's pioneering scholarship was also recognised in       a review of the novel in       the London Review of Books, in which Screech is quoted as an expert       on the `cultural collision' that       took place in the unique context of the walled Dutch port of Dejima (5).
To date, Mitchell's novel has sold in excess of 200,000 copies in over 15       languages, with a       Japanese edition appearing in 2013.
The novel won the Commonwealth Prize       for Literature 2011       (South Asia and European prize) (6), was longlisted for the Man Booker       Prize 2010 (7), and       shortlisted for the Walter Scott Prize for Historical Fiction 2011 (8).
It       was named among the books       of the year by The Time, The Washington Post, The Financial Times, The         New Yorker, The Globe         and Mail, and The New York Times.
It has also featured on       several English literature university       course reading lists, including Surrey (9) and Oxford (10).
Mitchell's use of Screech's research is noteworthy in its illustration of       how research can inspire and       inform a much-lauded work of literary expression, enriching it with       historically accurate detail and       enabling an under-studied period to be brought to life.
As Mitchell       himself states, "Had I tried to       write The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet 15 years earlier,       before Professor Screech's work       was published, it would have been an impoverished novel by comparison."
