     Brown's research has generated new ways of thinking and speaking about       theatre sound and changed its status as a professional creative practice.
Its impact may be seen in the practices of sound designers, their       professional organisation, the approaches of directors and       equipment manufacturers, training within industry and the       emergence of a specialist academic discipline.
Evidence comes from       institutions across the world.
The steps towards these impacts began with creating formal opportunities       for industry discourse.
These laid the foundation for establishing the       professional status of theatre sound.
Crucially, Brown's early research       was embedded in creative practice in professional settings.
This gave him       authority within the profession (a review of one show pinned over the       sound desk at the National Theatre studio).
Building on his standing as       practitioner Brown convened a sound design colloquium in 2002 (sponsored       by Central, the National Theatre and the International Organization of       Scenographers, Theatre Architects and Technicians (OISTAT)), at which sound         designers and academics from 13 countries heard Brown       present his idea of `dramaturgy of sound' (source A).
Inspired by the       implications of the research two designers, Steve Brown and Rick Thomas,       invited Brown to help set up a Sound Working Group (SWG) of OISTAT, as a       vehicle for promoting the new thinking about sound.
They strategically       located SWG within OISTAT's Scenography Commission as `artistic' rather       than `technical' practice, achieving the first inclusion of sound design       in a scenography exhibition (Prague Quadrennial 2003), leading to       significantly increased profile at Prague 2007.
The 2002 colloquium also       drew equipment manufacturers into the project of elevating sound:       d&amp;b audiotechnik describe how they became involved in the planning of       sound design exhibits (source C1).
In 2013 a second colloquium, at the       Lyttleton Theatre, was curated by emerging designer Donato Wharton, who       learnt his trade within Brown's conceptual framework.
This research has helped change the ideas and practice of five       groups of people.
Among professional sound designers leading       designer Paul Arditti notes that `Ross's academic research can be       provocative' (source C2), which Finnish designer Kristian Ekholm expands       on: `The contexts in which sound designers have to work [are] rapidly         changing...
This means sound designers have to ... be able to think         laterally and in an innovative way, and not be constrained by orthodox         approaches.
Brown's book provides ... strategies for thinking outside         the box.
There is very little other published theory ... on the         aesthetics and the ways in which sound works in relation to dramaturgy         and the specific live contexts of conceptual theatre sound design, and         his holistic view of theatre sound has made a huge impact on me'       (source C3).
Among directors Nancy Meckler and Jonathan Holloway both learnt       new approaches to sound.
Holloway says: `This research undoubtedly         changed the ways in which I worked with sound and music, and was of         influence to sound designers and composers with whom I have subsequently         worked' (source C4).
Most recently the artists' group Platform-7       took inspiration from Brown's work in staging their remembrance event, Silent         Cacophony, on London's Underground network (source B).
Equipment manufacturers d&amp;b audiotechnik state that their own       practice was taken forward by Brown's research: `dialogue with ... Brown,       as a researcher in the field, in relation to our research and development       agenda ... provides us with useful stimulus.'
This then had impact on       relations of industry and HE: `Our subsequent involvement on many industry       projects together bears testament to the advantage of academic and       industry co-operation' (source C1).
Among industry trainers the Royal Court's Head of Sound, David       McSeveney, uses Brown's book in training all his new staff.
One such is       Helen Skiera: `chapters and subjects were revealed that began informing         my practice.
[I]n reading the work, I became aware of other sound         designers and theatre practitioners describing their own work in         conceptual terms, rather than purely practical; and really for me, this         is the first time that I was aware that this really existed' (source       C5).
Finally, sound design teachers and students across the world are       being influenced by Brown.
Sound is a standard text on dramaturgy       of sound in UK universities and used heavily outside the UK: `almost every       MA-thesis in our department contains at least one citation from your book'       (Jari Kauppinen, Theatre Academy of Finland, source C6).
Professor Rick       Thomas, Purdue University, says: `I consider ... Sound to be one         of the most significant contributions to the field of theatre sound         design and composition....
It is required reading in the Graduate MFA         program in theatre sound at Purdue University, as it is at several other         prominent theatre sound programs in the United States' (source C7).
At Carnegie Mellon academic and professional designer Joe Pino says Sound's       impact on him was equal to that of Cage's Silence: it `has been         pivotal in providing a much needed matrix with which to analyze,         evaluate and understand the Art of sound design' (source C8).
