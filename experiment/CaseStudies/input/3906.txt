     The REWIND databases (http://www.rewind.ac.uk       &amp; http://www.rewind.ac.uk/rewind/index.php/I-chi_siamo)       are now established as a significant resource for curators, artists,       researchers, students, and teachers.
Interest and enquiries are regularly       received from scholars and students researching the period and the work       from all over the world; from journals and publications commissioning       articles; and from curators planning exhibitions and screenings (e.g.
26       curatorial enquiries from 8 countries 2012-13).
The University of Dundee       IT Services Access Report run on 13th October 2013 [1] revealed that since       1st January 2008, the site(s) had received &gt;1.2M hits with 43,875       downloads of individual files (the video interviews and PDF files).
This       is the most significant figure as casual visitors do not download 1-3 hour       interview files or their transcriptions.
Around 35% of the requests were       from UK domains, and 10% from .com domains.
The geographic spread is       extensive, with visits and file requests from every continent and 93       countries.
The Rewind collection numbers 450 works with 150 installations       documented, and has been consulted by curators who have used the archive       and collection for their own exhibitions [2,3,4,5,6] and has resulted in       the restoration of many artists and their works to the international       canon.
A REWIND Facebook Page was established in 2011 for up-to-the minute       news and associated events       (http://www.facebook.com/RewindItalia)       and is followed by a community of 500-2000 people per week.

David Hall's re-mastered and developed "7 TV pieces" undertaken by       DJCAD archivist Adam Lockhart, was purchased by Museo Nacional Centro de       Arte Reina Sof&#237;a, Madrid as part of a new collection of seminal works by       Viola, Paik et al., and in 2012 this was shown as part of Hall's solo       exhibition End Piece, at Ambika P3 London; Kevin Atherton's       re-mastered "In 2 Minds" video-work, (also undertaken by Lockhart)       resulted in invitations to new presentations at TATE Britain, Ireland and       Europe and considerable new curatorial interest in this artist; in 2011       REWINDItalia recovered and re-mastered the long-lost video works of       Luca Patella, which immediately gained attention and screenings across       Italy, including MACRO, Roma (2012 and 2013) and the Venice Bienalle       (2012).
Street Level Gallery Glasgow curated a one-man show on John       `Hoppy' Hopkins directly as a result of the REWIND research, one of the       most popular shows the Gallery has undertaken according to the Director,       restoring this important 1960s photographer, activist and artist to       attention.
[3]     The expertise, both curatorial and technical, gained through the project       has allowed the team to provide archival and practical advice and       assistance to other institutions/galleries such as Glasgow School of Art       on the `Third Eye Centre Archive' 2012; Raven Row Gallery/Flat       Time House, London 2011 on the `APG Documentation Archive'; and       Ambika P3, for David Hall's `End Piece' exhibition, 2012.
The impact of REWIND has also been sustained through externally curated       exhibitions including:     Artists' Video in the 70s &amp; 80s, doggerfisher gallery,       11 Gayfield Sq, Edinburgh, EH1 3NT, 30th September - 25th October 2008.

[8]     David Hall's End Piece, Ambika P3, London,       March-April 2012, curated by Michael Maziere featured 3 works from       the collection and a new commission based on a 1971 work 101 TV sets       celebrating the switch-off of the analogue broadcast signal in London to       wide acclaim by the public and press.
This was a major solo exhibition by       David Hall, the influential pioneer of video art, featuring a monumental       new commission '1001 TV Sets (End Piece)' 1972-2012, comprising 1,001       cathode ray tube TV sets, of all ages and conditions, which filled the       massive Ambika P3 subterranean space alongside the restaging of two       seminal early works.
The exhibition vividly heralded the end of analogue       TV in the UK as London finally switched to digital on 18th April 2012.
Partridge       advised on the curation and Lockhart was the technical director       for the install.

[10]     Scratch Video, Street Level 2009 and Dundee Contemporary       Arts, Cinema 2, Tuesday 1st April 2008.
A screening of a series of videos       from the 'Scratch Video' genre that was prevalent in the 1980s and has       generally been forgotten about in contemporary culture.
This led to a       week-long exhibition at the Street Level Gallery in 2009.
[3].
This genre       was the first to use samples of video and mix them with sampled music and       sound, leading into the dance music generation of the early 1990s.
Artists       featured: George Barber/Kim Flitcroft &amp; Sandra Goldbacher/Jeffery       Hinton/The Duvet Brothers/John Scarlett-Davis/John Maybury/Gorilla       Tapes/Akiko Hada &amp; Holger Hiller/Chris Meigh-Andrews/Nick Cope.
Followed by a restaging of the Duvet Brothers Multi-Screen piece, as a       Live Performance in November 2010 at the Visual Research Centre, DJCAD.
This has had an impact on art culture in the UK with the nomination of       Elizabeth Price for the 2012 Turner Prize, George Barber interview in       Frieze Magazine (2011), and the resurgence of `Scratch' video in general.
