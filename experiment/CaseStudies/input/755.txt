     Our research is concerned with identifying optimal pre-competition       strategies that can be exploited for performance gain by elite       sportspeople.
In the context of elite sport, the smallest of margins can       often make the difference between winning and losing.
Swansea University       researchers, led by Dr. Kilduff in collaboration with UK Sport, have       generated the key research findings underpinning this work.
More       specifically these findings provided the basis for current preparation       strategies for a number of top European professional rugby teams (e.g.
Scarlets &amp; Biarritz Rugby), elite winter (e.g.
British Bobsleigh and       Skelton Bobsleigh) and summer Olympic sports (e.g.
British Cycling Team)       and contributed to their recent successes at Vancouver Winter and London       Summer Olympic games.
Practitioners who work in the area of applied sports       physiology and strength &amp; conditioning have also benefitted       significantly from this work by applying these findings into their       pre-competition strategies - quotes cited below will bear testament to       this.
Furthermore, due to the involvement of UK Sport in all of this work,       it was received by a significantly wider elite sport audience in the years       leading into the London 2012 and is now also being incorporated into       Winter Sports leading into Sochi 2014 and Rio 2016.
The work on the application of PAP and warm-up carried out at Swansea       University has changed the pre-competition routines of a large number of       key sporting organisations that compete at the highest level of sport.
In       summary, this work has directly impacted and now become embedded in the       pre-competition preparation routines of British Bobsleigh, British       Skeleton Bobsleigh, British Cycling, Welsh Swimming, Scarlets Rugby,       Biarritz Rugby Teams.
Director of Marginal Gains, British Cycling:     "This letter is in support of the impact Dr. Kilduff sports science         research has had on our preparation strategies within British Cycling.
Dr. Kilduff's research around the application of Postactivation         Potentiation (PAP) to elite athletes and in particular determining the         optimal time between the PAP stimulus and the subsequent performance has         allowed the "Marginal Gains Team" to gain a greater understanding of the         role PAP plays in improving starts in elite cycling and has made a         contribution to subsequent improvements in cycling performance.
We now         incorporate PAP into a number of our athletes pre- competition warm-ups.
In addition to PAP his work with Dr Christian Cook (UK Sport) on         maintaining body temperature between the completion of the warm- up and         subsequent race has allowed GB cyclists to minimize the problem of heat         loss within their warm-up routines resulting in further marginal gains         in elite performance.
These marginal gains are key to continued success         in international cycling competition.
Dr Kilduff's research has had         important significance and impact on our current practice at British         Cycling".
Lead Sport Science, Great Britain Bobsleigh     "Dr Kilduff's research on Postactivation Potentiation (PAP), passive         heat maintenance and morning priming has allowed us to dramatically         change our preparation routines which we feel has had a positive impact         on our performance over last season and we will be continuing with these         routines into Sochi 2014.
In the 2012/13 season GB World Cup crews made         improvements on 50m start time in a range from 0.04 seconds (women) to         up to 0.12 seconds (men).
This had a dramatic impact on overall         performance and end ranking.
We will be continuing in this line of         research and development to find as much physical advantage in the push         start as we can.
The primary research was a highly significant step         towards a performance shift.
Some of the secondary research planned         around new findings and results of implementation ... also holds         exciting prospects.
Dr Kilduff's research has important significance and         impact of our current practice at British Bobsleigh and we feel this         will be a very important part of our preparations in Sochi 2014."
Furthermore, our work around passive heat maintenance has also impacted       key winter and summer Olympic sports:     Director of Research and Innovation, UK Sport stated:     "The impact you have delivered on the wider area of warm up,         potentiation and `competitive readiness' in elite athletes has directly         impacted on applied practice and performance with particular emphasis on         GB's winter sport programmes.
Part of the research work carried out in         this group in preparation for Vancouver 2010 has recently been published         in the International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance         (Designing a warm-up protocol for elite bob-skeleton athletes)."
In a press release the Director of Research and Innovation for UK Sport       also wrote (following the successful performance of one of the female       skeleton athletes at the Vancouver games)     "Dr. Kilduff and his team have supported us specifically in aiding the         skeleton athletes' physical performance.
Dr. Kilduff and his team worked         closely with members of British Skeleton and the English Institute for         Sport, on a number of strategies looking that optimized their         preparation strategies".
