     The research presented in this case study has multiple impacts.
First, on       institutions and professionals delivering health services; and second, on       individuals, particularly mental health service users, engaging in arts       and health projects.
This impact is evidenced in a number of ways.
1.
Arts and mental health     In the context of initiating change in the delivery and understanding of       arts and mental health services, an indicator of the significance of the       impact of Rowe's research is the sustained partnership with Leeds and York       Partnerships NHS Foundation Trust around Converge.
In 2013 the Trust is       contributing a total of &#163;20,500 toward Converge practice and research,       including part- funding a PhD student to work alongside the project from       2013-17.
This is an indication of recognition from a major mental health       provider that Converge is an excellent example of contemporary       recovery-orientated mental health work.
The Trust also provides a senior       occupational therapist to provide clinical support, as well as funding an       occupational therapist to support service users to progress through arts       activities provided by Converge.
The Trust's recent `transformation plan'       for mental health services in York includes mention of Converge as a       partner provider.
Converge has impacted through public performances undertaken by Out of       Character, a theatre company consisting of mental health users, and the       Converge Choir.
These include:            May 2010: Out of Character performance at The Living and Learning,           Learning and Teaching: Mental Health in Higher Education         Conference organised by National Mental Health in Higher Education at         Lancaster University.
July 2010: Out of Character performed Tales from Kafka at York         Theatre Royal to approximately 400 people over 4 nights.
June 2012: Out of Character performed Henry IV by Luigi         Pirandello at York Theatre Royal to approximately 300 people over 3         nights.
May 2013: Out of Character performed their autobiographical show Speaking           Ourselves at the launch of the York Early Intervention unit for         psychosis.
September 2013: Out of Character performed Speaking Ourselves         at the National Richmond Fellowship Conference in York.
May 2013: The Converge choir was invited to perform at the launch of         the York Early Intervention unit for psychosis and in September 2013 it         performed at the National Richmond Fellowship Conference in York.
October 2013: Out of Character performed to nursing students at York         University.
Audience feedback from these events include the comment, `Inspirational,       actions are more powerful than words, which adds a creative dimension to       mental health understanding and getting a range of messages across a wide       audience.'
The second strand of impact is at the very significant level of       individuals participating in the Converge project.
This has made a       significant impact on mental health service users in the York area.
In       2011-12, 84 people who use mental health services completed Converge       courses and the project achieved an 82% retention rate, which indicates       the value that participants put on the experience in transforming their       mental wellbeing.
As Chris Butler, Chief Executive of Leeds and York NHS       Trust writes, Converge `gives people with mental health problems the       opportunity to explore and develop their creativity.
For people with       mental health problems it can be difficult to have the confidence to       explore existing strengths or to discover new abilities and talents.
Service users described how this had simply transformed their lives       enabling them to achieve goals that at one time seemed impossible to       reach' (5.1).
Other corroborations of impact include that from the Joseph       Rowntree Foundation (5.2).
Through dissemination events, Rowe's research has impacted on arts and       mental health practice, informing delivery in this area.
As John White,       Pacific University, USA, writes, `Participants learned about theatre work       with people who use mental health services and discussed ways to       incorporate Nick's ideas into work with other populations.
The       presentation emphasized methods through which community organizations and       educational institutions can work together for the benefit of community       members and university students' (5.3).
Converge has also provided a case       study for the National Co-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement         (5.4) and the International Health Humanities Network (5.5).
2.
Arts in hospitals     Research conducted with the medical team at York Hospital was designed to       explore patients' perceptions of engaging in arts work in a renal dialysis       unit.
The research has impacted on the development of arts practice in       York Hospital.
Dr Colin Jones, consultant on the renal dialysis unit at       York Hospital reports that the research into the impact of arts in a       hospital environment has `Increased people's realisation that the project       was transformative and enabling rather than just a "bit of pampering" and       that it has decreased cynicism amongst key players in the hospital and       helped with funding bids.'
The development of art work at the Colon-rectal       unit is evidence of wider acceptance of arts approaches for in-patients at       the Hospital (5.6).
3.
Performing personal stories in playback theatre     In the context of Playback theatre, the original publication Playing         the Other, also translated into Korean and Arabic, is a key text       used significantly beyond the HE sector for drama practitioners,       dramatherapists and health workers using drama in therapeutic settings.
In       a review in Theater Journal, Linda Park-Fuller writes:     `With this book, Nick Rowe substantially addresses two lines of scrutiny       facing those who work with improvisational, audience-interactive, or       auto/biographical theatre: (1) the need to theorize the work's theatrical       values, and (2) obligations for the ethical deployment of materials that       come raw from everyday life.
He does this by rigorously testing, then       blurring the binaries that undergird these dual demands.
To illustrate       requires a review of playback theatre (PT) and an introduction to Rowe's       background and purpose'.
(5.7)     The impact of the work is also evidenced through a range of `playback       theatre' dissemination activities given across a range of beneficiaries.
Specific examples include:     a) Presentation at the Developing Partnerships Conference, Middlesbrough       (2009)     b) Playback Theatre in the Young Persons' Detention Centre, Wetherby,       Yorkshire (2008)     c) Playback theatre in the Asylum Seekers' Centre, Middlesbrough (2009)     d) Playback Theatre performance for General Practitioner trainers in the       North of England (2011).
