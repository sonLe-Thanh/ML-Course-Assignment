     Attachment-based clinical interventions     We have translated our research findings into major new clinical       programmes with direct impact on the lives of children and families.
For       example, our Parent-Infant Psychotherapy programme (PIP),       developed at the AFC, supports parents in understanding and responding       sensitively to their baby's needs, thereby promoting the development of       secure attachments.
This programme was initially set up in 2005-8,       supported by Big Lottery funding (&#163;206,000).
In the period 2008-13, it has       been delivered to 1,733 vulnerable mothers and infants in the UK including       mothers with postnatal mental health problems in deprived London       communities, mothers who are homeless and seeking asylum (funded by       Rowntree), and mothers with severe psychiatric problems [a].
In       2008, the home office provided funding of &#163;114,000 to extend the PIP       programme to mothers in four UK Prisons [b].
The programme is       recommended by the Department of Education as an evidence-based       intervention for parents and infants under one year of age experiencing       difficulties in the parent and baby relationship [c].
Based directly on our work, colleagues at Yale University developed the Minding         the Baby (MTB) programme, which is designed to promote parental       reflective functioning (RF) [d].
MTB supports the mother to       develop her capacity to think about what is happening in her baby's mind,       which helps her to respond sensitively, improving the quality of their       relationship.
Since 2008, MTB has supported 133 impoverished mothers in       the US.
In 2010 a training institute was created and 67 clinicians from       the US and Europe have attended so far [e].
Recently we initiated a new partnership with the NSPCC to support the       development and evaluation of Minding the Baby for highly vulnerable       families in the UK.
This five-year programme involves delivery of a       comprehensive home visiting package to 320 high-risk families in three UK       cities.
By July 2013, 105 families had so far benefited from the       programme.
The Head of Strategy &amp; Development at the NSPCC reports the       impact of our work as follows:     "Fearon and Fonagy have made an important and distinctive contribution         to national policy in the field of early years intervention and         prevention... Their developmental approach has influenced the policy         narrative around the importance of sensitive and critical periods for         intervention across different stages of early childhood.
They have         advocated effectively for an attachment perspective and clearly         articulated the importance of parental sensitivity as a key predictor of         child outcomes of interest to policy makers.
The impacts of this work         can be very concretely seen in policy documents such as the NSPCC's         highly influential report `All Babies Count' which received wide acclaim         amongst policy makers...
The Unit has also had a significant impact on         practice.
Fonagy and Fearon have delivered training in early child         development and attachment to almost all of the NSPCC's workforce of         social workers, psychologists and midwives delivering services to         babies.
Their work has also been highly influential on shaping NSPCC's         strategy and pioneering programme of new services for babies and their         families.
All of the new services are influenced by a strong attachment         perspective and several have integrated a very explicit focus on the         role of maternal reflective function as a protective factor against         abuse and neglect" [f].
Using a related model of intervention, we have worked with a team in       Ethiopia to train mothers with malnourished infants in an attachment-based       intervention, Play Therapy.
It has been shown that malnutrition impacts       negatively on the quality of the parent-child attachment relationship, and       has serious physical, social and emotional consequences.
This intervention       aims to improve the mother's reflective function so that she can provide       appropriate emotional stimulation to her child.
The intervention helps       mother and child re-engage and has been found to facilitate children's       weight gain and faster discharge from hospital.
Mothers are trained by       local volunteers in the community.
Since 2010, local youths have been       trained and in turn have trained 191 mothers in the intervention.
The       results have been presented to the Ethiopian Health Minister, and Play       Therapy is to be rolled out to wider populations in East Africa severely       affected by drought [g].
Measurement tools     We have developed a range of specialised measurement instruments that are       now widely used by clinicians to assess attachment and reflective       function, including the Reflective Functioning (RF) scale, the Story Stem       Assessment Profile (SSAP) and the Child Attachment Interview (CAI).
Our       courses in the administration and coding of these measures have been       attended by more than 500 active clinicians aiming to use the instrument       for their clinical assessments and court reports.
We have also provided       training to over 100 NSPCC practitioners (2012, 2013) and two County       Councils (Portsmouth and Buckinghamshire in 2011, 2012 and 2013) involved       in preventing child maltreatment.
We have also run numerous clinical       training courses in our attachment-based interventions that have been       attended by more than 400 practitioners since 2008 [h].
These measures are now frequently used in child care proceedings by       social workers needing to advise Child Protection Services and the Courts       about the quality and safety of placements.
The CAI is recognised as the       best instrument available for evaluating the quality of the bond between       child and parents or foster-parents.
Examples of Boroughs which use the       instrument include Southwark, Surrey and Fife [i].
The Clinical       Lead for the Family Assessment and Safeguarding Service and the Infant       Parent Perinatal Service (IPPS) at Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust       (which provides various services in Buckinghamshire, Wiltshire and Bath       and North East Somerset, as well as in Oxfordshire) reports the following       regarding the impact of our research on their services:     "It would be difficult to overstate the contribution the         ground-breaking research conducted at UCL in attachment and in         particular reflective function has had on our services...
It has         profoundly influenced the design of our clinical services... Crucially,         the research and trainings provided have equipped us with effective         measures that allow for accurate assessment in both Court and clinical         cases and to measure outcomes following our treatment programmes" [j].
Influencing Policy     In part as a result of our work, the need to assess the quality of       children's attachments and intervene to promote attachment in order to       deliver best outcomes in the health and social care of young children is       now broadly accepted in the UK.
We have influenced policy through academic       publishing of policy-relevant papers, talks at major national policy and       practice conferences and direct engagement with policy-making.
Our       research contributed directly to Frank Field's government inquiry into       Early Intervention and the Scottish Government's National Risk Framework       to support the assessment of children and young people.
We have also       recently presented to the Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove,       and his Early Years Minister Liz Truss, to inform policy regarding infant       attachment and its long-term consequences for children's life chances.
We       also advise the parliamentary Foundation Years Action Group [k],       led by Frank Field and have been visited by a South Korean Assembly       delegation who were seeking advice on how attachment interventions can be       implemented to reduce aggression in schools [l].
In July 2013,       Fonagy was appointed as chair of the NICE Guideline Development Group on       attachment and the care of Looked After Children and adoptees, a group to       which Fearon has also been appointed [m].
