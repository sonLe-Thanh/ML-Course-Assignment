     The impact of this research is on health and welfare of rabbits and       policy with regards advice given to pet owners.
This research provided       evidence that the commonly fed and widely available muesli-type foods       cannot be recommended for pet rabbits, and has led to widespread publicity       from vets, petfood manufacturers and retailers, and animal welfare       organisations including the RWA, PDSA and RSPCA, to stop the feeding of       muesli to rabbits and promote better nutritional advice.
It led to       large-scale removal of muesli-type diets from sale.
In summary:            Major petfood Retailer Pets at Home have withdrawn muesli-diets from         their shelves and their CEO Nick Wood has written personally to more         than 25 of his counterparts in the retail sector asking them to de-list         muesli-style foods [5.1]       Extensive On-line coverage in the veterinary press [5.2-5.4]       Extensive media coverage including articles in The Daily Telegraph,         The Daily Express, The herald, The Scotsman, The People, Telegraph and         Argus [5.5]       Included as a major campaign for Rabbit Awareness Week (RAW) in May         2013, an annual campaign run by a partnership including the RSPCA, PDSA,         Wood Green Animal Charity and the Rabbit Welfare Association and Fund         [5.6].
