     i) Increasing public debate of issues of gender, social inclusion,         power relations and the ethics of spectatorship through widely         distributed DVDs     As a result of their engagement with Cinesexuality, four       directors and producers invited MacCormack to appear talking about the       themes that were addressed in Cinesexuality on DVDs intended for a       wide public audience.
These films are often associated with issues of       violence, masculinity and are rarely perceived through a feminist frame.
Because of MacCormack's participation, viewers of these DVD extras were       impacted by radically alternate ways of thinking about (i) meanings within       the films and (ii) how they watched these films in relation to gender and       power dynamics.
The DVDs included:            The 13 films of Jean Rollin (2009, 30,000+ unit sales), and Burke           and Hare (2010, 2000 unit sales) and Daughter of           Darkness (2010, 3000 unit sales) from Redemption Films (UK and US         distribution);        Suspiria (2009) Nouveaux Pictures release (UK and US         distribution, 1400 unit sales, UK and European distribution);        Video Nasties: The Definitive Guide (2009) (UK, US and         Australian Distribution, repeat screenings on The Horror Channel, 5000+         unit sales).
This DVD has the additional impact of reflecting upon and         affecting future censorship debates and regulation;        Maitresse (BFI, 2012).
(UK distribution, approx.
UK sales 2000         units).
ii) Challenging public understanding of stereotypes of gender and         desire by drawing (in art practice and script consultancy) on Cinesexuality       's address to the shift from spectatorship as dialectic to baroque     MacCormack's was commissioned, on the basis of Cinesexuality, by the       Whitechapel Gallery in London to act as script consultant on the Gonda       film project, directed by Ursula Mayer (2009).
This film premiered on 12       April 2012.
(http://www.art-agenda.com/reviews/ursula-mayer%E2%80%99s-gonda/).
MacCormack wrote the script for the second part of the Gonda trilogy,       Pheres.
This was filmed in October 2012.
MacCormack's script drew on       philosophical ideas from Cinesexuality to reorient traditional       concepts of the relationship between gender, performance, image and       identity that directly ask the audience to become accountable for their       own practices of spectatorship, the key claim which underpins Cinesexuality.
Gonda has been downloaded 12,000 times and Pheres has been       downloaded 5000 times.
Pheres is still showing as an installation       at 21er Haus in Vienna (13 Oct 2013 -12 Jan 2014) so viewer numbers are       rising       (http://www.euromuse.net/en/exhibitions/exhibition/view-e/ursula-mayer).
iii) Increasing public understanding of concepts related to feminism,         cinema and the social impact of art through public lectures     MacCormack increased public understanding of the above issues through a       series of public talks, including the lecture series at Treadwells, and       through participation in public arts festivals.
Treadwell's is a London bookshop that specialises in esoteric books, and       for 10 years has been running workshops, events and public lectures that       draw participants from all walks of life and all areas.
Past presenters       have included academics and students but also politicians, people in legal       studies, art practitioners, activists and others.
Treadwell's aims to draw       together those who would not ordinarily converge to share ideas and       disseminate theories and practices in a direct attempt to create impact       between audiences and individuals and expose ordinarily closed worlds such       as academia, public policy and art practice to the entire community to       foster exchanges and developments.
Presenting at Treadwell's is by       invitation and entry to each lecture costs the public between &#163;7-15.
There       were 50 places at each of MacCormack's talks, all of which sold out.
These       people came from many areas of public life.
They included artists, medical       and legal professionals, public workers, and students of various       disciplines.
MacCormack's talks increased their understanding of the       ethical relation between art and experience as it translates to mediation       between different subjects.
In her talks on cinema, occultism and the       esoteric, MacCormack drew attention to a neglected strand through the lens       of feminism, focusing on sexuality and the social demonization of       alterity, and thus addressing issues of social inclusion and cohesion.
In addition to the lecture series, MacCormack also spoke about her       research at a range of public festivals.
These included:             Abandon Normal Devices Festival of Cinema and Digital Culture.
Manchester, October 2010.
MacCormack was a paid interviewed speaker at         this event, which was attended by approx.
120 people.
The festival         utilised MacCormack as a guest to conduct interviews based around         challenges to gender in cinema.
This increased the level of public         debate about the perception of gender as performative and learned, and         publicly challenged opinions based on biological essentialism which have         been detrimental to social equality and inclusion;        Spill Festival.
Barbican.
London.
April 2011.
MacCormack was a         paid interview panel guest speaker at this event, which was attended by         approximately 40 people.
This festival panel focused on and discussed         one chapter of Cinesexuality (`Zombies without Organs'), for 40         members of the public, increasing their understanding of the         significance of feminine sexuality in the burgeoning popularity of         zombie culture in various media, including film, television, art, music         and popular culture.
