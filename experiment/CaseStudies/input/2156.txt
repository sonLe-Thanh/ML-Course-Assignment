     It is estimated that over 14,000 people are diagnosed worldwide with       malignant pleural       mesothelioma each year, around 2,500 of which are in the UK.
This disease       most commonly       develops between the ages of 50 and 70 years, affecting five times more       men than women.
Symptoms include shortness of breath, chest pains, fatigue, and weight       loss.
There is no cure and       the prognosis is poor; over 2,000 people die annually from the disease in       the UK.
Impact on Patients     If not for the Newcastle research and collaboration with Eli Lilly       Pharmaceuticals, pemetrexed       toxicity, which includes severe bone marrow suppression, vomiting,       fatigue, shortness of breath,       and anaemia, would have led to its clinical development being discontinued       [EV a].
Instead, it was       demonstrated for the first time that pemetrexed could be used safely in       patients and that the       toxicity and side effects could be reduced by supplementation with not       only folic acid, but also       vitamin B12.
A Vice President of Eli Lilly at the time the research was       carried out confirms that       during their collaborative work with the Newcastle group:     `...the identification of biomarkers related to folic acid and other         vitamins [including       homocysteine] has been fundamental to understand the toxicity of         Pemetrexed.
High levels of         homocysteine were associated to higher risk of developing severe         toxicity and in some         instances toxic deaths.
The supplementation of folic acid and vitamin         B12, currently part of the         label of Pemetrexed commercialized with the name of Alimta is the result         of this collaboration'       [EV a].
Continuing, he says that this ultimately permitted `...the completion         of the development of         Pemetrexed' [EV a].
The supplementation treatment means that       patients are better able to tolerate       the drug and stand to benefit from this treatment.
Following the Newcastle Phase I trial, the collaborative retrospective       study with Eli Lilly, and       incorporating vitamin B12 supplementation in a Phase II trial [R2, R3,       Section 2], a Phase III trial       [R4, Section 2] included the supplementation treatment and 500 mg/m2       body surface pemetrexed.
This is recognised in the 2008 National Institute for Health and Care       Excellence (NICE) guidelines       for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma, which states that `...with         effect from the date         of the protocol change, all patients received supplementation' [EV       b, p. 8].
The trial confirmed that       when pemetrexed was supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B12,       incidences of severe toxicity,       which include drug-related death, neutropenia (white blood cell       reduction), febrile neutropenia, and       diarrhoea, were significantly reduced, compared to when it was not [R4,       Section 2; EV b].
Supplemented pemetrexed treatment combined with cisplatin also resulted in       a significant increase       in patients' quality of life by reducing disease symptoms, including pain,       fatigue, anorexia, and       cough [R4, Section 2; EV b].
Using pemetrexed with cisplatin also resulted in a significant survival       benefit for patients with       malignant pleural mesothelioma.
In fully supplemented patients with       advanced disease, median       survival was 13.2 months when pemetrexed and cisplatin were administered,       versus 8.4 months       for patients given cisplatin alone [EV b].
Pemetrexed also increased       tumour response rates to       cisplatin (41.3% with pemetrexed versus 16.7%       without) and the median time to progressive disease       (defined as at least 20% growth in tumour size since       the start of treatment) was significantly longer for       patients who received pemetrexed and cisplatin as       compared with patients who received just cisplatin (5.7       months versus 3.9 months, respectively) [EV b].
Notably, there has been a marked increase in the       number of cancer (predominantly MPM) patients in the       UK receiving pemetrexed treatment following the       release of the 2008 NICE guidelines (bar chart) [EV c].
Impact on Clinical Practice     In accordance with the 2008 NICE guidelines [EV b, p. 8], pemetrexed with       cisplatin is currently the       only chemotherapy regimen licensed for treatment of malignant pleural       mesothelioma.
The       guidelines cite the Phase III trial [R4, Section 2] which adopted vitamin       B12 with folic acid       supplementation into its protocol as a result of the collaborative work       between Newcastle and Eli       Lilly [R2, Section 3] as the only identified randomised controlled       pemetrexed trial in malignant       pleural mesothelioma.
The NICE guidelines clearly state that `...in         order to reduce toxicity, patients         treated with pemetrexed must receive folic acid and vitamin B12         supplementation' [EV b, p. 6].
This       is also clearly stated in the 2004 FDA and EMEA approvals for pemetrexed       (Alimta) and in its       prescription information, and the maximum tolerated dose of 500 mg/m2       body surface area [EV d].
Notably, the US National Guideline Clearinghouse website provides a link       to the NICE guidelines       [EV e].
A Phase II trial on the treatment of patients with malignant       pleural mesothelioma with       pemetrexed and carboplatin, recently reported that 70% of the 76 patients       enrolled exhibited       clinical improvement after just two courses and that the pemetrexed dose       of 500 mg/m2 body       surface area was well tolerated [EV f].
The former Vice President of Eli Lilly states that to date:     `...Alimta has been used globally by hundreds of thousands of patients         and it is standard of         care in [mesothelioma and non small cell lung cancer].
The         collaboration [between Newcastle       University and Eli Lilly] has been crucial for the advancement of the         knowledge in this field and         the achievement of the introduction of a medicine that changed the         modality of treatment for         mesothelioma and lung cancer' [EV a].
Pemetrexed treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation was       also adopted into the       NICE guidelines for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (comprises       most lung cancers) in       December 2010 [EV g] and for maintenance treatment of this disease in 2012       [EV h].
Clinical Trials     There are currently 361 clinical trials (either open or completed in       2008-2013) registered on       clinicaltrials.gov that use pemetrexed in accordance with the FDA and Eli       Lilly guidelines.
These       include trials on malignant pleural mesothelioma, non-small cell lung       cancer, squamous cell head       and neck cancer, advanced urothelial carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, and       thyroid cancer, and       involve over 58,000 patients [EV i].
