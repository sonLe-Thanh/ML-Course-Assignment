     This case study provides theoretical and policy fusions between SP and EA       translating complex science into accessible and operational       decision-support tools (RUFopoly and EATME) that enable different       public(s) audiences to engage with complex planning issues.
Due to the       co-production research model used, policy and practice team members use       these tools to shape their ongoing national, regional and local planning       processes and outputs, and individual behaviours.
RUFopoly is an interactive learning game set within a fictitious RUF that       requires players to engage with issues that were experienced within our       RUF project.
Using a 28 square board format divided into questions       addressing `SP and EA', `values', `connections' and `time', players make a       collective journey, answering questions determined by the throw of a die.
Answers are discussed, recorded and justified leading to visions based on       previous justifications promoting reflexivity and social learning.
"RUFopoly         provided an innovative way of discussing key issues", said       Birmingham City Council's Head of Planning.
The game has now been played and used as part of strategy formation by       Government (Welsh Government: Natural Resource Management Programme),       Business (Greater Birmingham and Solihull LEP: (http://centreofenterprise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/GBSLEP-SSFP-         Worcestershire1.pdf), to help Councillors in plan development       (Politicians in Planning Network; Staffordshire County Council) and       support GCSE and A Level curricula within six school workshops (Queen Mary       Grammar School Walsall), championed by the Geographical Association       (http://www.geography.org.uk/download/GA_1119RUFopoly.doc)       and ESRC       (http://www.socialscienceforschools.org.uk/news/blog-2013/July-2013.aspx).
One teacher Kirsty Mitchell commented "it has some good links with the         course and is useful in terms of decision making for their year 13         exams".
It has been recognized as an exemplar for adaptive management and social       learning within RCUK's Living With Environmental Change partnership (http://www.lwec.org.uk/supporting-         journey-adaptation), ESRC (http://www.esrc.ac.uk/news-and-events/features-         casestudies/features/26803/land-management-at-the-roll-of-a-dice.aspx)       and has enabled people to engage explicitly with environmental change       agendas; nationally, through the Sustainable Development Commission's       `Games to Save the Planet' project       (http://ecoactiongames.org.uk/live/wp-content/uploads/fun-games-post-event-report.pdf)       and internationally through RCUK funded Humanitarian Futures Programme       (http://www.elrha.org/dialogues/case-studies/case-study-25-board-games).
Its flexible format makes it well suited to international application.
The Rural Futures Institute Nebraska worked with Scott to develop       `Plainsopoly'; also, funding has been secured for a Swedish version.
Its       unique impact has been recognized in the Observer       (http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/dec/11/lucy-siegle-childrens-board-games).
The EATME tree builds on the RUF project via the creation of an       accessible web platform that mainstreams the value of nature in policy and       decision-making processes, allowing users to apply various policy tools       within particular contexts (plans, policies or programmes) and guidance       from the ecosystem approach.
The Natural Resource Use Advisor of Natural       Resources Wales (NRW) states that, "Alister has succeeded in putting         the ecosystem approach into practice".
EATME is being developed and       tested simultaneously with the project co-investigators involving       academic, policy and practice participants.
For example, Welsh Government       and NRW are using EATME within their policy frameworks.
As the Natural       Resource Use Advisor to Natural Resources Wales states, "So whilst our         framework is operational guidance, it currently lacks tools and it is         here that the EATME tree provides an accessible web portal for our         staff".
A significant aspect of the research impact from both outputs derives       from the way the research process was orchestrated to incorporate       stakeholders as full team members, engaged actively in co-producing       knowledge.
The former Chair of the Rural Working Party for OECD, a member       of our EATME team, states "... it can secure much greater impact by         drawing on the different experiences and professional background of a         diverse team"... "This is the way to spread knowledge of research &#8212;         communicating through the team members."
This also leads directly to       active changes in the way team members work and has influenced processes       in host organizations.
Natural England's Head of Profession: Ecosystem       Approach, states, "I was impressed by Alister's leadership and         innovation... RUFopoly as a learning tool helps people engage with         complex issues ... "a tool we have used in our own staff development         sessions."
Furthermore the Rural Affairs Director at the National       Farmers Union, following a visit to Malmo to play RUFopoly, has set up a       new collaboration with Swedish dairy farmers looking at how to maximize       RUF benefits.
This case study challenges traditional approaches to policy and       decision-making and research outputs.
Research team members have worked       with Scott on both academic and policy outputs including the Progress         in Planning Paper.
Scott is also extending the research into       professional and practice domains; e.g.
June/July RICS Property           Journal 2013; and as a member of the RTPI Planning         Practice and Research Committee.
Additionally, the RUF project has       been shortlisted for the RTPI award for excellence in spatial planning       research 2013.
RTPI's Head of Policy states, the "project(s) reported         here provide a new impetus for spatial planning...
It is vital for the         future of the profession that grounded, innovative research that meets         the needs of planning policy and practice continues".
