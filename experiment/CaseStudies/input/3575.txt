     Parker Hannifin     The metamodel-based optimisation methods developed in the UoA and       described in Section 2 have been combined with high fidelity Computational       Fluid Dynamics analysis (Thompson, School of Mechanical Engineering,       University of Leeds) to develop new product design optimisation software       [A, B, C].
A transformation of the design variable space was proposed that       has dramatically improved the fidelity of the metamodel without an       excessive number of CFD simulations thus providing a practical tool for       the pump designers [A].
Based on research in the UoA the company developed software which they       then used to increase the efficiency of their jet pumps by 20% [A].
From       2010 this optimisation software was applied to the new Racor Super       Impactor crankcase ventilator to reduce engine emissions in line with Euro       6 requirements and boost fuel efficiency [A].
This new component of diesel       filtration systems was awarded the prestigious Grand Prix prize at the       2012 British Engineering Excellence Awards: "An inventive engineering       solution that solves a significant environmental problem and which has       strong commercial drivers to a large potential market" [D].
This innovation based on research described in Section 2 has enabled the       company to secure a number of orders from major clients, thereby creating       80 new jobs [A].
The company has further used this new product to gain new       business from a key manufacturer in the agriculture and construction       machines sector.
This contract, worth &#163;1.5 million per year (2012-2017),       has led the company to appoint nine new employees to deliver the new       business [A].
The company has further stated that "the research is having       a major influence on the company's current strategy and growth plans; the       company expects that its engagement with Leeds will directly lead to a       further &#163;3 million revenue per year by 2013/14, growing to &#163;10 million per       year by 2015" [A].
Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust     The Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS) provides emergency services to       people across Yorkshire and their fleet of vehicles travel 40 million       kilometres each year.
YAS has over 110 locations, 4500 staff and 1500       vehicles.
Having participated in the Carbon Trust's Public Sector Carbon       Management programme in 2010, YAS drew up a Carbon Management Plan for       2011-2015.
Taking 2007 as the baseline year when the carbon footprint was       16,531 tonnes of CO2, YAS decided to set a target of a 30%       reduction in carbon usage by 2015 with the added benefit of a cost saving       of &#163;3.39 million.
Researchers in the UoA secured an EPSRC Knowledge Transfer Secondment       (EP/H500251/1) which allowed them to work with YAS in applying the       optimisation research described above to ambulance design in conjunction       with Computational Fluid Dynamics from the School of Mechanical       Engineering at Leeds (Thompson).
Initial investigation led to a focus on       the light bars on the vehicle roof and this demonstrated that the drag       force could be reduced by up to 20% [E].
This optimised design was applicable to up to 60% of the YAS fleet which       was shown to equate to an annual &#163;700,000 saving in fuel costs and an       annual reduction of 500 tCO2 [E].
Based on the results of the KTS YAS commissioned new ambulance designs       that came into operation in early July 2013 [E].
The new vehicles have       achieved 26 mpg compared to 16-18 mpg previously [E].
Given the figure of       40 million kilometres per year across the YAS fleet this equates to       significant potential savings.
YAS state "in the first year of utilising       the new vehicles in part of the fleet YAS expect to save &#163;300,000 in fuel"       along with the consequent CO2 reductions [E].
Rolls-Royce     The research on optimisation outlined above has been implemented in the       Rolls-Royce SOFT optimisation system leading to its successful use during       the REF period "in live aeroengine design projects with tens of hours of       CPU time per simulation and over a hundred design variables" [F].
In this       way the research in the UoA has led to optimisation of designs that was       previously impossible due to prohibitive computational requirements [F].
Rolls-Royce states that the systems based on the UoA research "has been       successfully used for real-life optimisation of RR compressor blades (e.g.
the ESS (Engine Sector Stator blade) component of a high-bypass ratio       engine) and on the Trent turbine HP and IP stages that are being developed       in RR".
Through using the MAM outlined in Section 2 Rolls-Royce have seen       a reduction in CPU time of an order of magnitude and significantly       improved performance in handling near equality constraints [F].
Ultimately       this has led to "0.15% efficiency improvements of critical components like       IP (Intermediate Pressure) Turbine stages of a modern high by-pass jet       engine" in the REF period [F].
Rolls-Royce has used the SOFT optimisation system on a number of other       design projects for turbomachinery.
Whilst the Rolls-Royce system has a       range of optimisation techniques, Rolls-Royce states that "so far, MAM has       proved to be the most efficient and accurate of the optimisers where       expensive high fidelity CFD codes are used in the optimisation process"       [F] and that "overall MAM has been an order of magnitude faster than other       previously used techniques, this has reduced the optimisation time       significantly, and made MAM a practical design tool on a modest Linux       cluster" [F].
It is hard to put a financial figure to these benefits and Rolls-Royce do       not calculate such figures due to the uncertainties of operating       conditions and other variables.
However, given that a commercial airline       spends billions of dollars per year on fuel [G], even a small efficiency       improvement leads to millions of dollars of cost savings.
