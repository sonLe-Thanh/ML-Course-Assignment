     The impact of the research during 2008-13 is multi-dimensional including       international outreach to current new ISO standards being drafted and 32       countries developing future robust acoustic solutions.
It has been       instrumental in developing new regulations, policies and standards for       sound insulation leading to innovative knowledge transfer to industry via       the robust details handbook.
The compliance rates for sound insulation in       the UK are now 99% and noise complaints in new dwellings have fallen four       fold in 2010 when compared with previous noise complaint statistics in       2004 (NHBC statistics provided in 2011).
The quality of life for home       occupants has been improved with the average sound insulation performance       being 7 decibels above regulatory requirements providing nearly 8 times       the sound energy reduction.
A key attribute of the research project was the development of the Robust       Detail design Handbook providing clarity of technical information,       guidance and specifications.
Over 4,700 handbooks have been sold during       the REF impact period.
62% of all new homes use the robust details scheme       [5.1] and this is a testament to the transfer of the research findings       into a Handbook specification format which is easily incorporated into       architectural details.
There have been 1,900 site inspections and 6,000       on-site sample acoustic test undertaken (2008-13) which are entered into       the UK's (and world leading) most in-depth sound insulation database.
Over       600,000 people in the UK now live in 300,000 robust detail homes built       during 2008-2013 [5.2].
30 new innovative robust details using UK       manufactured products have been developed during 2008-13, delivering over       300 wall and floor combinations for architects and developers to specify       in apartments.
Smith et al research to develop patents for technical compatible       solutions for acoustics and structure led to innovative new products such       as Icopal-Bridgestop.
This was approved as a robust detail (RD       ref:E-WM-19) in December 2009 as the highest sound insulation separating       wall in the UK.
It provides the maximum 4 credits for the Code for       Sustainable Homes "Health and Wellbeing" [5.3] delivering enhanced quality       of life for occupants versus minimum building standards.
Scottish building       standards also incorporated the Robust Details approach in 2011.
The       resultant outputs of 5 published patents from Smith's team have all been       declared robust detail compliant since 2008 and form a suite of 16       products manufactured in the UK, with a combined turnover of over &#163;3       million.
The "Acoustic Wall Strap" for timber frame party walls [5.4] was       designed to deliver high sound insulation performance is licensed in North       America (2009) which has a 90% timber frame market and was also granted a       full European patent (3rd July 2013).
The product uses 30% less       steel but has twice the compressive strength which will enhance structural       stability for future climate change issues such as high wind loadings on       buildings.
In 2009 Smith's team were awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize       for "Innovative housing construction for environmental benefit and quality       of life" awarded for the outstanding impact to industry, environment and       society [5.5, 5.6] from the original Robust Standards Details research       project.
In 2010 the RD approach annually saved the industry &#163;14 million and       reduces 17,000 car journeys from the UK's roads by not having to undertake       large scale testing [5.7].
During 2008-13 Smith has given over 20       seminars on sound insulation and product innovation to the UK construction       industry and government departments totalling over 900 attendees.
In       addition he has given invited international presentations to Italian       authorities in Rome (October 2009) and Milan (Feb 2011) [5.8], Swedish       industry and government organisations (Stockholm October 2010) and Hong       Kong/China officials in (January 2013).
Smith was nominated by European countries to lead the EU COST       Action TU0901 WG3 (2009-13) to develop new robust solutions involving 29       EU countries and Canada, New Zealand and Australia [5.9].
The significant       on-site sound insulation database developed for Robust Details supported       by Smith's team allowed the first comparative analysis of the proposed       changes to ISO 717 (NP 16717).
This invited paper demonstrated how the       proposed ISO changes to performance descriptors from Germany would not       deal with addressing low frequency sound insulation issues in real       attached homes.
This led to the UK and Scottish government departments       writing to the Chair of the ISO committee and the UK ISO representatives       being able to advise the ISO committee on sound insulation performance       prescriptors and their influences leading to a refreshed approach to a       future ISO 717.
Finally, in 2012 the Government undertook a review of the Effect of Noise       Policy Interventions (funded by Defra) which demonstrated the positive       impact for compliance rates due to the RD scheme.
