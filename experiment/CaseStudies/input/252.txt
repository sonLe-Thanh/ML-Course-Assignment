     The impact occurred in 2010, and was the result of novel statistical       methods developed and published over the period 2004-2008.
The impact was       made possible through:     (i) Firth's direct involvement as a consultant to the       broadcasters BBC and ITV in connection with the previous General Election       held in May 2005.
(ii) The fact that the methods developed for the 2005 election had       received high-profile attention from pollsters and broadcasters,       through their publication in 2007 (and ultimately in print in 2008) as one       of the Royal Statistical Society's prestigious Ordinary Meeting       papers.
(iii) The fact that Firth had also written fully-documented software       to implement the methods &#8212; software that could readily be used by       knowledgeable others at a later election (as indeed was the case at the       May 2010 election).
The research done by Firth (with Curtice) for the 2005 General Election       produced methods which have since become the industry standard.
At the       most recent General Election in May 2010 those methods were used not only       by BBC and ITV, but also for the first time by the prominent satellite and       online broadcaster, Sky.
The reasons are clear:     (i) The combination of methods described in Curtice and Firth (2008) is       substantially more sophisticated statistically than any of the relatively       simple approaches that had been used prior to 2005.
(ii) On the day of the 2005 election the analysis performed by Curtice       and Firth for the BBC and ITV networks had resulted in an unprecedented, perfect       prediction of the resulting 66-seat Labour majority in the House of       Commons.
This accuracy was impressive in its own right.
It put paid to the       myth that exit-poll-based predictions are always unreliable (a myth due       largely to a spectacular failure by both BBC and ITV forecasters at the       1992 election &#8212; see Payne(2003)[9]).
Moreover, the prediction of a 66-seats majority on 5 May 2005 was substantially       different from the 100-120 seats majority predictions that had been made       in many of the national newspapers on the strength of the latest       pre-election voting intention polls.
The exit-poll analysis had provided       BBC and ITV with exactly what they wanted, a story-changing prediction       that strongly influenced their TV coverage from 10pm on election night.
By the time of the May 2010 election, Firth himself had moved on to other       projects; he was not available at that time as a consultant to the       broadcasters.
He did, however, provide software (written in R, with a       user-friendly interface) for use by the BBC's and ITV's new generation of       statistical consultants (Dr Stephen Fisher of the University of Oxford,       and Dr Jouni Kuha of the London School of Economics and Political       Science).
Fisher and Kuha, again with the political expertise of Professor       John Curtice on hand, applied the methods of Curtice and Firth (2008) to       the data from an exit poll conducted by market-research companies MORI and       NOP for BBC, ITV and Sky.
The result was, again, a perfect       prediction of the all-important number of House of Commons seats for the       largest party; in 2010, again, it allowed the broadcasters to talk about       the "right" story from 10pm on election night, this time a hung parliament       with the Conservatives as largest party (on 307 seats, 19 seats short of       an overall majority).
The direct significance and reach of the impact, in connection       with the 2010 General election, are clear and substantial:     (i) The methods of Firth and Curtice (2008) were adopted         enthusiastically at the 2010 election by the major broadcasters (and       by their new generation of statistical consultants).
(ii) The methods had proven to be so effective at the 2005 election that       the consortium of broadcasters using them was enlarged to include also         Sky for the first time in 2010 (in addition to BBC and ITV).
(iii) The broadcasts made from 10pm on election night 6 May 2010 were       watched, heard and browsed (on TV, radio and the internet) by many         millions of people in the UK and abroad [e.g., source [8] says "A         peak audience of 6.6 million watched David Dimbleby anchor Election 2010         on BBC One, BBC HD, BBC News Channel and on BBC Two in the nations, with         a 4.7 million average, 36.1 per cent share and 16.1 million reach."].
The exit-poll-based prediction of the final election outcome was central       to those broadcasts (see, e.g., source [5]) for at least the first couple       of hours &#8212; this being the peak viewing/listening/browsing period.
(iv) The fact that the methods delivered highly accurate       predictions to millions of people was a major contribution to the         immediate public understanding of a political outcome that was       likely to be complex and to require negotiation in advance of the       formation of a new Government.
(v) The exit-poll-based prediction was surprising to many,       including some prominent political commentators.
In particular, the       prediction based on the exit poll was that the Liberal Democrats would       lose some seats in the House of Commons, whereas the pre-election voting       intention polls had quite consistently suggested an increased       number of seats for the Liberal Democrats.
In the event, the 57 seats       actually won by the Liberal Democrats in 2010 (down from 62 seats in 2005)       was very close to, and even slightly worse for that party than, the       59-seats prediction that was broadcast from the exit poll.
Sources [2], [6] and [7] confirm the role played by the methods of       Curtice and Firth [1] at the 2010 election, including the inclusion for       the first time of Sky among the broadcasters using the methods.
The letter       [6] to Firth from the BBC's Editor of Political Research includes this:       "The importance of [the accuracy of the prediction] to the BBC,         and to the other broadcasters too, is hard to overstate.
After the         disaster of the 1992 election, predictions based on UK exit polls were         for many years viewed with great scepticism.
The methods you developed         for the 2005 election have completely turned this around.
Our         election-night programming, on TV, radio and the internet, is some of         the most high-profile and important work that the BBC ever does.
To have         authority restored to the election night broadcast is invaluable to us         (and, we like to think, also to the viewing/listening/browsing public,         in the UK and more widely); not least because in recent elections the         exit poll has become even more crucial to our flagship election night         programme.
In 1992 &#8212; the last general election without local elections         held on the same day &#8212; the exit poll prediction announced at 10pm had         been displaced by 1am with a prediction based on 156 declared results.
In the 2010 election only 11 seats had been declared by 1am.
In 1992, by         2am some 464 seats had declared: in 2010, the equivalent figure was 62.
As a result, the exit poll prediction carries our programme for much         longer than in past elections and its accuracy is therefore more closely         scrutinized than ever before.
Without such effective exit-poll         methodology, the broadcasts on 6-7 May 2010 would have been         substantially less informative and less engaging to the audience(s).
Your methods are now certainly the `industry standard' for UK electoral         exit polling and associated prediction, and it is almost inconceivable         that they would not be used again at the next election due in 2015."
The letter [7] to Firth from the BBC's statistical consultants at the 2010       election includes:       "The statistical methods that you developed for the 2005 election, and         which you reported and analysed in Curtice and Firth (2008), were         absolutely crucial to the success of our work at the 2010 election.
Your         kind help in providing R software made it relatively easy for us to         adopt the same methods in 2010, and we did so &#8212; with great success, as         you know!
The approach that you developed in Curtice and Firth (2008) is         now the `gold standard' in this area of work, and will surely be used         again at future elections."
Sources [4] and [5] exemplify the surprise, even disbelief, among       political commentators.
At 10pm on election night, the BBC TV presenter       David Dimbleby himself [5] said of the prediction, on air:       "If that's right the Liberal Democrats despite all that noise and fury         have actually dropped 3 seats, which could be one reason why we need to         be sceptical about this exit poll."
After the event, John Rentoul in the Independent on Sunday (9 May       2010) wrote:       "The accurate prediction was so shocking, at 10pm on Thursday, that         large numbers of Conservatives flooded the internet to scorn it as         utterly implausible and to say that it could not possibly be right         because it failed to accord with what they felt in their bones.
Most         incautious was Iain Dale, Tory blogger and would-be candidate, who said:         'It seems too incredible to be true that the Lib Dems are only predicted         to get 59 seats.
I'll run naked down Whitehall if that turns out to be         true.'
In the end, of course, the Lib Dems won even fewer seats, 57.
Dale's streak is eagerly awaited."
Source [3] is a web-based public engagement resource that was made       available by Firth soon after the 2010 election.
It is designed to make       this story accessible to non-specialists (e.g., to non- statistical       journalists as well as to members of the general public).
The main page       there gives a non-technical description of the methods used, as well as       some history, press quotes, references, etc.
It is hoped that this very       public success story has a substantial, indirect impact additional to the       various direct impacts detailed above &#8212; namely, that it helps to inspire       school-age students to consider mathematical sciences as a field of study       and as a potentially interesting career choice.
