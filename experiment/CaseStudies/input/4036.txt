     The key impacts of our research as cited in S2 and S3 are:            Influencing the development of the economic policy for Manchester City         Region and         the recently-created Manchester Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP), and         the         development of inward investment policy for Greater Birmingham and         Solihull LEP.
Changing awareness and understanding within the Department for         Business,         Innovation and Skills and UK Trade and Investment of the effects of         inward         investment, and allowing them to judge ex ante whether certain         types of inward         investment are likely to bring benefits to the UK economy.
Changing the strategic thinking underlying the EU's framework for         evaluating the         impact of outward FDI on EU countries.
Manchester City Region and Greater Birmingham and Solihull LEP       The Financial Times (Ref 5.4) described the Manchester       Independent Economic Review       project (Ref 5, S3) as "the most comprehensive study of its type done in       Europe".
The report       explored the relative impacts of inward and domestic investment in the       city region, and drew       heavily on the Aston analysis contained in Refs 1-4 above.
It was       presented to large groups       of stakeholders on a number of occasions, including in March 2009 to 500       economic       development professionals, representatives from the nine councils making       up the Manchester       City Region, Regional Development Agencies and journalists (details of the       events are in Ref         5.1).
The report developed "a shared evidence base which can be used to       underpin policy choices       regarding future priorities for strategic investment and to bridge some of       the persistent gulfs in       understanding that exist in the Manchester City Region (and in other City       Regions), about how       regional economies grow" (Ref 5.1).
The key lesson was that regions       should rely more on       building indigenous capacity as well as on inward investment: this has had       considerable       impact on the development of economic policy in Manchester.
For example,       the document       making the case for the establishment of the Greater Manchester Local       Enterprise Partnership       (GM LEP) drew specifically on the Aston element of MIER in calling for a       policy of "enhancing       the international connectivity of our businesses through increased inward       investment and       international trade."
(Ref 5.2).
The MIER analysis was subsequently       developed by the GM       LEP into the Greater Manchester Strategy (Ref 5.3), two of       the strategic objectives of which       derived directly from the Aston research:            Target firms in the city region with the highest potential to           expand internationally.
Increase the level of foreign direct investment (FDI) into the city           region.
As a result of the MIER project, members of the Aston team were invited       in 2011 to offer       advice on inward investment policy and regional development to Birmingham.
This was       instrumental in Driffield being invited to join the economic strategy       group of the Greater       Birmingham and Solihull LEP.
In 2012, Driffield, Love and Du subsequently       obtained an       ESRC follow-on award (Maximising the benefits of inward investment)       to develop an inward       investment strategy for Birmingham City Council and the Greater Birmingham       and Solihull       LEP.
This has fed into the Greater Birmingham Project (see Refs 5.5         and 5.6)     BIS/UKTI       The ESRC project "Who really gains from inward investment" has resulted in       impact with       considerable policy-oriented reach and significance at both regional and       national level.
A key       finding of this research is that employment creation and technology       transfer through inward       investment are typically mutually exclusive, although policy usually hopes       for both to occur       simultaneously.
Crucially, therefore, this work has changed awareness and       understanding at       BIS and UKTI of the effects of inward investment in the UK, and policy       makers at BIS and       UKTI have observed that this finding has changed how they think about       inward investment       policy.
For example, BIS/UKTI produce a regular "case for intervention"       which is their analysis       of the important academic contributions to UK policy on inward FDI.
The       2011 publication       (Ref 5.7) cites and discusses 12 publications from the Aston team,       including Refs 3.2, 3.3,         3.4 and 3.6.
The European Commission       The thrust of the 2012 European Competitiveness Report (Ref 5.8) is       on globalisation and       FDI.
Chapter 4 presents a framework for evaluating the impact of outward       FDI on EU       countries: the Aston research has significantly influenced the       Commission's thinking on this       topic.
Table 4.7 in this report is adapted from the conceptual framework       in Refs 3.3 and 3.4       and is acknowledged as such.
The discussion of the possible detrimental       effects of FDI is       taken from the ESRC final report (Ref 3.1).
Finally, the       discussion of employment effects of       FDI discussed in the Competitiveness Report is taken from Ref 3.4       and is cited as such.
