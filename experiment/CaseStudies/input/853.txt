     Research by the University of Leeds has informed and shaped understanding       and the decision-making process of those responsible for reforming the       school science curriculum, demonstrating a distinctive contribution to       secondary science education policy and practice.
Enhancing participation       in post-compulsory science has become a major policy goal within the UK,       but there has been a clear need for research to inform science curriculum       changes so that an appropriate foundation for further science study is       provided whilst the school science experience of those students who do not       want to pursue post-compulsory science courses is still enhanced.
As an expert in his field, Professor Donnelly was appointed to the       committee developing the Royal Society's four `State of the Nation       Reports' (2007 &#8212; 2011), which identified and assessed patterns and trends       in participation and attainment in science and mathematics.
Aimed at       influencing future educational policy, Professor Donnelly chaired the       subgroup for one of the reports, `Science and mathematics education for       14-19 year olds', contributing findings from University of Leeds research       into applied science [RG1].
Published in 2008, this report is now       referred to extensively in policy debates concerning the school science       curriculum.
For example, it is widely cited in a review commissioned by       the Government in 2010 on science and mathematics secondary education [A].
The evaluation of the GCSE Twenty First Century Science [RG3] was       also central to the call that insights from the development of this       qualification should guide the revision of the new GCSEs which were       introduced in 2006 (as reported in [4]), with ongoing impact       through to 2008 and beyond.
The Director of the Nuffield Foundation       reports that the "evaluation of the Twenty First Century Science pilots         was an important and influential piece of work", adding that, "Jim         [Donnelly] was one of the few people in the country with the authority,         expertise and independence to have carried out this piece of work".
[B]     The research into applied science [RG1, RG2] also proved       significant in ensuring that the previous government's decision to go       ahead with a Science Diploma in schools (subsequently abandoned by the       Coalition Government) sought to address key issues of status and       scientific content within the aims of the Diploma.
The Director of the       Nuffield Foundation stated that [RG2] "provided a clear and         authoritative picture of what was happening ... this affected our own         thinking directly but it also had influence at wider policy levels".
[B]     In particular, this study [RG2] was presented by the Director of       the Nuffield Foundation directly to the Qualifications and Curriculum       Development Agency (QCDA) STEM curriculum committee in 2009, and was "received         with great interest and changed thinking within QCDA.
I can say from         experience that few of the discussions of that committee were informed         by such clear and reliable data"... "the data about uptake of         Applied Science at GCSE and Level 3 were new to the people on the         committee.
They hadn't appreciated the scale of the uptake of AS, the         rate of growth."
[B]     The route to impact can also be traced through University of Leeds       research directly informing and shaping educational policy through, for       example, inclusion of research recommendations in the National Curriculum       Review (NCR).
The outcomes from the EISER research study [1, 3, 4]         [RG5] formed the basis of a submission of written evidence in May       2011 to the Department for Education NCR.
Although lines of impact within       educational policy are inherently difficult to evidence directly, the       science curriculum reform proposals, published in February 2013, do       include the EISER recommendation that the `science curriculum should       include canonical science knowledge, insights into the practices of       science, and discussions about science-related issues that impact on       society (e.g.
climate change)'.
Moreover, as a direct result of this research and subsequent submission,       Professor Ryder was invited on 31 May 2011 to join the NCR Science Expert       Working Group.
The director of the Science NCR team at the DfE states that       "we have engaged with the [EISER] study and taken into account its         findings."[C].
In a series of private meetings within the DfE       (June 2011 &#8212; July 2012), Professor Ryder also presented the findings of       University of Leeds research to members of the NCR team leading on the       content and development of the new national curriculum.
Further impact is demonstrated by how research has informed and shaped       research and development activities of professional organisations aiming       to influence Government practice and policy.
The Head of Education Pre-19       at the Institute of Physics, the leading scientific society working to       advance physics education, research and application, references how EISER       NPD analysis has resulted in ongoing work:     "The EISER research, along with other data from the NPD, contributed         to the Institute's decision to set up and fund a project to look at the         effects of socio-economic conditions on children's likelihood to choose         physics at A-level."
[D]     The Director of Programmes [E] in the Education Team at the       Gatsby Charitable Foundation, which aims to strengthen science,       engineering and maths education in the UK and inform national policy,       states that the "Science Education team at Leeds University have made a         significant and sustained impact on our understanding of the science         curriculum in schools.
Through a series of investigations and         evaluations they have been able to highlight the differences between the         science curriculum as intended by policy makers and as experienced by         teachers and students."
Furthermore, "From a Gatsby perspective their early work on the role         of practical work in the science curriculum has been critical in         informing our current work in trying to understand how a more benign         system of assessment could promote the development of laboratory skills."
(reference to [RG6, RG7]).
In relation to more recent work led by Professor Ryder, the Director also       reports that EISER analysis of the National Pupil Database "has         provided a strong evidence base for the continued push towards triple         science at KS4 although with some important caveats around inclusion         issues".
As a result a `push towards triple science' has become a       key policy goal of the Gatsby Charitable Foundation.
