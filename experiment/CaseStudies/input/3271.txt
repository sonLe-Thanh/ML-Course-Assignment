     This research had a direct impact on the development of resources to         enhance professional practice and an influence on professional         standards guidelines or training for NATO forces.
It has enjoyed       frequent citation in a public discussion, consultation document or         judgement and also citation by journalists, broadcasters or         social media.
Below and in Section 5 we provide documented         evidence of influence on guidelines, legislation, regulation, policy or         standards in NATO forces and the British military working in       cooperation with the human rights office of the United Nations Assistance       Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and the International Committee of the Red       Cross (ICRC).
The contribution of the research to the development of resources to       enhance professional practice of NATO forces, the British military, UNAMA       human rights and the ICRC is the application of the DWI-based CBDAR in       support of their efforts to reduce civilian casualties in Afghanistan.
In       2010, the CBDAR field work operated through the Commander International       Stabilisation Afghanistan Force's (COMISAF) Tactical Directive to minimise       civilian casualties in Afghanistan.
Procedural changes range from the       nature of air strikes to check-point protocols.
Precise details of       improvements to rules of engagement cannot be made public but their       positive effects persist to this day.
The evidence comes primarily from an       authorized public statement and podcast, both made by Lieutenant Colonel       Cameron (Royal Army Medical Corps (GBR-A (OF-5) Stabilisation Division       Health Advisor, HQ Regional Command South, Kandahar) in 2010:     "Since October 2009 CBDAR methodology has and continues to be used by         NATO forces in Southern Afghanistan to reduce injuries to Afghan         civilians.
The methodology has already led to changes in NATO procedure         after a number of military activities that have caused civilian         mortality have been identified.
This has reduced the number of civilian         incidents and thus protected the population from some of the effects of         conflict."
Lt Colonel Cameron also confirms that the application of CBDARs has       provided a basis for closer co-operation between NATO forces and       international humanitarian organisations:     "It was agreed that we invite the UNAMA Human Rights Unit to be the         first of our external companions.
UNAMA HR agreed to a couple of initial         meetings where we provided our CBDAR methodology and operating         procedures.
From these initial meetings we now have regular civilian         casualty meetings that are also observed on by the International         Committee of the Red Cross."
The research has contributed significantly to public discussions by       broadcasters.
The original work developing the DWI (publication 1) was       covered inter alia by Nature in 2008.
The work on the Iraq Dirty       War indices (publications 3, 4 and 5 in Section 3 above) was covered inter       alia by Reuters, the New York Times, Washington Post, Guardian,         Christian Science Monitor, Daily Telegraph, Time, Reuters, CNN, National         Public Radio, Miller-McCune and PHYSORG.com.
A few examples are       provided in Section 5.
This Iraq-based DWI research has also been cited in       a 2011 campaign aimed at curtailing the use of explosive weapons in       populated areas (source 3i and 3ii).
