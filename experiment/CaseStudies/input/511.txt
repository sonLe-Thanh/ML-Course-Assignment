     Opening out Shakespeare to the wider community       Lee's previous research had shown that Shakespeare was taught in Hong Kong       as a repository of colonial tradition and appealed primarily to a small       minority of elite students.
This project, although new in January 2013,       has generated a strong desire by local individuals and institutions to       change the status quo and to open out Shakespeare as a site for       cross-cultural dialogue relevant to the wider community.
In particular,       the HK Education Bureau has agreed to `promote the use of materials       generated by Lee in schools to meet the broad learning outcomes of our       curriculum'.
Using Shakespeare as a site to debate contemporary issues       The research specific to this project has been used to raise consciousness       of race, gender, sexuality, class and colonial issues.
To give an example       of how Shakespeare is being used to explore racism, students are asked to       examine Act 3, Scene 2 of Othello.
They are told: "Imagine this       play is set in twenty-first century Hong Kong.
Instead of being a `Moor',       the hero is perhaps Filipino or Pakistani.
How would a native-born Hong       Kong Iago, and `gentlemen', behave around him?
What would their body       language and facial expressions be like?
...In other words, consider how       outsiders can be treated even when they have positions of authority like       Othello's."
New materials and activities       Pedagogical materials have been developed out of this research with the       support of the HK Education Bureau and the British Council that schools,       BC projects and theatre directors will use in the academic year 2013-14.
They can be adjusted to meet the needs of 12-16 year olds, 16-18s and       adults in Higher Education.
Lee paid particular attention to low-cost,       flexible activities which appeal to both non-elite and elite pupils and       teachers both in schools and in theatres, to ensure multi-level engagement       that will sustainably resonate beyond the classroom.
Shakespeare in         Hong Kong has therefore already influenced Honk Kong's policy on       curriculum design and content and will deliver further impact when the       materials are used in the academic year 2013-14.
Five themed learning sheets have been developed, primarily to help       teachers answer to the recognised need in the Hong Kong classroom for:            a more active approach to Shakespeare       an approach anchored in local culture       an increased openness to `oppositional reading'          Specifically, in accord with the HK Education Bureau aims, the activities       will create an inspiring learning environment and develop an education       system that is rich in tradition, cosmopolitan and culturally diverse.
The impact works through three collaborative partners:             The Chief Curriculum Development Office for English at the Hong           Kong Education Bureau         The team at the office has shared its knowledge and expertise and agrees         on the need for change.
It will oversee the dissemination of Lee's new         materials in 2013/14.
It attests to the benefits of the project in         influencing the curriculum and informing cultural content.
The British Council (BC)         Since 2010 the BC has been running "Shakespeare: A Worldwide Classroom,"         a project which originated in a partnership with the Royal Shakespeare         Company and local theatrical company Theatre Noir.
While in Hong Kong,         Lee contributed to this project as part of the British Council's request         that she investigate how their project could be extended.
Based on the         insights provided by the project, Lee produced teaching materials which         the BC has agreed to adopt.
Theatre directors         Theatre directors in Hong Kong have tended to avoid producing         Shakespeare.
Already keen to address the issues highlighted by Lee's         research, theatre directors involved in the BC's Shakespeare project are         using Lee's materials to make the changes in attitude and strategy         needed for Shakespeare to be used more effectively in Hong Kong.
Shakespeare in Hong Kong has developed a model for change which       engages key partners, involves place-specific research and produces       low-cost materials for sustainable dissemination.
It is forming the basis       of a longer term project that tests methods and methodologies for       expansion to other countries and to other canonical figures beyond       Shakespeare.
