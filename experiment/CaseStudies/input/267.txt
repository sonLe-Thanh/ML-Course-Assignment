     The research programme has produced a `virtuous circle' of research and       impact as we have worked closely with policy and practitioner       beneficiaries to produce relevant and usable research, frequently leading       to further funded research.
The impact occurred in two phases and has been       a very strong influence on the direction of policy-making, leading to       improvements in provision for children with SLCN, and better resources for       practitioners and parents.
The first phase of impact of our research was to shape policy by       informing the 2008 Bercow Review, the first comprehensive review of       provision for children and young people with SLCN.
The Review drew       extensively on both the empirical study we conducted for the Review and on       our prior research, both documented extensively in Bercow (2008) [i].
The       Secretary of State accepted all the Bercow Review's recommendations and       approved a multifaceted action plan to improve services for children with       SLCN (&#163;12m).
Drawing on our findings, one recommendation of the Bercow       review was a programme of research `to enhance the evidence base and       inform delivery of better outcomes for children and young people'.
In the       second phase we were commissioned following a competitive process to       undertake a 3-year &#163;1.5 million research programme (reduced to &#163;1.3million       as part of the austerity cutbacks) into effectiveness and cost       effectiveness of provision for children with SLCN (DfE 2009-12), the       Better Communication Research Programme (BCRP: Lindsay PI) [8].
DfE       published 19 research reports from the BCRP (overview, 2 interim, 4       thematic, 12 technical reports) [14].
This research had 17,125 hits in the       first 4 months and has had documented effects on developing government       policy on SLCN and SEN through two main routes, considered next, and by       DfE commissioning a programme of dissemination and embedding.
First, the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Speech and Language       Difficulties (formed as a result of the 2008 Bercow Review) held an       inquiry in 2012 into the links between SLCN and social disadvantage.
The       APPG's report (2013) documents extensive reference to the BCRP reports (52       separate references).
Its Chair, Lord Ramsbotham, gave the "strongest         possible support for the excellent reports, which we hope will be         adopted and exploited by successive governments for years to come.
They         are a priceless treasure trove of information, evaluation and advice and         a credit to the work of all those who contributed to their research and         production" [iii].
Second, our research has influenced the development of legislation for       children with special educational needs (SEN), including SLCN [iv].
Proposals to reform provision for children and young people with SEN were       first set out in the SEN and disability green paper Support and         Aspiration, published in March 2011.
This drew on our BCRP Interim       Report and our separate DfE funded study of the development of support to       improve teachers' knowledge and skills on SLCN and other SEND.
In May 2011       Lindsay gave evidence to the Education Select Committee that drew on the       BCRP research and informed their 2012 scrutiny of the Green Paper.
In       autumn 2013 the Select Committee appointed Lindsay its Specialist Adviser       when conducting Pre-legislative Scrutiny of the draft Bill, described by       the DfE as 'the biggest reform in 30 years'.
The representative of       the Communication Trust drew on evidence from the BCRP when acting as       expert witness during the scrutiny of the draft Bill.
The Minister, Edward       Timpson, stated, "We are continuing to take forward many of the key         recommendations (of the BCRP), including our work with the Communication         Trust... to help to disseminate much of the good practice that         came out of that research programme and to ensure that all that is         brought together in one place, with the involvement of the royal         colleges, and used effectively and pragmatically where we know it can         make a difference on the ground..." [v]     In addition to working directly with policy-makers, our entire research       programme was designed to involve and benefit practitioners, voluntary and       community sector organisations, and LAs by providing resources to inform       their practice, use in lobbying government, and advising parents/teachers       [vi, vii].
As recommended by the Bercow Review, the Government funded a       Year of Communication (2011) led by the Government's Communication Council       (of which Lindsay is a member) and Communication Champion.
This included       three highly successful national conferences attended by over 300       practitioners and commissioners of services at which the emerging BCRP       findings were presented, (documented in the Communication Champion's final       report) [viii]; a national publicity campaign to raise awareness of SLCN;       the `Shine a Light' awards to promote outstanding practice (Lindsay a       judge), run by the Communication Trust, which has raised the profile of       SLCN organisations and schools and created a mechanism for helping to give       them credibility and prestige within the sector.
The DfE is funding a       further two year programme of practitioner development by the       Communication Trust advised by ourselves (2013-2015).
The Minister       reported, "I am aware that the practical tools for schools developed by         the better communication research programme, including those for         developing communication supporting classrooms, are being widely         disseminated by the Communication Trust as part of its work with the         Department and elsewhere" [19].
The purpose of these activities is to use the BCRP evidence to raise       awareness of SLCN, improve practitioners' knowledge and skills, and       improve practice and commissioning of services; and to inform parents       about the latest research and developments in provision that may benefit       their children [vi].These have been extensively downloaded, supported by       the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT) who have       promoted these resources to all UK SLTs after their survey found 02c390%       of their members rated it positively [ix].
We collaborated with the Communication Trust to develop web-based       versions of our What Works for SLCN?
resource (94,004 views       March-July, 02c34000 registrations) and the Communicating Supporting         Classroom Observation Tool [vii].
Lindsay works with Afasic, a       voluntary body for parents and children with SLCN, co-editing the Afasic         Abstract which disseminates research to parents, practitioners,       commissioners, and with the RCSLT to disseminate best practice to its       members [vi].
We can therefore trace the influence of our extensive research on policy       through the Bercow Review, Action Plan, and Select Committee inquiry, all       of which lead to the 2013 legislation, the Children and Families Bill       2013, and APPG report.
We can also show impact on practice by the evidence       of extensive access to and take up of BCRP materials, and testimony for       influence on practice.
