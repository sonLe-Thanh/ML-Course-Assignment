     Professor Cox's research has directly influenced the take-up of       Occupational Therapy as a key intervention in the treatment of CFS/ME.
It       has directly underpinned advances in the understanding of how fatigue       conditions are experienced in terms of occupational disruption, and has       trialled and disseminated Occupational Therapy interventions which provide       an effective treatment for this and related conditions.
Primarily, the       research has provided evidence for interventions to improve outcomes for       mild and moderate presentations of CFS, and has pioneered the use of video       conferencing to improve access to patients with more severe presentations.
It has also led to the improvement of Occupational Therapy practice       through direct engagement with practitioners and services and through       training provision of practitioner training, based on the research       insights.
Identification of the levels of occupational disruption was taken up in       the 2007 NICE guidelines, which have subsequently been implemented into       specialist services.
Subsequent work has concentrated on the effective       management through Occupational Therapy interventions, which was taken       into account during the 2011 guideline review, which specifically noted       the PACE trial as supporting the NICE guideline recommendations.
The work       therefore directly underpins the practice of managing CFS in the UK.
The       PACE trial itself also has direct implications for practice, as it       indicated that less active treatments such as APT did not have the same       impact on improvement as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Graded       Exercise Therapy (GET).
Activity Management and graded activity is a key       component of both CBT and GET.
The trial showed that when pacing is used       in isolation of other graded programmes it is less effective.
These       findings, which are further influencing practice in management of CFS, is       directly related to Professor Cox's research, as the research lead on the       APT elements of the trial.
Influence on practice and service delivery has been effected both through       direct engagement with providers of treatment and interventions (both       public and professional) and through dissemination to stakeholders through       practitioner orientated publications.

Steel K, H (2009) Using desktop videoconferencing for delivery of         CFS/ME interventions at home in the North Cumbria area: a pilot trial, 		NHS Cumbria.
The exploratory research for NHS Cumbria has been used to support the       delivery of services via video-conferencing, and as a basis to seek       further funding for this method of intervention and for further research       to support this.
Professor Cox also receives frequent requests from       practitioners for copies of these commissioned reports and articles in       practitioner orientated journals to aid in setting up the       videoconferencing approach in practice.
Such interest extends beyond       Occupational Therapy interventions for CFS, and is valued by NHS Trust       policy makers exploring telerehabilitation and telecare more widely.
The       British Journal of Occupational Therapy (BJOT) is a particularly important       tool for reaching practitioners, as the only monthly peer-reviewed       occupational therapy journal in the world, and subscribed to in over 40       countries worldwide as well as being sent monthly to all British       Association of Occupational Therapy members.
Professor Cox has directly contributed to the creation and development of       specialist CFS/ME services (such as Dorset, Chester, North Cumbria).
An       example of development of services is involvement with the Dorset CFS       service, including review of a recovery focussed programme.
For North       Cumbria CFS service this has involved piloting the use of telecare, which       particularly benefits service delivery in a region characterised by rural       and remote geography.
Other work for North Cumbria has included evaluating       the effectiveness of a mindfulness programme for adults with CFS / ME.
Impact through supporting the establishment of CFS services has included       sitting on the Department of Health CFS/ME Service Investment Steering       Group that enabled the pump priming of new services in England and through       informing the content of rehabilitation programmes for the service       including energy and activity management.
The programme has been a       catalyst to inform professionals, patients and carers nationally.
Professor Cox also provides professional supervision to a number of       individuals, directly influencing the services provided.
These individuals       practice across the country, at North Cumbria CFS/ME Service (NHS       Cumbria); South Coast Fatigue Ltd, Hampshire; ME North East, Newcastle,       and Lancashire CFS/ ME Service.
The research insights have also been disseminated directly to       practitioners through a range of professional body conferences and other       engagement events.
This includes at the College of Occupational Therapists       Annual Conference on a number of occasions, such as specific discussion of       experience of time and of telecare interventions, and at other events,       such as the International Congress on Telehealth and Telecare and the       British Association of CFS/ ME (BACME) conference.
Professor Cox has also delivered a range of continuing professional       development events within the period, including:            Chronic Fatigue Research, Cumbria &amp; Lancashire Comprehensive Local         Research Networks (CLRN) Musculoskeletal group, Lancaster University,         February 2009.

These examples include training provided to a mixed audience of Health       Professionals: Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Nurses,       Psychologists and GPs.
The research was used as a foundation for the       training and where appropriate actually demonstrated aspects of Activity       Management within GET and CBT.
The training therefore had a direct impact       on clinical practice and the shaping of evidence based services for CFS/       ME in the UK, and methodological issues of research in practice.
