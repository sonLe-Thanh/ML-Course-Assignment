     Our innovative methodologies and carefully crafted recommendations that       are rooted in rigorous evaluation and research have led to transformative       changes in three interlinked areas: integration of practices that       victim-survivors identify as most valuable into support services; more       equitable distribution of specialist support services in the statutory and       NGO sectors; enhanced criminal justice responses to victim-survivors of       rape.
The evaluations of SARCs prompted the largest expansion of statutory       services for victim-survivors of rape in contemporary history, with the       SARC model being rolled out nationally: from the three when we began the       evaluations to 33 in November 2012.
This represents an investment by       central government of more than &#163;10 million.
Recommendations that we made       with respect to key elements of a SARC were integrated into national       standards issued by the Department of Health in 2005 and 2009 e.g.
preferences among female and male victim-survivors for female forensic       examiners, a model of practice which begins from a `culture of belief' and       respect, and pro-active advocacy.
Thus the core findings from the initial       evaluation continue to inform how responses to victim-survivors of rape       are delivered.
Pro-active advocacy in particular has developed       considerably.
The Home Office and Ministry of Justice currently fund 60       Independent Sexual Violence Advisors (ISVAs) at &#163;1.72m in every year up to       2015.
The model has also been adopted with respect to domestic violence,       with 1400 Independent Domestic Violence Advisors trained in England and       Wales.
Successive government VAW action plans have continued to highlight       pro-active advocacy as a key plank of support provision.
An unprecedented       level of funding &#8212; &#163;3.3m in every year up to 2015 &#8212; accompanies this.
New       policy agendas are also recognising the importance of pro-active advocacy       e.g.
work on gangs and child sexual exploitation.
As a direct outcome of our studies on attrition the Crown Prosecution       Service (CPS) now track the progress of rape cases through their own data       systems.
The evident failings of criminal justice agencies led to a raft       of policy measures including training, guidance for prosecutors begun in       2007, and enhanced monitoring of rape cases One explanation for so many       cases failing to reach prosecution was what we termed a `culture of       scepticism' in the criminal justice system.
Recently several       senior police officers have explicitly used the concept and in 2012, in       the wake of the Jimmy Savile enquiries, the Keir Starmer, Director of       Public Prosecutions, pledged to move the CPS away from this approach to       complainants:     Professor Liz Kelly and CWASU have worked closely with the Crown         Prosecution Service since 2003... We have found them the most         influential research team on VAWG across government (Violence       Against Women Strategy Manager, Crown Prosecution Service).
The Map of Gaps research generated considerable media coverage and       debate.
When the second report was published, the Equality and Human       Rights Commission (EHRC) used the findings as an `acid test' of how local       authorities were meeting obligations under the then Gender Equality Duty.
Each local authority identified as having no specialised VAW services       (n=93) was asked to provide details of any existing or planned provision.
Those who were assessed as non-compliant with legal obligations were asked       to explain why.
The Rape Crisis Network England and Wales used the reports       in their influencing work, and as a result the current government has       invested &#163;11million to secure existing centres and open 18 new ones in the       life time of the parliament:     This document enabled us to lobby and produce policy documents around         the lack of provision nationally, but particularly highlighting the East         Region [as least resourced].
As a result, the East Region now has         a Rape Crisis Centre in every county.
This means we have been able to         address and reduce the post code lottery for women's access to         specialist support.
I would say this has been one of the most         significant impacts, in terms of service provision and policy, because         it was directly used to inform and increase service provision (Chair       of Rape Crisis Network England and Wales).
The minimum standards for specialist VAW services have been incorporated       into the 2011 Council of Europe Convention on Violence Against Women and       Domestic Violence, which now has 26 signatories, including the UK.
This       places requirements on member states to provide resources for       victim-survivors in line with our recommended standards e.g.
shelter       places, free national helplines.
The document has also been used by a       number of European networks (for example, the European Women's Lobby,       Women Against Violence Europe (WAVE), European Institute of Gender       Equality) and national NGOs to inform the development of strategies and       action plans.
UN Women are currently using the recommendations to underpin       a regional advocacy strategy on VAW support services across South Eastern       Europe.
The national strategy on gender-based violence in the Republic of       Ireland (COSC, 2010) uses the study as a starting point for assessing the       levels of support provision needed.
The influence of our research has been to define promising practices       which meet the needs of victim-survivors and embed these into a number of       policy frameworks and action plans.
In recognition of our expertise, Liz       Kelly was invited to be an expert member of the following policymaking       forums:            An inter-governmental group who used our methodology to track         attrition and develop policies to reverse the trend (2005-8),         reconstituted in 2012 by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary.
A group convened to develop guidance for judges which informed         judicial rulings in rape cases that went to appeal court (2008).
The Inter-Ministerial group overseeing delivery of the violence         against women action plan (current).
