     The WSD research was of sufficient size, breadth and quality to produce       evidence in the area previously impeded by lack of high quality research.
This evidence was adequate to inform policy and practice regarding the       introduction of tele-assistive devices into general health and social care       services.
The evidence has been influential within the DH which has in       turn influenced Government and local health and social care authorities'       policy decisions to implement tele-assistive devices.
Their impact on       service providers, consumers, service users and informal carers is now       being evidenced within the population, following the dissemination of       research findings.
The DH continues to turn to the WSD team to investigate       further evidence needs and the research has shaped decision-making on who       receives telehealth and telecare and how service provision should be       formulated.
Findings of the WSD programme are currently being acted upon by the DH       and health and social care organisations.
These include:            Briefings to MPs and DH executives that influence national health and         social care strategies policy       Consultations with NHS trusts and Social Service organisations       Collaborations and consultations with tele-assistive device research         groups and equipment suppliers       Consultations with the Royal Colleges       Consultation with European leaders and policy-makers          The above include:            John Dalli &#8212; European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Policy       Tsvetomir Svilenov &#8212; Head of Good Governance and Capacity Building,         Centre for Parliamentary Studies, Brussels       Prime Minister David Cameron's Office       The Office of the Secretary of State for Health (Andrew Lansley MP         while in post)       The Minister of State for Care Services (Paul Burstow MP while in         post)       The Telehealth All Party Parliamentary Group &#8212; Mark Garnier MP         (Chairman)       MPs and Peers: John Pugh MP, Laurence Robertson MP, Robert Pettigrew         (Office of Brian Binley MP), Baroness Masham of Ilton, Lord Boswell of         Aynho, Lord Walton of Detchant       Equipment suppliers: Nick Armistead (Bosch), John Cruickshank (2020         Health), Malcolm Luker (Philips), Hadleigh Stollar (NHS Direct), Helena         Jordan (Pfizer), Dr Alison Sundset (Philips)       Overseas governments: Danish Department of Health, Dutch and New         Zealand Governments.
WSD results have led to UK Prime Minister David Cameron's recent         announcement of plans to `roll out' advanced telehealth and telecare         solutions to the homes of three million people over the next five years,         with the aim of improving lives and putting the UK at the forefront of         global healthcare.
"Look at our approach to telehealth &#8212; getting new technology into           patients' homes so they can be monitored remotely."
"We've trialled it, it's been a huge success and now we're on a           drive to roll this out nationwide.
The aim &#8212; to improve three million           lives over the next five years.
This is going to make an extraordinary           difference to people."
The Minister of State for Care Services, Paul Burstow MP (while in         post), has discussed the cost benefits and main barriers to telehealth,         the results of some of the WSD pilot schemes and how to get patients and         clinicians on board with telecare.
Conference presentations and press briefings (including keynote         addresses by Professor Newman at the Technology Strategy Association and         The King's Fund) that have influenced further activity and key         policy-makers and service providers.
Impact indicators            Research findings have led to the executive decisions for full scale         roll out of telehealth and telecare services at a local level amongst         participating sites (including staff roles).
Department of Health policy decisions to roll out Telehealth (e.g.,         the `3 Million Lives' initiative) schemes nationally.
The DH 3ML         campaign, launched in December 2011, makes telehealth available for         three million people nationwide, aiming to improve care for patients and         deliver that care in a more efficient way.
WSD success has led to GPs' contract changes to include payments for         remote monitoring devices (via new directed enhanced services (DES) to         provide remote monitoring for patients with long-term conditions).
Advisory roles for the investigators within the telecare and         telehealth industries and service sectors, research funding committees         and professional bodies (e.g., via the Whole Systems Demonstrator Action         Network (WSDAN)).
Adoption of WSD developed patient reported outcome measures in other         tele-assistive device trials (e.g., renewing life project &#8212; www.renewinghealth.eu/).
Delivery of highly skilled people: career development of a number of         health service researchers who have acquired specialist knowledge of         telecare and telehealth deployment strategies.
Patient testimonies of the impact that telecare or telehealth systems         have had on their self-care and health status.
