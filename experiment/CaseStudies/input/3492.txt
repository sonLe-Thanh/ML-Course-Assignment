     The research had impact by enhancing the training facilities of the       British Army, reducing wastage       in training, and enhancing the mental health and performance of       soldiers-in-training.
From 2008, it       benefitted the organisation, and all recruits, as evidenced by the       specific impacts that follow.
Numbers in superscript refer to particular sources to corroborate the       impact (in section 5).
In 2008, informed by the above research, the Army Recruiting and Training       Division (ARTD)       established the Army Staff Leadership School (ASLS) with the remit of       training all non-commissioned       officers that received training postings in transformational leadership       and coaching       skills.
The British Army uses non-commissioned officers to train       approximately 10,000 new recruits       each year.
These non-commissioned officers are trained to deliver that       training by ASLS.
All Army       trainers get posted back into active service after two years.
Thus, by         enhancing the coaching         and leadership skills of trainers, the whole organisation has been         influenced 1, 2, 3, 4.
In 2010, Arthur and Hardy advised on revisions to the ASLS programme.
Arthur also led a group of       IRESE staff (Arthur, Beattie, Hardy J, Roberts, and Lawrence) who       subsequently delivered staff       development training to enable ASLS staff to deliver their revised       programme 3.
The original research was widely reported &#8212; in particular in a Lead       Article in the Times Higher         Education Supplement on 4 November 2005 5, and in the       August 2005 issue of The Soldier       magazine 6, which has a circulation of 100,000.
The Bangor         model of leadership and coaching         also holds a central position in the Army Recruiting and Training         Division's booklet `A         Guide to Leadership in the ARTD' published in 2009 1, 8.
In 2011, Hardy was invited to review and comment on the Army's new       leadership doctrine       document which was being prepared by the Royal Military Academy.
The       document, Developing         Leaders: A Sandhurst Guide (2012), references the Bangor model of       leadership in paragraphs 502       and 518 1, 9.
The Royal Marines adopted the Bangor coaching and leadership model       for the delivery of       training to their recruits prior to 2008 and still use it to the present       day.
Consequently, it impacts         1250 Royal Marines recruits each year 1, 2, 4.
The 2006 tri-service review of the use and effectiveness of coaching       across the UK Armed       Services [Patrick, J., Ahmed, A., Hodgetts, H., Hutchings, P., Morgan, P.,       Scrase, G., Tombs, M. &amp;       Watts, H. (2006).
Effectiveness of coaching techniques in military       training.
Ministry of Defence,       Contract No.
RT/COM/4/008] used the Bangor model as a cornerstone for its       assessment and       found that 92% of the critical incidents they examined could be mapped         onto the Bangor         model.
In 2007, the Tri-Service Defence Centre of Training and       Support (DCTS) was established       to define and validate the standards that training organisations in the       three Armed Services in the       UK have to meet.
Since 2008, DCTS has also adopted the Bangor model for         the delivery of         coaching and leadership training across the Armed Services 1,         4.
Phrases now in common use across training establishments in the Armed         Services were         adopted directly from the research and associated reports &#8212; for       instance "Train in, not select       out" (encouraging trainers to focus on training rather than testing       recruits), "Vision, Support,       Challenge" (summarising transformational leadership) 1, 4.
Hardy presented the results of the initial research to: the Director       General of the Royal Marines'       Board (2002); the Annual Conference of the ARTD (2003 and 2004); the       Director General of       ATRD's Board (2005 and 2007); and the Deputy Adjutant General for the Army       (2007).
During the       current REF period, impact has also been reinforced via presentation to       the Adjutant General for       the whole Army (2008); and the DCTS Tri-Service symposium on Coaching and       leadership (2008).
He also delivered keynote addresses on the research at: the Infantry       Battle School's annual Cross       Brief (2008, 2010 and 2012); the Annual Conference of the Initial Training       Group (2010); and the       ASLS Commanding Officer's Conference on Coaching (2011).
Arthur gave a       keynote address to       the ASLS Commanding Officer's Conference on Coaching in 2012.
These       presentations all       underpin and underline the impact 1, 2, 3.
The posts of the key influencers utilised in the research were converted       into permanent positions at       the Commando Training Centre Royal Marines Lympstone and the Infantry       training centre at       Catterick when the research was completed 1, 4,.
The level of       knowledge of these teams has       surprised independent observers 7.
Indicators of extended impact include: (i) The British Army trains       recruits and non-commissioned       officers from a number of other Commonwealth countries using the Bangor       model.
(ii) British Army       trainers have presented invited workshops to the Canadian and United       States armed services on       the delivery of the Bangor model 1, 4.
Four further PhD studentships in IRESE funded by external sponsors have       made use of the       Bangor model in high level sport (Sports Council for Wales, 2009), outdoor       activities (Knowledge       Economy Skills Scholarships, 2010), and higher education delivery (the       Drapers Trust, 2009 and       Higher Education Academy, 2013).
Thus the reach of the research is now       extending beyond the       original populations of study.
