     Terminology work within nursing has been ongoing for several decades.
Prior to the application of the research that underpins this case study,       the development and maintenance of nursing terminologies was a largely       manual process.
Hardiker's research in the use of description logics,       specifically the application of OWL to explore the utility of statements       that describe nursing diagnoses and nursing-sensitive patient outcomes,       marked a leap forward.
The use of automated reasoning has assured       correctness and consistency among a significantly expanded term set,       opening up new horizons in terms of scale, demonstrating high efficiency       and effectiveness without impacting negatively on resources:             ICNP classifies patient data and clinical activity in the domain of         nursing and is used for decision-making and policy development aimed at         improving health status and health care delivery.
ICNP improves         communication and statistical reporting practices across health services         and remains the only international production standardised nursing         terminologies to be underpinned with a formal foundation.
ICNP has         promoted harmonisation with other widely used standards, made visible         nursing's contribution to health and health care globally and improved         healthcare and patient outcomes.
The utility and efficiency of ICNP is demonstrated by the level of         uptake, ICNP is available in 16 languages (with Swedish, Icelandic and         Slovenian also in progress):                 Brazilian-Portuguese          Chinese (traditional)          English          Farsi          French          German          Italian          Indonesian          Japanese          Korean          Mandarin          Norwegian          Polish          Portuguese          Romanian          Spanish               This significant translation effort has been largely voluntary with         individuals and national organisation seeing the potential benefits of         ICNP and investing resources to facilitate national adoption.
Emerging as a national standard for nursing in a number of countries,         ICNP is recognised by the American           Nurses association as an interface terminology that supports         nursing practice.
The Canadian           Nurses Association (CNA) endorses ICNP for documenting         professional nursing practice in Canada.
CNA has developed mapping         between ICNP and its own outcomes measurement instrument, the Canadian         Health Outcomes for Better Information and Care (C-HOBIC).
Brazil is establishing national endorsement and adoption.
The Portuguese           version of ICNP (Classifica&#231;&#227;o Internacional para a Pr&#225;tica de         Enfermagem - CIPE) is now widely used in software applications within         the Portuguese national health system (SNS).
ICNP has been promoted as         the preferred nursing terminology within Portugal for over 10 years; all         Portuguese Government-funded nursing information systems are required to         be ICNP-compliant.
Iceland has recently relinquished its reliance on other nursing         terminologies in favour of ICNP.
A related terminology is the multidisciplinary SNOMED Clinical Terms         (CT).
SNOMED CT is based on a different foundational technology to ICNP.
However, it uses ICNP as its nursing reference.
A formal Harmonisation         Agreement is now in place and a representative of ICN is formally         constituted as Vice-Chair within the Nursing Special Interest Group of         the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation         to ensure consistency between these two international terminologies.
This is an important strategic relationship that will ensure that users         of ICNP are integrated within the wider multi-disciplinary informatics         infrastructure.
The World Health Organisation accepted ICNP within the Family of         International Classifications (WHO-FIC) to extend coverage of the domain         of nursing practice as an essential and complementary part of         professional health services.
ICNP is the only nursing-specific         terminology within the Family.
ICNP can be used as a classification, in         conjunction with other WHO-FIC classifications, wherever such care is         provided.
A mapping agreement has been developed between ICNP and         another member of WHO-FIC, the International Classification of         Functioning.
ICNP is also strongly influencing the development of the         multidisciplinary International Classification of Health Interventions         (ICHI).
The 11th revision of the WHO International         Classification of Diseases has broken convention in adopting a formal         approach that is similar to ICNP to underpin the terminology; other         terminologies within WHO-FIC are likely to follow suit in the future.
The research that underpins ICNP strongly influenced work on         international technical health informatics standards.
For example, it is         cited in the International Standard ISO 18104: `Integration of a         reference terminology model for nursing', published in 2003.
ISO 18104         establishes a nursing reference terminology model consistent with the         goals and objectives of other specific health terminology models in         order to provide a more unified reference health model.
This         International Standard includes the development of reference terminology         models for nursing diagnoses and nursing actions and relevant         terminology and definitions for its implementation.
ICNP has been         consulted throughout the recent revision of the standard.
Hardiker continues to play an active role in formal standardisation         efforts, contributing to terminology-related standards activity within         ISO, the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), the British         Standards Institute (BSI) and the International Medical Informatics         Association (IMIA).
Hardiker was invited to join the Nursing Peer Group of the National         Advisory Group to the UK NHS Connecting for Health Programme, England's         Chief Nursing Officer's Next Stage Review Nursing and Midwifery Advisory         Board and its successor, the National Nursing Informatics Strategic         Taskforce and is a founder member of the Steering Committee of the         Vanderbilt University Nursing Terminology Summit, a US-based `think         tank', providing global strategic direction for research and development         around terminologies, and Chair of the Health Information Systems         Society (HIMSS) Europe Governing Council.
