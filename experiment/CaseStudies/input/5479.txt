     Process from research to impact:     Recognition of the Strathclyde research's conclusions in relation to the       complex issues of historical       abuse, its consequences in terms of physical, sexual, emotional abuse and       neglect, programme       abuse, and systems abuse, and the importance of applying the lessons       learnt to current policy and       practice in residential child care was a central component of the Shaw       Review in 2007.
This       review, chaired by Tom Shaw, was set up by the Scottish Government with an       explicit remit to       examine historical abuse in residential child care, the systems of laws,       rules and regulations and       their implementation and compliance, and their connections with historical       abuse (1950-1995).
Kendrick's previous research findings on abuse of children in care &#8212; the       need for appropriate       selection of and training for residential care staff, the need to find       ways to communicate about       abuse for particularly vulnerable groups of children in residential care,       and the gaps in evidence in       relation to the monitoring and inspection of services in the past &#8212; led to       him being commissioned to       provide an expert review of the national and international literature on       historical abuse as part of       the Shaw Review (Source 1).
As Shaw has indicated, the Strathclyde       research had a direct and       material impact on the review: "The research and advice contributed         directly to the findings of the         Systemic Review and to the specific recommendations addressing: current         provision to inform the         welfare and safety of looked after and accommodated children; former         residents' needs; and,         records" (Source 2).
Shaw's recommendations led to a number of       significant developments in       policy, practice and legislation in Scotland.
Types of impact: The research carried out at Strathclyde which       informed the Shaw Review, and       subsequent research, have led to concrete actions and impacts both in       relation to interventions to       address the needs of adults who have experienced abuse as children in       residential care, and in       relation to current residential care services, ensuring that the lives of       those who have experienced       residential care are improved.
Through the continuing involvement of the       Strathclyde researchers       in the process by which policy, practice and services have been developed       and improved, the       research has had both a direct and indirect impact on improvements in       residential child care and       the health and well-being of children and young people.
Impacts on public policy, law and services: The Shaw Review's       recommendations on current       residential care led to the establishment of the National Residential       Child Care Initiative (NRCCI)       (Source 3) led by SIRCC and underpinned by Strathclyde's research.
This       led the Scottish       Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) to       identify five areas of       action: care planning; workforce; commissioning; improving learning       outcomes; and improving       health outcomes (Source 3).
A specific impact of NRCCI was the decision by       Scottish Government       to expand the role of SIRCC to cover all looked after children and to       develop a new Centre for       Excellence for Looked After Children in Scotland (CELCIS).
To take this       forward for all looked after       children, SIRCC was replaced by CELCIS.
This new Centre is providing       greater awareness of child       protection and safeguarding children in care, enhanced training, and       collaborative working to       support those who care for looked after children.
Impacts on practitioners and professional services: One strand of       the NRCCI focused on the       residential workforce and this is one of the five areas of action.
Building on Strathclyde's research,       the workforce hub has developed an enhanced qualification for residential       workers and supervisors       and this is currently awaiting Scottish Government Ministerial approval.
CELCIS has also       developed up-to-date training materials and launched the We Can and         Must Do Better website for       everyone in Scotland concerned with improving the outcomes for looked       after children, care       leavers and their families (Source 4).
Health and welfare impacts: Following the Shaw Review, the       Scottish Government piloted a       confidential committee to hear the experiences of adults who had       experienced abuse in care &#8212;       Time to be Heard Pilot Forum.
Strathclyde researchers were involved       in the evaluation of the pilot       (Source 5) and in undertaking a scoping study for a National Confidential       Forum.
Subsequently,       the proposals for the development of the National Confidential Forum were       contained within the       Victims and Witness (Scotland) Bill published in 2013 (Source 6).
Broader       conclusions of the       research in relation to participation and voice have been addressed       through a Human Rights       Framework for Historic Abuse in Scotland developed by the Scottish Human       Rights Commission       (Source 7).
This has been taken forward, with the involvement of CELCIS       and the Strathclyde       researchers, through an InterAction on Historic Child Abuse       (Source 8) which has brought together       all key stakeholders: agencies that had historically provided residential       or foster care of children,       Scottish Government, professionals currently involved in the care of       children, faith-based       organisations, academics, and, importantly, representatives of survivors       of historic abuse.
An       Action Plan on Justice for Victims of Historic Abuse of Children in         Care has been circulated widely       to relevant organisations in Scotland, for consideration about future       commitments.
Reach and Significance: Implementation of the Strathclyde research       has resulted in       improvements and safeguards not only for those children and young people       who are currently       being looked after in residential and foster care (approximately 7,000),       but also those in other       settings such as hospitals, boarding schools, school hostels (a further       5,000).
The beneficiaries       also include those adults who experienced care as children, particularly       survivors/victims of       historical abuse.
The number of those who experienced care in the past is       unclear due to lack of       statistics and records, and identifying the number of survivors/victims of       abuse is even more       problematic due to shame, stigma and lack of evidence.
In carrying out a       scoping study for the       establishment of a National Confidential Forum, the Strathclyde       researchers estimated that since       1930 almost half a million children have been in care in Scotland, and       over 300,000 of these are       still alive today.
International estimates for the level of historical       abuse of children in care ranges       from 3 per cent to 10 per cent.
The impact is also significant for professionals currently working in       care settings and in providing       services for those who continue to suffer the consequences of abuse       throughout their lives.
The       Strathclyde researchers' work in this area is also currently being used in       developments in relation       to historical abuse in Finland and the Netherlands.
The Professor of       Implementation in Youth Care       at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences notes that "research by         Professor Andrew Kendrick         at the University of Strathclyde has had a direct impact on the         development of quality guidelines to         prevent for (sexual) child abuse in residential and foster care in The         Netherlands.
The guidelines         were developed by the Dutch employers' organisation in Youth Care and         supervised by a special         committee of which I am a member" (Source 9).
A Professor of Social       Work at the University of       Tampere, Finland notes that "research by Professor Andrew Kendrick at         the University of         Strathclyde has had a direct and material impact on the plan to study         historic abuse in Finland         which I have contributed to as a member of the planning group introduced         by the Ministry of Social         Welfare and Health.
His work has guided us to suggest a framework of         justice and human rights."
