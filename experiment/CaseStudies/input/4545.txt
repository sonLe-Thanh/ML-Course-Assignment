     Film festivals, museum exhibitions and over 1,000 public events have       emanated from this research to generate audiences of 15.9 million (an       increase of over 100% since 2007).
A further audience of 12.4 million has       been created through inclusion of material within national and       international broadcasts (source 5.1).
This impact has been achieved       through sustained collaborations between SASE and Cinecity with 6 local       authorities as well as Arts Council England (ACE) and the British Film       Institute (BFI).
Created new audiences for marginalised film and impacted upon wider         public life: As the first collection dedicated to moving images of       20th-century life in south east England, SASE has generated       demand for images from broadcasters that regularly select and purchase       films for inclusion in their programmes, for example, WWII in HD: The         Lost Films (USA, 2009) and Apocalypse (France, 2009), which       were both screened worldwide (5.2).
Curators also make regular use of the       collection, selecting SASE films on 36 occasions for permanent displays       and temporary exhibitions in museums, galleries and international       institutions.
These include the National Gallery of Art, Washington       (2008), the National Museum of World Culture, Gothenburg (2008) and le       Musee d'Histoire de la Ville de Luxembourg (2011).
Overall visitor figures       are estimated at 2,772,700 for permanent displays and 519,814 for       temporary exhibitions (5.1).
Established in 2003, the Cinecity festival presents a global mix of       premieres and previews, artists' cinema, archive film, talks and debates.
With attendance figures rising annually, attendance has risen by 30% in       the period for ticketed events with unprecedented figures for its free       events in public spaces (450,000 viewed its exhibition on the making of Brighton         Rock in 2012) (5.1).
According to the Guardian, the 2012       Cinecity festival programme was `one of the strongest and most diverse'       and should be `admired for its eclectic programme' (5.3).
GRAY's curation       Capturing Colour: Film, Invention &amp; Wonder (Brighton Museum       &amp; Art Gallery, 2010) represented another facet of SASE's public       engagement and wider impact.
Supported by the AHRC (&#163;53k), UK Film Council       (&#163;20k) and Renaissance (&#163;28k), the exhibition attracted 51,471 visitors       and was accompanied by an extensive programme of events for adults and       children.
It was described by Child Friendly Brighton as `an impressive       exhibition for all the family to discover the significance and magic of       colour on film' (5.4).
A direct impact of the exhibition has been the       commitment by the Brighton Museum to create a new film and media gallery       `that will engage and inspire hundreds of thousands of visitors each year'       (5.5).
SASE's collection of largely non-fiction material represents and connects       with the past through associations with memory, identity and place.
Indicative of this are over 500 invitations received by SASE to present       its work from history and heritage societies (eg the National Trust,       Saddlescombe Farm Museum, 2012), University of the Third Age (eg U3A       Science Group, Crowborough, 2013), galleries (eg Whitechapel Art Gallery,       London, 2009 and The Lab Gallery, New York, 2011), museums (eg People's       History Museum, Manchester, 2012-13) and festivals (eg Brighton White       Night Festival, 2009 and Dresden International Short Film Festival, 2011).
Complementing and extending its reach, GRAY has appeared 22 times on       regional, national and European media, contributing to the BBC's popular       series Coast (2009) and a German documentary on Brighton for the       European ARTE channel (2012) (5.6).
Shaped national and public policy on screen heritage: Informing       both national and local screen policy, GRAY's research led to his       membership of the group that prepared the `Strategy for UK Screen       Heritage' for Government, leading to the Department for Culture, Media,       &amp; Sport (DCMS) investing &#163;25m (2009-2011), the largest public award       ever made to the sector.
As a result, &#163;247k of new funding was distributed       to each region of England (5.7).
In 2012, Brighton &amp; Hove City Council       committed itself to Film City.
Led by GRAY and dedicated to creating a       cluster for film-related research, heritage, exhibition, production and       tourism in the city, the Head of Arts for Brighton &amp; Hove City Council       noted that `Frank's work as an historian, archive director and as a       cultural leader in the City is continuing to elevate film's importance to       our city's culture and economy' (5.8).
The &#163;1.8m of sustained support that SASE and Cinecity have received from       ACE, AHRC, UK Film Council/British Film Institute, Heritage Lottery Fund,       DCMS and EU is indicative of how these funders value this public work.
This income has created 16.8 full-time employment years at a cost of       &#163;400,189 and a spend of &#163;351,987 on procurement.
Extending this is the BFI       award of &#163;900k in July 2013 to create an Audience Development Hub for the       region to lead its film culture (5.9).
