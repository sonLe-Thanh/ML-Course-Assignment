     i.
Articles and interviews in mainstream media generating public         responses and awards       Campbell published an accessible 2000-word article on his research for the       Irish Times (2 April 2011) (readership: 100,000), and gave a series       of interviews on his research to other media, including: a two page       interview in Hot Press (14 April 2011), Ireland's leading music       magazine; an interview in the Irish Independent (29 July 2011)       (readership: 134,000); a 25 minute interview on the Dave Fanning Show       (RT&#201; 2 FM, 23 April 2011) (audience: 100,000); a 10 minute interview on       the prestigious arts programme, Culture File (RT&#201; Lyric FM, 2       April 2011); interviews on Today with Pat Kenny (RT&#201; Radio 1, 25       April 2011) (audience: 70,000), The Irish Abroad (RT&#201; Radio 1, 26       June 2011), Arts Extra (Radio Ulster, 11 April 2011), Alison         Curtis Show (Phantom FM, 30 March 2011), Tom Dunne       (Newstalk, 5 April 2011), and Made in Britain (BBC Radio Four, 12       June 2012) (audience: 400,000).
These activities generated positive public       responses via social media, including Tweets praising Campbell's research       as `fascinating' (see Section 5.i).
Campbell also spoke about his research       on the BBC Radio Four programme, Follow-Up Albums (17 May 2012)       (audience: 1.1 million), which focused on Dexys Midnight Runners' Don't Stand Me Down, an       album that Campbell analysed in his book.
The       programme generated positive public responses via social media, with       Tweets describing Campbell's research as `incredibly eye-opening' (see       Section 5.i).
Moreover, when Dexys released a new album in 2012, members       of the public used social media to connect the record's themes with those       of Campbell's book (see Section 5.ii), showing that the book had enriched       appreciation of culture.
The research presented in Campbell's book was       also discussed in the mainstream media, demonstrating the transition of       his work into the public realm.
In this context, positive accounts of his       book appeared in the Sunday Times (Ireland) (1 May 2011)       (readership: 108,000), Irish Times (2 December 2011) (readership:       100,000), MOJO (August 2011) (readership: 240,000), Belfast         Telegraph (19 June 2011), Irish Independent (11 June 2011),       Irish Examiner (14 May 2011), Sunday Business Post (1 May       2011) and the Irish Post (30 April 2011).
Non-academic blogs and       websites also engaged with Campbell's book, noting that his research was       `perspective-shifting' and addressed a topic that `has had sparse       attention ... until the arrival of this book' (see Section 5.iii).
These       online responses generated Tweets and Re- Tweets (see Section 5.iii).
In       addition, fans of the musicians addressed in the book (as well as some of       the musicians themselves) engaged in discussions of the book on websites,       showing that Campbell's research had increased appreciation of culture       (see Section 5.iv).
The engagements with Campbell's research outlined       above had the effect of increasing the level of public debate about       second-generation Irish experience and creative expression in England.
The       public significance of Campbell's work was underlined when his book was       named Music Book of the Year in the Sunday Times (Ireland) (4 Dec       2011) and in the Hot Press Annual (2012), a rare accolade for an       academic text.
This serves as evidence of the fact that Campbell's       research was registered and praised in the public realm.
ii.
Public talks increasing public understanding and generating public         responses       Campbell presented his research in a range of public forums, including at       Headingley LitFest (8 March 2013), in a talk co-organised by the Irish       Arts Foundation, an Irish community organisation in Leeds.
The talk took       place at the Headingley Enterprise and Arts Centre, and was advertised in       local media, such as the Yorkshire Evening Post (6 Mar 2013),       attracting 44 attendees.
The organisers collated audience comments, all of       which were positive, and showed that Campbell's talk had increased       understanding of the experience and expressive cultures of the Irish       diaspora in England.
The full comments (available from the HEI on request)       include the following:            `This evening explored the ambivalence &amp; ambiguity of the         immigrant's child in a very thought- provoking way.
An intellectual         journey that makes you review the lyrics of many songs!!
Great stuff';       `V. interesting - look forward to reading the book.
Interesting         insight into Anglo-Irish relations';       `Really excellent explanation through music of how it feels to be         second generation Irish in England, a side I as an English person had         little knowledge of.
Very enlightening towards understanding';       `An entertaining &amp; knowledgeable talk about how 2nd generation         Irish musicians felt about being here and what they did with their music         to express their feelings.
I learned a great deal';       `Thoroughly interesting and absorbing delivered by one who has         researched in depth.
Raised a lot of issues which look as if they are         going to be pursued further by members of the audience, excellent!'
Campbell's talk at Headingley also generated online responses, such as       blog entries, which show evidence of his work's impact on public       understanding of this topic.
These included the following: `On the ninth       of March I met a lady who had attended this talk.
She is married to an       Irishman and she told me how the insights given by Dr. Sean Campbell had       helped her understand her husband's experience of life in this country       more closely "because he would never talk about it himself".
Such was the       impact of this humorous and knowledgeable speaker ... During the lively       Q&amp;A session that followed ... it was clear that Dr. Campbell had       touched the sensibilities of his full- house audience many of whom were       ... second (or even third or fourth) generation Irish' (http://headingleylitfest.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/dwellers-on-threshold-dr-sean-campbell.html).
Campbell also presented his research at other public talks, including at       `Culture Night', an Irish community event at London's Shortwave Cinema (23       September 2011) that attracted 70 attendees.
The event's convenor provides       evidence of Campbell's impact in a letter (available from the HEI on       request) which includes the following: `Sean's talk expertly and       insightfully bridged the gap between many people on this Culture Night       which, in my role as programmer and producer, was ideal - the theme of the       evening was `nasc', the Irish for connection.
It was wonderful to see       people from many walks of life and from such varying ages, intensely       debate the topics and questions posed from Sean's talk.
In this regard,       his position as a keynote speaker provided immense and lasting work to the       evening and all that followed'.
In 2012, Ireland's Department of Foreign       Affairs invited Campbell to speak about his book at the Irish Embassy in       London.
At the event (12 June 2012), the Ambassador discussed the book's       themes, before Campbell gave a talk to the attendees, who included       high-profile figures from the realms of politics, media and music (see       Section 5.vii).
This invite, and the talk Campbell gave in this forum,       evidences that his work was registered, and valued, at governmental as       well as public levels.
iii.
Series Advisor role on TV documentary series generating public         responses and informing public debate       In 2011 Campbell was appointed Series Advisor on Guth: Musical Sons of         the Irish Diaspora, a six- part television documentary series       broadcast on TG4, a public service broadcaster for Irish- language       speakers, in 2013 (see Section 5.viii).
The series drew on the themes and       ideas of Campbell's book in its exploration of the role of Irish ethnicity       in the lives and work of musicians of Irish descent.
Campbell advised the       producers in face-to-face meetings, phone discussions and e- mail       exchanges, and was interviewed on camera, appearing in the series as an       onscreen contributor (particularly in episodes 3-5), discussing material       from his book.
The primary stage of impact (of Campbell's research       informing a TV series) was extended when the series reached an audience of       approx.
100,000 in Ireland, generating a positive public response, with       responses on social media showing that the series had enriched       appreciation of culture.
This is evinced in the following Twitter       comments:            `great tv "Guth", Irish connections with musicians, reflecting on         class, race &amp; identity'         (https://twitter.com/SorchaGeoghegan/status/391179136712318976);       `Excellent series exploring the music icon offsprings of Irish         emigrants'         (https://twitter.com/MaireDineen01/status/391194869714001923);       `If you get the chance look out for Guth on @TG4TV re Brit bands with         strong Irish heritage - Smiths Oasis Dexys Costello Lydon'         (https://twitter.com/Neekyatn/status/393661528747962368);       `Repeat of the Smiths documentary "Guth " on TG4 at 11.50pm tonight.
Explores the Irish ancestry and influences of the band.
Very good'         (https://twitter.com/joeneville2010/status/392379571783610369);       `Best show on Irish TV in years'         (https://twitter.com/talkirish/status/392969071928832000);       `Excellent Irish tv.
The best Irish programme I've seen on tv in ages.
It deserves more publicity'         (https://twitter.com/theScreamS/status/390949594999570432);       `Fantastic programme'         (https://twitter.com/AnalogueCatalog/status/392361381296496640).
The         series also informed public debates about the Irish diaspora in England,         with newspaper articles on this topic directly citing the material         presented in the series.
One such article, in the Irish Independent         (readership: 120,000), observed: `this phenomenon of kids who were seen         as Irish by the English, and vice versa, and how this could be a         powerful creative force.
But I would now see it as being more complex         again than that.
They say that from time to time an Irish writer like,         say, Brendan Behan, emerges to give the English theatre a blast of         energy, and yet it is also true to say that the English theatre is         always there to recognise the raw talent of a Behan, to help turn his         ideas into actual plays.
Likewise, The Smiths, subjects of last week's         Guth, had eight Irish-born parents between the four of them.
So we need         to understand that this relationship with Britain has been far more         mutually beneficial than is generally admitted.
That for all the         ass-kicking that the sons of Erin have administered to British culture,         it is also virtually unknown for the Irish to become internationally         successful without some significant contribution from a friendly         neighbour.
So the Smiths, brought up in the Irish community in         Manchester, might have felt this separateness from England, but then         most artists, everywhere, feel a bit separate from their surroundings.
Again, I would prefer to join with Guth in rejoicing in such         complications, rather than to regret their intrusion on a more         simplistic nationalist narrative' (see Section 5.ix for reference).
This         newspaper article shows how Campbell's research - through its         transposition into a TV documentary series - informed public debates.
The engagement initiatives outlined above had a wide public reach in the         UK and Ireland, increasing understanding of the experience and         expressive cultures of the Irish diaspora in England.
