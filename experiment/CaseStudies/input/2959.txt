     The principal area of impact has been in current policy debates on the         future of flood insurance in the UK.
The report was particularly       opportune, as flood insurance policy is currently under review by the       Department for Environment Food &amp; Rural Affairs (DEFRA), with their       initial 2011 report `Flood Risk and Insurance: A Roadmap to 2013 and       Beyond' arguing for a free market in flood insurance that is fully       sensitive to risks of flooding.
This position was criticised by John       O'Neill and Martin O'Neill in their JRF report [A] that the JRF noted "is         important as it is a clear example of where social justice         considerations need to be taken into consideration in policy development         in light of climate change and where the issues need addressing         together" [1].
The JRF report was the first to systematically examine underlying       principles of justice that could be invoked in the justification of       different insurance regimes.
This was integrated into a detailed       discussion of the existing distribution of flood insurance, alongside       international comparisons of different insurance systems.
Earlier versions       of the report were commented on by key players in the debates, in       particular the National Flood Forum (NFF), the Morpeth Flood Action Group       (MFAG) and the Association of British Insurers (ABI).
The latter noted       that the report "helped a variety of stakeholders (insurers, community         groups etc.)
elucidate their feelings about what is the `right approach'         to dealing with catastrophic flood risk in the UK, in a professional and         credible way.
The thorough discussion of different concepts of         `fairness', has provided proponents of `pooling solutions', such as the         ABI, with reassurance that they are making the right arguments and         chasing the right solutions to what is a very difficult and emotive         problem...
The JRF report was, and continues to be, a very helpful and         timely piece of work for the ABI internally... [I]t is always reassuring         to know that the principles of a policy proposal have credible academic         backing" [2].
At the time the JRF report was published, those speaking on behalf of       flooded communities, such as NFF and MFAG, were together with the ABI       arguing for different versions of more solidaristic schemes, as against       the free market position that was emerging from DEFRA.
The JRF report was       launched (after DEFRA's report) to the NFF conference `Insurance,       Communities, Flood Risk: What Will the Future Hold?'
(7th March       2012).
As JRF confirm, alongside representatives from the insurance       industry, "the event was attended by Defra Minister Richard Benyon,         Shadow Minister Gavin Shuker and Liberal Democrat Stephen Gilbert.
All         were made aware of the report, Gavin Shuker endorsed it and the Minister         promised to follow up on it" [1].
As the NFF Chief Executive       explains: "The launch of the report at the National Flood Forum         conference was timely... [It] provided an explicit dimension,         social justice, that lies at the heart of the concept of insurance, but         which is rarely articulated.
The portrayal of different aspects of         social justice allowed people to better understand some of its         complexity, but also to consider what insurance is for and how the         different models address this.
The report also demonstrated to         Government that there was an academic underpinning to the views of         stakeholders... [S]ocial justice has been at the heart of the debate         over the last year, with ministers repeatedly asserting that they wish         to put in place something rather better than the existing Statement of         Principle, so this work has been particularly influential in supporting         the debate."
The research enabled the NFF to develop a `consensus       note, delivered to DEFRA in March 2013.
Commenting on the JRF report, the       NFF chairman noted that: "whatever the new [Secretary of State] eventually         decides, I am convinced that this had a significant impact on the policy         makers" [3].
During the period March 2012-June 2013, John O'Neill and Martin O'Neill       have been in ongoing discussions about the future of insurance policy with       MFAG and JRF.
As the JRF programme manager verifies: "The JRF raised         the issues at a national coastal erosion and flood risk management forum         convened by Defra and the EA and subsequently the JRF and research team         were invited to discussions with Defra, HMT and other stakeholders       [including NFF and ABI] about the issue to share perspectives as part         of policy development" [1].
Meetings were also held with the Labour       Party's shadow ministerial team, with Gavin Shukar MP (Shadow Minister for       Water and Waste) making a number of references to the JRF report       influencing Labour Party policy on the future of flood insurance.
He       notes: "Leaving this issue to the free market ducks the challenge of         fairness and equity.
It is simply untenable to leave homes and         businesses to unfettered risk from flooding.
This issue of fairness         ...is one made well by Martin O'Neill and John O'Neill...
They make the         case for a government as an arbiter of fairness in determining a         societal view of flood risk [4].
The JRF report continued to have a significant impact on discussions       between DEFRA, H.M. Treasury, the insurance industry and the major flood       action groups.
Indeed, MFAG testimony &#8212; from a meeting between the NFF and       the ABI &#8212; noted: "It was agreed that the JRF report has altered the         playing field.
Defra and HMT are only too aware of this" [5].
The       report was also successful in influencing wider debates around climate       justice, appearing in a Guardian newspaper article that quoted the NFF       Chairman's assertion that the JRF report "gives overwhelming weight to         the case for government to step up to the plate to ensure that the         market in flood insurance is fair and equitable.
On present evidence         they need to do more" [6].
As he subsequently elucidated, the work       was vital in shaping the debate at a pivotal moment during 2012, assisting       the NFF "by developing the intellectual argument for social justice in         flood insurance &#8212; something we believed to be true but could not have         presented in the way [the report] did" [3].
Longer pieces       have also appeared in specialist magazines, such as Energy &amp;         Environmental Management [6].
In June 2013, DEFRA announced a new agreement that "after         negotiations with the Association of British Insurers (ABI)... replaces         the current `Statement of Principles' that runs out at the end of July         and will bring peace of mind to people who will soon need to renew their         insurance.
The new agreement will cap flood insurance premiums, linking         them to council tax bands so that people will know the maximum they will         have to pay.
To fund this, a new industry-backed levy will enable         insurance companies to cover those at most risk of flooding.
All UK         household insurers will have to pay into this pool, creating a fund that         can be used to pay claims for people in high-risk homes."
[7].
The       new agreement is a compromise document which in the short term rules out a       fully risk sensitive market in insurance and introduces a form of       cross-subsidy from low to high risk households.
The NFF chief executive       was cautiously optimistic: "What we don't have are answers to the         impact on households, and how affordable and accessible this scheme will         be for people, and whether it protects those who are vulnerable...
However, this is the preferred approach because it actually does what         insurance is supposed to do, which is providing cover for everybody and         sharing risk between them, whereas other models didn't do this" [8]       However, the government has retained its view that in the longer term       policy should shift towards a market-based approach that is fully-risk       sensitive.
Ongoing work by John O'Neill and Martin O'Neill continues to       influence the development of JRF's critical response to this aspect of the       new agreement, in particular through the Government's own consultation on       the policy and related draft flood insurance clauses in the new Water Bill       2013-2014 (HC Bill 82).
Additional impacts have followed around biodiversity protection and         environmental compensation.
Internal reports for EJOLT have dealt       with questions concerning the consistency of NGO critiques of the monetary       valuation of environmental goods in the context of both cost-benefit       analyses, and the acceptance of monetary damages in legal compensation       cases.
O'Neill's contribution considered a legal case against Texaco in       Ecuador, arguing that contrary to some economic theories, the two       attitudes present &#8212; forward-looking cases of cost-benefit analysis, and       backward-looking cases involving compensatory justice &#8212; are consistent.
This has informed several NGOs.
Accion Ecologica in Ecuador note       that it has assisted them in developing a response to compensation cases       in the context of Ecuador's constitutional recognition of: "nature as         a subject of rights... include[ing] that the right to         restoration should be independent of the obligation of the State,         private individuals or corporations, to compensate the individuals and         communities affected" [9].
Similarly, the UK NGO Cornerhouse has       recognised the value of the work, noting that: "O'Neill's analysis of         the vexed question of how environmental movements can consistently         criticize cost-benefit analysis while at the same time defending claims         for monetary compensation for past harms is very useful for current         debates within the environmental movement and between environmentalists         and their opponents.
Among other things, it helps activists avoid being         wrong-footed by opponents who insist that they must either give up their         opposition to being `bought off' or forgo claims to monetary         compensation for past damages" [10].
