     The main areas of impact of the research as set out in section two are as       follows:            Impacts on public policy: policy decisions have been informed, control         measures for infections have improved       On practitioners and services: these have used research findings in         conducting their work.
On the environment: planning decisions have been informed; the         management of environmental risks and hazards have been changed.
In order to facilitate practical use of their research, the group       developed fast computational methods to enable large numbers of simulated       epidemics to be run in order to compare and screen different `what-if'       control scenarios, from which to select effective strategies and reject       those with high risk.
The methods and code were assembled into a more       broadly applicable epidemiological tool-box for invading pathogens in       crop, forest and natural environments at regional and country-wide scales,       and which is now freely available to policy makers and relevant others7.
Sudden oak death     Despite its name, sudden oak death has a wide host range, infecting more       than 100 economically and ecologically important woody hosts.
It is       currently invading woodlands and heathlands in the UK, and putting at risk       woodlands in California.
Impacts on public policy     In Aug 2008, Gilligan's group was approached by the Forestry Commission       and Defra to introduce an objective means of comparing different scenarios       of disease spread (see Defra grants, section 3).
From 2009, UK national       strategies and practical sampling and control regimes for sudden oak death       have been explicitly based on the resultant models8,9.
Throughout England and Wales, they are used to inform, adjust and       implement sampling and control policies (Involving 55,000 km of targeted       aerial survey as part of a &#163;25M `eradication and control' management       scheme) that hitherto had been ad hoc.
The models have also been used (since 2009) in collaboration with the US       Department of Agriculture (USDA) to investigate and screen strategies for       management of sudden oak death in California, which is causing major       losses in vegetation in the State.
The models have demonstrated the value       of early detection and control, and been used to determine which regions       of the state are likely to be at most risk.
They have also been used to       demonstrate that creating barriers by removing large areas of vegetation       is unlikely to work.
More widely, the models have been used inform US       policy advisers and policy makers about the risks of spread of sudden oak       death in Eastern states of the US and of citrus diseases in Florida and       California10.
Impacts on practitioners and services, impacts on the environment     As control involves felling trees and removal of shrubs around infected       sites, the models are used by practitioners to gauge the probable       epidemiological and economic effectiveness of different culling distances       and frequency of revisit.
They also guide aerial and ground surveys for       the disease, by generating `hazard maps' identifying where disease would       have most impact.
Chalara fraxinia &#8212; ash dieback     Following the discovery of Chalara fraxinia, a fungal pathogen       that causes dieback of ashtrees, in the UK for the first time in 2012, and       based on the group's prior expertise, the Government in consultation with       the Government Chief Scientific Adviser (GCSA) commissioned them (through       Defra) to model the potential spread in the UK11.
The rapid       Government response was based on the commercial and leisure values of ash       in the UK; it is one of the most valuable native hardwoods (comprising       ~15% of the standing UK hardwood stock) and one of the most common trees       in urban settings.
Impacts on public policy     The group adapted and enhanced the epidemiological toolbox to develop a       model to predict the likely modes of introduction of Chalara and future       spread within the UK.
The results were submitted to Defra and to the       GCSA's Expert Committee12 with a final research report which       was submitted to Defra with a final report in March 201213.
Defra's subsequent Chalara Management Plan was published March 201314,       and is extensively based on the Cambridge model (which is cited       throughout).
For example:            `Modelling the impact of Chalara' (p.13) `This priority map         [map 3, combining two maps from the Cambridge model] is already being           used to focus the efforts of Defra and Forestry Commission inspectors           who are tracing deliveries of young ash trees over recent years and           checking for signs of infection.
Details of how the modelling           has been used to inform other management decisions are set out           throughout the plan.'
The group's work is therefore the foundation for Government decision       making in terms of how to manage and where to manage the disease.
The UK Devolved Administrations have developed their own responses to       Chalara, also based on the Cambridge model.
The Chalara Management Plan       for Wales15 (March 2013) states that `the University of         Cambridge modelling work tells us that the effect of slowing the spread         of the disease will be relatively short-lived.
This means that we should         not rush to take actions ... these actions would be costly, potentially         have adverse consequences for the environment, and are unlikely to have         widespread support of landowners and woodland managers, in the light of         the limited effects on disease predicted by the Cambridge model.'
In       Ireland, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (NI) and the       Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Ireland) jointly produced       an All Ireland control strategy for Chalara16 (July 2013),       which used the Cambridge model to predict the likelihood of possible       airborne incursion of Chalara spores into Ireland, and to prioritise the       management strategy for the disease on the island.
The model is also being       used to inform control strategies in Scotland.
In May 2013 Defra published a policy paper entitled `Chalara in Ash       Trees: A Framework for Assessing Ecosystem Impacts and Appraising Options'17.
This highlights that the Chalara work, including a fundamental role for       modeling, provides a framework for the assessment of other potential such       diseases in the future, given the limited experience to date of taking a       scientific approach to managing the impacts of plant and tree diseases.
Impacts on practitioners and services     Across the UK and Ireland, the Forestry Commission, practitioners in       landscape and estate management, and those in other horticultural       professions are following Government guidance (based on the various       management plans, and therefore on the Cambridge model) in dealing with       suspected and confirmed cases of Chalara18.
Impacts on the environment     The Management Plan deals with both the management of ash trees as a       natural resource, and the management of Chalara as an environmental risk.
Impacts on society, culture and creativity &#8212; public debate has been           stimulated or informed by research: Professor Gilligan has       been interviewed about Chalara on BBC Newsnight, Countryfile, News 24, BBC       Radio 4 Today Programme, Material World, Farming Today, World at One, plus       local radio and several press interviews.
The `Tree Alert' and `ashtag'       apps are enabling the general public to get involved with mapping the       spread of the disease across the UK and Ireland19,20.
