     This research set out a particular approach to citizenship education       involving `active' citizenship and the facilitation of research,       reflection and learning.
Lincoln's research demonstrated effective use of       active learning (following Paulo Freire), and contributed new knowledge to       organise the context and the forms of relationship in the learning       process.
It has helped make significant changes to policy and practice on       public participation in democratic processes, enabling people to influence       decisions in their locality, with the research team creating sustained       impact through engagement in follow-on activities in association with       other academics and a wide range of stakeholders.
The highly positive results of the evaluation of the pilot project on       citizenship in communities [5.1] were recognised in the Department       of Communities and Local Government (DCLG) White Paper, Strong and         Prosperous Communities (2006, Section 2.60), and included in the       action plan, Building on Success (2007, p9).
Mendiwelso-Bendek       became Chair of the Take Part Network and an adviser to DCLG.
This       combination of policy and personal advice provided a pathway for the       creation of impact.
The main impact has come in 2008-2013, with policies being implemented       and knowledge disseminated through networks, programmes, user training and       materials.
A Principal Social Researcher at DCLG reflects that       Mendiwelso-Bendek's work (with other colleagues), `made a direct         contribution to the evidence base underpinning three government White         Papers, [...] and the implementation of the Take Part, Local Pathfinder         Programme.
The Take Part, learning for active citizens' approach played         a key role in forming elements of the Government's strategy for         empowering communities' [5.2].
The 2008 White Paper [5.3] committed funding to promote       citizenship learning.
The Take Part programme (the follow-on from ALAC)       received &#163;8.7 million of public funding from 2008-2011, involving two main       pathways: a Pathfinder programme (to apply the learning from Take Part       more widely); and the `National Support' programme (to engage       organisations beyond the Pathfinders to run Take Part activities) [5.4].
Nineteen Pathfinders were established nationally with local strategic       partnerships.
An evaluation of Take Part by the Community Development       Foundation [5.5] found that, `The programme had an extensive         reach... 6,569 people benefited from the pathfinders' work in 2009/10,         11,616 people benefited from the pathfinders' work in 2010/11, 967         learning opportunities were created by `Train the Take Part trainers'         activities across the duration of the programme...
Beneficiaries         increased their civic and civil activity and became more effective in         their involvement' (p30).
An evaluation of the Train the Trainers       programme by the Worker Educational Association (WEA) [5.6]       identified that 1,083 people, a significant number coming from       `disadvantaged postcode areas', participated in 63 courses.
The results       included improved knowledge and awareness of political processes and       greater confidence to lead in communities and partnership working (p3-4).
Researchers at Lincoln also created local impact by leading a Pathfinder       programme, in partnership with local authorities and a range of       communities and voluntary organisations, and extended their local reach       through a Regional Champions programme, `Take Part in the East Midlands',       in partnership with WEA and supporting 5 district councils [5.7],       and a Lincoln Citizenship Network of some 50 organizations (churches,       colleges, local authorities, voluntary sector groups), working with a       range of beneficiaries, including refugees, asylum seekers and faith       communities.
The project with Sports Volunteers was recognised with an       Inspire Award as part of the Olympics' Legacy, and there have been a wide       range of follow-on activities.
Peter Bradley, Director of Speaker's Corner       Trust, has said that Lincoln's Take Part [was] `very important to the         development and subsequent success of a permanent Lincoln Speaker's         Corner'.
In addition, an ESRC Capacity Building Cluster (Section 3) led to       the formation of University and Community Partnerships, undertaking new       research, which has already influenced the refinement of Take Part       programmes, in particular developing `research mindedness' in the Third       Sector, to strengthen the independent role of civil society through       reflective active learning and development.
A revised version of the ALAC       learning framework was published in 2011 [5.8] and outputs from       the action research have been published (e.g.
[3.6]).
The `active' approach to community development is becoming embedded, for       instance, being recognised nationally by the Community Development       Foundation (www.cdf.org.uk/content/research/previous-research/take-part),       the Workers Educational Association, and the National Institute of Adult       Continuing Education (NIACE) [5.10], whose evidential letter       points out that the `Take Part programme and the `Taking Part?'
research cluster offered a chance to NIACE to continue to improve and         refine its approaches to community learning for active citizenship'.
Mendiwelso-Bendek has disseminated the University and Community       Partnerships approach through the Andr&#233;s Bello Convention in South       America.
She has supported a programme engaging with community-based       research in the University of Concepcion (Chile) and the University of       Ibague (Colombia) where she provided a course to academics at Ibague       International Summer School 2013 [5.9].
The substantial impact of this research on the organisation and practice       of citizenship learning lies in its `conceptual robustness and its         direct applicability to local efforts' [5.2], and Lincoln's       strategy of maintaining a link with the programme from research to       practice.
As one client has said, the `...work is a good example of         the direct benefits realised by linking academic research and expertise         specifically to a policy as it moves from design, through to         implementation' [5.2].
