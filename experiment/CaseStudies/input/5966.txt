     Dr Potter's work has been a key influence in changing attitudes of both       professional performers and the listening public in respect of the       performance and reception of `early' music.
As he points out in his       chapter `Beyond the Mainstream' in A History of Singing (2012), p.       231, `during the 1990s the concept of authenticity gave way to the idea of       performances being "historically informed".... and the looser ideology       made it easier for performers to be creative.'
Potter himself was at the       forefront of this new approach, and epitomised the integration of       historical discovery and innovative performance.
While his books and       articles brought his ideas to an academic and pedagogic audience       throughout the world, with Vocal Authority appearing on library       shelves and university reading lists in several countries, his recordings       and live performances with Red Byrd and The Hilliard Ensemble turned his       research into practice, and disseminated it to audiences both within and       far beyond academia.
Through his work with the Hilliard Ensemble he won the respect of Manfred       Eicher, the autocratic founder and director of ECM records, whose       reputation is second to none in the realm of Jazz recordings, and whose       `New' series began to forge connections with classical music, and in       particular with early music and experimental new music.
Eicher's       recognition of Potter's imaginative ideas concerning the performance of       early music led him to propose the combination of early music and jazz       instrumentalists as an accompaniment for Dowland songs.
The musicians       assembled had not played together before, and in the case of Stubbs and       Surman had not previously crossed the jazz/classical divide.
The Dowland       Project is in this sense both research and impact: the professional       producer (Eicher) and musicians (Stubbs, Surman, Guy and Homburger) were       led to an original forum for creative experiment through the research       ideas of Dr Potter.
The impact of the CDs is demonstrated by:            Reviews in a variety of music publications, internationally, both         classical and jazz based.
In Darkness let me Dwell is a rarity: a           crossover project that is both defensible and listenable...Mr. Potter           and company have added new instruments to old in readings balanced           between the orthodox and the radical... New York Times (full list         of reviews available).
Commercial success evidenced by significant awards e.g.
In           Darkness let me Dwell: Sunday Times Record of the Year         2001; No 5 in the New York Times list of best records of the         year; cited in Manfred Eicher's Grammy nomination; Audio         (Germany) Classic CD of the Month.
Public broadcast and continuing live performances at international         festivals including Bremen, New York, Munich, Radovljica.
All live         performances have taken place in public rather than institutional         venues, and at major musical centres and festivals (including a         broadcast on Czech television).

Manfred Eicher's support for a second, third and fourth Dowland         Project CD on ECM following the initial Dowland disc (Care Charming           Sleep: 2002, Romaria: 2008, Night Sessions: 2013)         demonstrates that the project is both commercially and artistically         successful in the eyes of ECM.
Potter's emphasis on `freeing the music of its historical context'         (Potter: notes for Romaria 2008), has influenced the         performances of Barry Guy and Maya Homburger, whose recitals now         regularly combine baroque and contemporary performance with         improvisation (e.g.
CD Dakryon: Maya Recordings 2005 DDD         MCD0501).
Potter's series of interpretations of Dowland were an         important build up to the 450th anniversary of Dowland's         birth in 2013.
Potter's work had a direct influence on the composer Ambrose Field,         who created his large-scale composition Being Dufay around         fragments of chansons by Dufay (1397-1474) sung by John Potter.
Although         Potter sings the vocal fragments, the piece was not a collaborative         composition.
It appeared in 2009 as a single artist CD by Ambrose Field         on the ECM label.
Subsequently, the piece has been toured, with         projected images by the artist Mick Lynch, and performed at major music         festivals.
In the live event, John Potter contributes vocal         improvisation on the Dufay fragments, in the manner of the Dowland         Project improvisations.
The composition (CD) and live performances are         claimed as demonstrating further impact arising from the Dowland         Project.
