     Reminiscence theatre has two primary goals: to improve the mental and       physical well-being of senior citizens, especially those with dementia,       and to promote intergenerational dialogue.
ARTA achieved these through:            Activating the Reminiscence Theatre Archive, developing a new model         and performing in sheltered housing units and to the general public       Enhancing relationships between the elderly people themselves, and         with their wardens and carers, and with the young volunteers       Creating a sustainable and active future for the Archive       Sharing methodology and influencing practice.
1.
Activating the Reminiscence Theatre Archive     The project has created a new model of reminiscence theatre by proving       that archive material can be used instead of live interviews.
It has       learned what the strengths and weaknesses of this approach are and found       creative ways to deal with problems.
After testing out the material with       practitioners and the general public, the company toured the work to 5       sheltered housing units in Woolwich and Greenwich (2012/13), performing       and engaging in reminiscence sessions with the elderly audience.
Extracts       from the shows are available at         http://reminiscencetheatrearchive.org.uk/category_idtxt__topics.aspx     2.
Enhancing relationships     Both the young people and the elderly spectators described the positive       impact of intergenerational conversation on their knowledge of the past       and understanding of present social situations; residential wardens learnt       more about their residents, enabling enhanced person-centred care; and the       elderly residents were able to share fresh memories in a structured and       thoughtful environment.
The sessions provided valuable reassurance to       elderly residents that the social realities of their generation are not       forgotten.
The centrality of the elderly residents' experience also       reenergises their relationships with fellow residents, family carers and       wardens.

Sustaining the archive     ARTA is one of the very few large-scale reminiscence theatre projects in       the country, and the only active one in the London area.
It is a sustained       project which has successfully engaged 100 marginalised older people, 13       young volunteers and over 200 others including academics and       practitioners, since it started formally in 2012.
A `Friends of the       Archive' programme is engaging the public in the archive, and in the       process of preserving it by training local and international volunteers in       archiving practices such as transcription and digitising.

Sharing methodology and influencing practice     Through research dissemination, training programmes and international       networks, the value of the archive and the methodologies it documents have       had an impact on the practice of reminiscence theatre, care of elderly       sheltered housing residents and dementia care programmes.
Archive Symposium (2012) brought together local community         members who have connections to the archive material either as         interviewees or family members; theatre practitioners, archivists and         oral historians; academics from 10 UK Universities; and representatives         from international reminiscence organisations.
The event created space         for exchange between those with first-hand knowledge of the material and         methods, those with an academic interest in the material and those         looking to develop existing care of the elderly.
International training events (2012/13) are influencing         current practice in reminiscence and dementia care.
A new training         course and apprenticeship scheme in Reminiscence Arts in Dementia Care         has been developed for the European Reminiscence Network, hosted at the         University Drama programme's dedicated facilities (October 2012).
12         community arts practitioners were enabled to devise new methods for         engaging dementia sufferers and their carers in arts activities, and         spent 6 weeks working with staff and elderly people with dementia.
This         pilot scheme is part of a 10-country partnership supported by the         European Commission's Lifelong Learning programme (Grundtvig Adult         Learning) with a view to extending and sharing the European Reminiscence         Network's experience of running a two-year project, "Remembering         Together: Reminiscence Training".
Following the pilot's success, Lilley         and Schweitzer hosted a second training event (Jan 2013) for 15 dementia         care workers from across Europe.
Invitations to share practice through conferences, including         Lilley at TaPRA (Sept 2012) and Prague's European Reminiscence Network         meeting (Nov 2012).
The Reminiscence Theatre Archive Company was invited         to perform at events hosted by the Memories of War Archive (Sept and Dec         2012) and at `Performing the Collection: action and reaction in         taxonomic space', National Maritime Museum and Stephen Lawrence Gallery,         University of Greenwich (Nov 2012).
The open           access ARTA website is key to dissemination.
Representative         archive materials are available online, organised in a way that reflects         the findings of Lilley and Derbyshire, with suggestions         for how to use them effectively and opportunities for user feedback.
The         resource's multi-disciplinary focus on oral history, reminiscence         theatre methodology and dementia care work has no equivalent and         provides a much needed resource that enhances the study of applied         drama, arts and health and community theatre practice.
