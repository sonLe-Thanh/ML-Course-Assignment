     A key impact of Lincoln's research is changes to three different clinical       practice guidelines with       beneficiaries including clinicians, clinical psychologists, general       practitioners, occupational       therapists, stroke patients and their families.
Impact on Royal College of Physicians Guidelines and identification of         evidence gap     Based upon Lincoln's ongoing work with the Royal College of Physicians,       her research on intensity       of time spent on rehabilitation, measurement of sensory problems and       interventions for memory,       attention and spatial awareness following stroke was featured in the 2012       RCP National Clinical       Guidelines for strokea.
The assessment methods developed as       part of the research (sensory test,       SADQ and SDSA) are recommended within the guidelines.
For example: `All         patients should be         assessed for alteration in sensation.
If indicated, a more formal         assessment of sensory loss should         be undertaken (eg using the Nottingham Sensory Assessment, Erasmus         medical centre version)'a.
Impact of better identification of psychological problems     Lincoln's research first highlighted the need for better identification       and assessment of       psychological problems after stroke and how these relate to cognitive       dysfunction5,7.
This gap in       treatment contributed to the development of the NHS Improvement `Psychological         Care After         Stroke' reportb.
This is a guide for clinical       practitioners to support the establishment and       development of services for psychological care of people with cognitive       and mood disorders       following stroke.
In the report, and based upon her work, Lincoln outlines       a treatment and referral       pathway for stroke patients with cognitive dysfunction and mood disorders,       utilising the role of       occupational therapists and with better access to clinical psychologists.
Lincoln worked with stroke       patients to develop these strategies to ensure that changes put in place       were applicable within a       clinical setting.
A stroke patient from Dorset, quoted in the Improvement       Plan, describes the impact       of these changes:     `I couldn't understand why things were so much harder...
I couldn't         follow things.
I worked before         my stroke and was...am... an intelligent man, but didn't feel that way         anymore.
The tests were         interesting for me... some bits were so easy, other bits just made me         unravel... things I knew I         should be able to do.
It really helped me and my wife that the girls         explained why this was         happening... that it was the stroke, not me.
I guess I felt it gave me         some control to understand it...         now I just hope there will be some improvement'b.
NCGC Stroke Rehabilitation Guideline Change     Lincoln's work also contributed to the 2011 Stroke Rehabilitation       Guidelines produced by the       National Clinical Guideline Centre (NCGC)c. NCGC produce       evidence-based clinical practice       guidelines on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Clinical       Excellence (NICE), with the aim       of improving the quality of NHS patient care in England and Wales.
The       guidelines cite Lincoln and       colleagues' research on spatial neglect as supporting evidence for their       recommendations on       assessment and interventions and the provision of occupational therapy       following stroke.
Finally, the group's influence on clinical guidelines and practice in       stroke rehabilitation can also be       seen internationally in the Australian National Stroke Foundation's       Clinical Guidelines for Stroke       Management 2010d, particularly in relation to recommendations       for the assessment and treatment       of those with cognitive and attention deficits, spatial neglect3,       mood disturbance5 and driving.
Development of Stroke Assessments and International Reach     The SADQ has also generated clinical service change.
Clinicians in the UK       now use the SADQ       routinely for stroke patients and it is being used internationally with       translations in French, Dutch,       Greek, Italian, Japanese and Chinesee.
A key feature of Lincoln's work on assessment development also included       the SDSA, to assess       fitness to drive following a stroke.
This has had an impact on clinical       services and Australian, North       American, European and Hebrew versions of the tests have been developede.
Researchers in       China and Japan are currently conducting translation and validation       studies to extend the Asian       market for this assessment.
For the Japanese arm, the Manager of the       Department of       Occupational Therapy in Inobe Hospital reported in 2013 that: the       translation of SDSA to Japanese       has been completed with the support of KICTEC Co, one of the largest road       sign construction       companies in Japanf.
A multi-centre trial to establish the SDSA       in hospitals and universities across       Japan is underway and data are due to be collected from 100 stroke       patients who have undergone       SDSA evaluationf.
Finally, the SDSA has played a role in informing overseas guidelines on       driving safety following       stroke in the form of Expert Panel Recommendations presented to the       Federal Motor Carrier       Safety Administration in the USAg.
Impact on engagement of the stroke practice community     Lincoln's research has achieved significant reach across the clinical       practice community working       directly with stroke patients through the setup of the Organisation for       Psychologists Researching In       Stroke group (OPSYRIS) in 2002.
The OPSYRIS is the national body of       researchers and clinicians       in stroke in the UK (for psychologists based primarily in practice http://wfnr.co.uk/en/special-interest-groups/organisation-for-psychological-research-into-stroke-opsyris/)       and a sub-group of       the World Federation for Neurorehabilitation.
Alongside annual meetings       across the UK, through       this network Lincoln developed a wide range of collaborative projects with       practising clinicians,       including the mood assessment project which led to direct impacts on       clinical practice.
The Chair of       OPSYRIS Dr Bowen describes Lincoln's role in the growth of this group as       fundamental:     `Nadina Lincoln ensured the continuity and growth of the         group...during her chairmanship         OPSYRIS grew from a small group of psychologists to a current         multidisciplinary membership of         143, and attendance at annual meetings is usually about 50 people.
Through Nadina Lincoln's         strong leadership and international reputation OPSYRIS has become a         special interest group of         the World Federation for NeuroRehabilitation'h
