     Impact within the assessment period builds on a longer history of       engagement with science teachers, which began with the establishment of       the SCIcentre, funded by the Society for Chemical Industries, in 1996.
The       Centre produced a range of print and video materials, underpinned by       research findings, which focussed on improving subject knowledge and       teaching practice, promoting positive images of scientists and their work       in industry, and supporting the use of IT in science teaching.
Materials       were distributed to UK ITE providers, and were available for sale       nationally and internationally, the most substantial numbers being bought       in USA, Australia, New Zealand, Malta and Ireland.
Video materials were       made available on YouTube in 2010 (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz2c5OJ5Yx0).
The research programme led by Jarvis established the reputation of       Leicester School of Education in the field of science education, and was a       significant factor in the award to the School of the competitive contract       to establish the Science Learning Centre East Midlands (SLCEM) in 2004.
As       part of the Government-funded national network of 10 Science Learning       Centres, SLCEM is the major provider of science CPD in the region and has       a close relationship with the School of Education.
This enables research       carried out in the School to inform the content and direction of the       science CPD SLCEM provides.
In return, SLCEM provides a testing and       validation environment for the School's cutting-edge research.
Impact and       evaluation studies from the SLCEM are shared with the national network of       Science Learning Centres in order to inform future development.
Since       being awarded the initial contract in 2004 and the second in 2008 with       further extensions in 2011 and 2012, SLCEM has provided CPD for over       10,000 teachers (7300 teachers from 2008 to present, A),       technicians and teaching assistants and the impact during this period in       the region has been considerable.
In the period since 2008:            75% of participants reported improvement in their knowledge and skills       81% reported changes in their practice       75% reported evidence of wider impact on the school       67% demonstrated impact on pupils in terms of learning, motivation and         enjoyment       71% of participants indicated that the greatest impact had been on the         sharing of knowledge with colleagues       79% of participants reported an impact on their skills in teaching in         terms of science knowledge and understanding.
Evaluation studies also indicate that 99% of teachers attending would       recommend SLCEM CPD courses to others and 97% rated these as being very       good or good (A).
In addition to this considerable influence within the UK context, the       impact of development of science CPD built on and informed by Jarvis'       research has spread in Europe through two major EU funded research and       professional development networks.
Pollen Seed Cities for Europe (2006-09)       involved 12 countries, in each of which a `Seed City' was identified to       develop inquiry-based science in primary schools.
The team at Leicester       worked with 95 teachers and 2500 pupils in 27 schools, and took the lead       in developing innovative cross-curricular approaches to science teaching       which were disseminated across the project.
Additionally, at the       conclusion of the project, University of Leicester was commissioned to       evaluate the effects in all 12 countries, using the instruments developed       in the AstraZeneca project.
Responses from 420 teachers indicated the       positive impact: `After two years, the confidence of teachers teaching         science had improved significantly and that attitudes to specific Pollen         objectives have shown significant improvements' (C).
The particular success of the Pollen project was identified in the EU       commissioned Rocard Report (B): The specificity of Pollen ...         [is to] promote a change in the pedagogical approach used to teach         science.
Additionally these initiatives provide opportunities for the         establishment of a European network of science education teachers, which         appears to be a key factor in promoting excellence.
The success of Pollen's impact on teachers' confidence and competence in       teaching science formed the basis for the development of a larger       cross-European network, through the Fibonacci project (2010-2013; D),       which had the aim of disseminating Inquiry-Based Science &amp; Mathematics       Education in Europe.
The project involved over 30 partners across 23       countries involving at least 6000 teachers and 30000 pupils, and 500       teacher educators.
Leicester was one of the major partners, considered to       have special expertise in science CPD, and also led a cross-curricular       thematic group, involving teams from seven countries.
The project evaluation (E) reported that: ` .. there has been a         clear impact on the schools, the teachers and the pupils as shown by the         analysis of the statistical data gathered.
Teachers state that their         motivation and confidence in teaching IBSME has been greatly enhanced by         the CPD organized by Fibonacci.
When analysing the difference between         the average confidence scores of all the teachers in the pre-and post-         questionnaires there is a significant positive difference on two thirds         of the items surveyed especially when aspects of inquiry-based teaching         are concerned.'
