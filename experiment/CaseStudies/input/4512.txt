     The Centre promotes dialogue, debate and creative activity through new       innovative work and ideas, exhibitions, curation and publications.
Work       reaches a wide audience and plays a role in developing a greater       recognition and understanding of sound and sound arts, opening up new       contexts for public involvement and appreciation.
Beneficiaries include       museums and galleries, the creative community and the general public.
The       significance and reach of impact is demonstrated through media coverage,       collaborations with prestigious institutions, high profile exhibitions,       performances and commissions, support from funding bodies, and awards.
Toop joined UAL shortly after his curation of Sonic Boom (2000),       Hayward Gallery, the first major international exhibition of Sonic Art       held in the UK.
His publications Ocean of Sound (1995), Exotica       (1999), Haunted Weather (2004) and Sinister Resonance       (2010), two of which were written whilst employed by UAL, are, according       to The Guardian, `visionary tracts', who also named Toop as part       of a triumvirate (alongside Jon Savage and Paul Morley) of the `most         influential (defined in this context as "creative people might actually         have done things differently because of them") British music writers of         the last three or four decades.'
Sinister Resonance was one of The       Independent's Books of the Year, who claim the publication is Toop's `most         illuminating yet'.
Toop's contribution to BBC Radio 4's The         Sound of Fear (2011) drew on insights from Sinister Resonance       and the publication's theme of `hearing' paintings was developed by Toop       as part of Sounds of the Gallery (2009), an audio guide sound       installation at the National Gallery, London.
Voegelin's Listening To         Noise And Silence was described in The Wire as `a challenging         treatise on the art of listening', with additional reviews of the       publication including Art Monthly and Avant Music News.
Her work in this       area has resulted in appearances on BBC Radio 4 (2010), at The Wire         Salon (2010), and as part of Boxed Tunes at the ICA (2011).
Voegelin was also was an adviser to the Supersonix Conference and       Festival, London (2012).
Wynne's work on language endangerment resulted in Anspayaxw (2010)       an installation at The Museum of Anthropology, Vancouver.
It focused on       members of the Gitxsan community and their language, Gitxsanimaax, and was       shown as part of Border Zones: New Art Across Cultures, which       received 115,831 visitors.
The True Language (a piece made with       materials from this project) was commissioned for broadcast on BBC Radio 4       (2012).
The 2009 installation Transplant (Wynne) was developed       during an Arts Council funded residency at Harefield Hospital and received       press coverage including a four-star review in The Guardian.
An additional       outcome of the residency, Hearts, Lungs and Minds (2008),       commissioned by BBC Radio 3, received the Bronze Award at the Third Coast       International Audio Festival.
Lane's audio compilation Playing With         Words (2010) was released by German label Gruenrekorder, and was       called `clear and compelling' by the Canadian journal MusicWorks       (2011).
Tweed (Lane) from Playing with Words, was included       in Sound Matters: Exploring Sound through Forms, a Crafts Council       exhibition (2013).
Interest in this field is evidenced by Speaking         Out: the spoken word in artistic practice (2010), a public symposium       held at Tate Modern in collaboration with CRiSAP.
Events such as this are       a key aspect of the Centre's engagement activities and include In the         Field: International Symposium for Field Recording (2013) with the       British Library, and Her Noise: Feminism and the Sonic (2012) with       Tate Modern and Electra.
The British Library's Curator, Natural Sounds,       describes CRiSAP as `leading the way in championing a wider awareness         and interest in sound and sound arts.'
Since 2008 Cusack's Favourite Sounds project has resulted in Favourite         Sounds: Prague; Favourite Sounds: Southend on Sea, later       exhibited at the Southbank Festival of Britain 60th Anniversary         Celebrations; Favourite Sounds: Birmingham (2010)       commissioned by Midland Arts Centre; and Berlin Favourite Sounds       (2012/13) part of Berlin Sonic Places initiated by Cusack during       his residency for the DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program.
Cusack's project Sounds         from Dangerous Places developed in parallel with Favourite         Sounds, examines sound in places of major environmental damage.
The       resulting double CD and publication, presented findings and recordings       from fieldwork in locations including the Caspian oil fields, Azerbaijan,       and the Chernobyl exclusion zone, and was one of The Wire's top 50       releases of 2012.
Positive Soundscapes culminated in the Sound         Escapes exhibition (2009) at SPACE Gallery, London.
Co-curated by       Carlyle, it included a work by Cusack, Soundscapes Sequencer, the       main artistic commission from the research project itself.
The show was       Critics' Choice in Time Out and reviewed in Frieze.
An Arts Council report       on collaborations between arts institutions and HE Towards Ecologies         of Learning: Enhancing Relations between Arts and Academic (2010)       highlighted Sound Escapes as a `good example' of effective       crossover.
The compilation album Autumn Leaves (2008), part       of the `bibliographic review' of the project, was awarded the Qwartz Prize       for Electronic Music (compilation category).
The installation         Airpressure (2011), created by Carlyle in collaboration with Dr       Rupert Cox (University of Manchester) and Professor Kozo Hiramatsu (Kyoto       University), focused on the environment of a farming family whose land is       surrounded by Narita International Airport in Japan.
Supported by over       &#163;50,000 from the Wellcome Trust, it was described as `spectacularly         immersive' by The Guardian.
Forty-one thousand people visited Airpressure       and a film version Kiatsu was jury-selected for exhibition at       Albuquerque Museum, part of the International Symposium on Electronic Art       (2012).
Toop's Unknown Devices, shortlisted for the Design Innovation of       the Year for The Guardian Innovation Awards (2008), has performed at The       Royal Festival Hall (2008) in collaboration with London Sinfonietta and       The Royal College of Music, and at Tate Britain (2010), Tate Modern       (2010), and The Barbican (2013).
FLAT TIME/sounding was originally       performed at the Whitechapel Gallery in 2010, commission on behalf of the       John Latham archive and with financial support from the PRS for Music       Foundation.
It has since been performed internationally including at the Just         Listen Festival, Cork (2011); and the ICMC Festival, Perth (2013).
Star-shaped         Biscuit (2012) supported by Toop's fellowship from Aldeburgh Music       and the Jerwood Charitable Foundation, premiered as a Faster Than         Sound production at Aldeburgh Music (2012).
The Guardian wrote of       the work: `There are fascinating ideas [...] and much to ponder for         anyone seeking to relocate opera to the 21st century.'
Installation for 300 speakers, Pianola and vacuum cleaner became       the first work of sound art in the Saatchi collection and the centrepiece       of Newspeak: British Art Now, the second most visited London       exhibition 2010, attracting 557,192 visitors.
Press coverage was       extensive, and critic Brian Sewell commented that the installation stood       out `as a real work of art' and referred to the way `these         grey, brown and black bits and pieces of our technological lives combine         in an odd grace'.
Wynne won the 2010 British Composer Award for       Sonic Art for this work.
Wynne's exploration of site- and       situation-specific sound practice can be seen in his sound design for the       theatre production, Racine's Andromache (2011), with director       Graham McLaren for the Luminato Festival of the Arts in Toronto.
For this Wynne was nominated for a Dora Award for Outstanding Sound       Design/Composition by the Toronto Alliance for the Performing Arts       alongside the National Theatre's War Horse.
