Commercial     The project's multiple innovations have impacted the commercial interests       of publishing       houses Kiepenheuer &amp; Witsch (K&amp;W) and Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag       (DTV) in significant       ways.
K&amp;W is a major literary publisher of works by prominent       contemporary German and       international writers, such as Saul Bellow, V.S.
Naipaul and Gabriel       Garcia Marquez with a       backlist of 568 authors.
DTV exploits its paperback rights.
The biggest       ever publishing project       in K&amp;W's history, the edition was designated as being of national       significance by the then       Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schr&#246;der at the launch ceremony in 2002.
With       three volumes       released over a decade at the annual high-profile international Frankfurt       Book Fair, it       generated a fresh wave of prestige, publicity, marketing and sales       opportunities, not least       owing to the definitive re-editing of existing writings as well as the       presentation of unpublished       texts for the very first time which were quickly translated and sold under       new copyright around       the world.
`The way it was produced has been new in German publishing because we         have generated a         complete digital edition [...] and by this we are able to have a much         easier printing process         and we are also able to license other editions which can use our text         basis.
[...] It is having a         tremendous [commercial] effect because by this means we have a reliable         text on which we         can generate different editions, for instance new hardcover editions of         single novels or         editions of collected stories.
We can also publish audio books, and         together with our partner,         Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag [...] new paperback editions, and an         electronic version.
So         the publishing house is very indebted to the editors because [...] we         are able to prolong the         copyright for the works of Heinrich B&#246;ll, and the public will have         access to editions during the         next decades'[A]     ii.
Digital Humanities     Impact was generated for the company Pagina Ltd via its close       collaboration on the project.
The software that was developed has `set the benchmarks for the       application of digital       humanities technologies to large-scale critical editions'.
A particularly       important technical       innovation came in specific response to the team's editorial needs and has       been subsequently       disseminated as good practice in trade publications.
The CEO acknowledges       the further       importance of the Edition to Pagina in establishing a new commercial       department for `Digital       Humanities' which has been central to his company's development as a       thriving enterprise,       helping it to win new business.
It now occupies a niche as supplier to       other leading publishing       houses on projects such as the Complete Thomas Mann Edition for S Fischer       Verlag.
Pagina       acknowledges the Edition as part of a causal development which underpinned       the company's       reputation as a market-leader, culminating in it being one of the       co-founders, in 2012, of the       joint professional organisation `Digital Humanities Deutschland'.

Culture, Heritage/Tourism     The celebration of B&#246;ll as a `Cologne author' is tied directly into the       Edition and has generated       impact for municipal cultural and heritage institutions.
Examples are the       `Literature in Cologne'       (LiK) and Heinrich B&#246;ll archives.
Based in its Central Library with open       access to the general       public, LiK's mission is to raise and maintain the profile of the history       of Cologne literary life       since the Second World War so that it becomes part `of the public       consciousness'.
In       corroborating interviews, the Director confirmed that the Edition was       `enormously important'       and that `its significance is incredibly high': it is an invaluable source       to deal with public       interest and enquiries and it obviates the need to make originals of texts       available which might       otherwise suffer damage.
Moreover the wealth of new materials in the       apparatus has been       mined for regular public events and exhibitions associated with B&#246;ll's       life and work       (e.g.Output 1 on 30.11.2012).
Exhibitions of other, broader       interest are given a B&#246;ll-theme       which deliberately capitalises on his high name-recognition to fulfil the       Director's vision of       making `a living archive' [C].
The entire second storey of the       Central Library has been restyled       as an interactive `Literary World' and its centrepiece is a recreation of       B&#246;ll's original       study/library.
Impact has been generated for local tourism in Cologne.
The Edition's       public sponsors as well       as public-service broadcaster WDR are partners in the `B&#246;ll and Cologne'       initiative.
The city       has "A Walking Tour of the City in the Footsteps of Heinrich B&#246;ll" which       has been run for the       past five years and uses the writer's life and works as a window on the       city's history.
Output 1       features on the website, particularly the section entitled "Cologne in       B&#246;ll", as it is the novel       which most evokes and references this history in the Twentieth Century [D].
The destruction of the building of the Historical Archives of the City of       Cologne in March 2009       and the loss of the original manuscripts and other documents means that       the finished volumes       now have a curatorial value to posterity immeasurably greater than       originally envisaged by the       editors.
The Federal Minister for Culture and Media declared the Edition       `part of the national       literary heritage of Germany as a nation of culture'.
[E]     iv.
Media/Public Sphere     The Edition has been extensively reported and discussed in the German and       international       media (substantial newspaper clippings are available), keeping the writer       in the book-buying       public's consciousness, and raising the profiles of the stakeholders and       sponsors.
A touring       exhibition, a retrospective on B&#246;ll's life and works, supported by the       Goethe Institut and the       German Information Centre of the European Parliament, draws on many of the       new archival       discoveries (e.g.
the colour plans for novels as described in Output 2,       since published       separately, and the wartime correspondence detailed in Output 5).
The Edition features       prominently in the activities, website and annual reports of the       independent political and       cultural Heinrich-B&#246;ll-Foundation, which has offices in thirty countries       around the world.
[F]       Finally, it has stimulated public debate, particularly concerning the       social function of literature,       and the responsibility of the writer as public intellectual among a       younger generation of       writers, for example [G], [H].
