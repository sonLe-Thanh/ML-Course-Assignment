     Context       From the mid 1990s into the 2000s EWERC's research reports and       publications arising out of its coordination of the EC Experts Group on       Gender and Employment (EGGE) and the national and international       comparative research programme across EU member states and EFTA countries       that EWERC designed and executed were very influential in developing a       gender dimension to European employment policy particularly with respect       to gender mainstreaming and gender pay policy.
Pathways to impact       In all funded research projects Professors Grimshaw and Rubery enjoyed       strong collaborations with personnel from the funding partners at the       International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the EC.
All projects were       accompanied by reports, supplementary policy briefings and various forms       of individual presentations, such as keynote talks at EC meetings, policy       workshops and training sessions for EC and ILO high level staff.
Reach and Significance       There are 220 million workers within the European Union who are affected       by EU employment, gender and wage policy set by the European Commission.
The ILO is a United Nations agency dealing with labour issues,       particularly international labour standards and decent work for all, and       comprises 185 UN member countries.
Impact on gender employment policy       Advances in the EC's gender mainstreaming policy draw extensively on EWERC       research.
In 2008 the Commission produced a widely used resource, the `Manual         for Gender Mainstreaming' [F], which was designed as a user-friendly       guide for policy-makers and social partners across the EU to incorporate       gender issues in employment and social policy.
References to EWERC       research are made throughout the manual.
Furthermore, the EC's recommended       resources for gender impact assessments listed on its Europa website       include two EWERC research reports.
The 2008 interim report on the 2006-10       Roadmap to Gender equality notes that the `publication of a "Manual         for gender mainstreaming of employment policies" was welcomed by the         Member States' [G].
The head of the EC's Equal Opportunities Unit       [A] from 1992-1996 has described in a published book chapter the impact of       the EWERC research in the following terms: `this... network, over the         years, produced unique comparative analysis to guide policy making at EU         and national level, contributing to the `Europeanization' of gender         employment policy' (Hubert 2011).
Similarly, the current Head of       Unit states `Their research has provided the basis for systematic         gender impact and gender mainstreaming assessments of EU and national         level employment policy' [C].
The European Community of Practice         on Gender Mainstreaming (an EU body) in its position paper [H] on       the preparation of the Structural Funds programming period 2014+ makes       reference to listed published papers 2 and 3.
Further downstream policy       impact is demonstrated by reference to EWERC research on gender indicators       by the ad hoc Working Group of Member States representatives for the EQUAL       programme set up to address effective ways of integrating the principles       of gender equality and gender mainstreaming into European Structural Funds       Operational Programmes for 2007-2013.
In 2008 Rubery joined an advisory group for the ETUC's general secretary       and in 2010 the advisory board for the linked European Trade Union       Institute to advise on European employment policy and particularly gender       aspects.
In 2013 she was asked to introduce a panel on equality at the       ETUC's mid-term conference, as corroborated in the letter by the Director       of the ETUI Research Department [D].
In 2012, she joined an EU high-level       expert group chaired by the Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs       and Inclusion to advise on the development of a social investment package       for the EU on the basis of her research on gender and social models.
And       in 2013 she was invited to join the Scientific Board of the European       Parliament Socialists and Democrats group's `Progressive Economy       Initiative.
Her work on gender mainstreaming in the EES also led to an       invitation from the ILO in 2005 to provide a report on gender       mainstreaming of the global employment agenda.
This report is referenced       in the 2009 report on Gender equality at the heart of decent work       item V1 to the International Conference of the ILO (main policymaking       body) and the 2011 ILO report to the conference on gender equality refers       to the 2007 EC report that underpinned the manual on gender mainstreaming.
The Research and Policy Coordinator of the Conditions of Work and Equality       Department at the ILO, refers to Rubery's work as a `powerful piece of         evidence in the ILO's ongoing agenda to strengthen policymakers'         awareness of gender equality issues in employment' [B].
Impact on wage policy       Policy reports and briefings issued by the International Labour       Organisation (ILO) and European Commission exert a strong influence on       European wage policy and EWERC research can claim a significant impact       since 2008.
The ILO Global Wage Report (2008) cites EWERC research       demonstrating evidence that the level of collective bargaining coverage       among women in Europe is dampened by non-standard employment contracts and       that in order for minimum wages to reduce the gender pay gap they ought to       be set at levels above pay rates found in female-dominated sectors and       occupations.
The 2010 ILO Global Wage Report [I] cites and takes       long text excerpts from a specially commissioned EWERC report by Grimshaw.
This covered the clarification of operational definitions of low-wage       employment, the collation of international data on low pay, analyses of       inter-relationships with other pay equity indicators, the identification       of reasons for women's over-representation in low-wage jobs, the       interaction between minimum wage and collective bargaining mechanisms and       policy measures to improve low pay.
As the Research and Policy Coordinator       states in his letter of support, `The fact that Damian Grimshaw's         paper was the most frequently cited paper in the Global Wage Report         (fifteen times) testifies to the critical contribution of his paper'       [B].
Grimshaw and Rubery's minimum wage research was disseminated at an       international conference, hosted by EWERC, at which the Commissioner for       DG Employment (EC) made a keynote talk.
The Deputy Head of the Unit [E] at       the EC states that this research: `has had an especially significant         impact on our understanding of the pay equity effects of minimum wage         policy in diverse industrial relations contexts' .
Further impact on       the ILO's minimum wage policy recommendations includes Grimshaw's hosting       of a symposium on minimum wage policy and pay equity at its 2011 Regulating         for Decent Work conference and an ILO commissioned technical report       on youth minimum wages by Grimshaw in 2012, which formed the basis for the       ILO's 2012 G20 Employment Brief on `Decent Pay and Minimum Wages for Young       People' [J] and was also adapted for inclusion in a high profile ILO book,       Labour Market Institutions and Inequality (forthcoming).
Research       by Rubery and Grimshaw on gender and minimum wages was also cited by and       used by ILO staff in successfully preparing a new regulation on domestic       work, as attested to by the Research and Policy Coordinator in his letter       of support [B].
Most recently, EWERC research on public sector pay was       included in the EC DG Employment flagship publication, Industrial         Relations in Europe (2012).
Impact on the International Labour Organisation       There are more than 500 references to work by Rubery and Grimshaw on the       ILO website which reflects the depth of their relationship with the       organisation.
Rubery has contributed to the annual ILO `World Employment'       reports, published commissioned Working Papers, participated in ILO policy       discussions and workshops and in a recent study of gender implications of       public sector adjustment.
Grimshaw has acted as a UK expert in six ILO       projects since 2005 covering vulnerable work, decent work, minimum wages,       recession and inequalities, public sector and social models.
He has also       produced two specially commissioned state-of-the art reports on low wage       work and decent pay for youth and has delivered workshops to ILO staff on       gender pay equity and on public sector pay.
Rubery and Grimshaw, along with other MBS colleagues, were instrumental       in developing the collaboration of the University of Manchester in the       ILO's high profile international conference called `Regulating for Decent       Work' from the second conference in 2011 onwards.
It is held in Geneva in       alternate years and Rubery sits on its steering committee.
The Research       and Policy Coordinator [B] describes it as `a high profile ILO         activity designed to maximise the impact of leading academic research on         employment policy and practice.'
For 2013, Rubery was invited by ILO       staff to provide a plenary presentation and Grimshaw hosted a symposium on       public sector pay.
It attracts strong interest from European policy-makers       and its importance in the ILO's work has been underlined by the       opening/closing of the conference by the DG of the ILO.
