     The research described above has created a new and highly effective       technique for the control and eradication of insect pests and carriers of       disease.
Professor Alphey is the world leader in non- proliferative GM       interventions and the only person so far to have designed transgenic       insects that have been approved for release in the wild.
As well as       leading to successful suppression of insect populations and demonstrating       significant advantages over conventional SIT, Alphey and Oxitec Ltd have       been instrumental in `forcing the pace' in terms of regulation of GM       insects, and Oxitec has attracted substantial investment as a result of       the potential of RIDL.
The biggest impact since 2008 has been in the control of the mosquito Aedes         aegypti, the dengue fever vector.
The World Health Organization       ranks dengue as the most important mosquito-borne viral disease.
In the       last 50 years Aedes aegypti has spread from Africa across the       world, leading to a 30-fold increase in the incidence of dengue, which now       threatens an estimated 2.5 billion people worldwide.
There are as many as       390 million new infections per year and 25,000 deaths, mostly children.
The economic consequences are grave; dengue is estimated to cost the       equivalent of 83 - 658 lost years of human life per million of the       population every year.
No vaccine or therapeutic drug treatment is       available, and the only current approach is to control the populations of       Aedes aegypti.
This is currently done mainly through the use of       insecticides; but because Aedes aegypti frequents human       habitations in urban areas this has a serious impact on human health, as       well as creating mosquitoes that are increasingly resistant to       insecticides.
SIT trials were conducted against mosquitoes in the 1970s with some       success, but these have not been pursued since, partly at least because       SIT in mosquitoes is very hard to implement.
The GM mosquito OX513A       represents a huge improvement over both SIT and conventional control by       insecticides.
Following the successful Cayman Island trials 5,6,       in 2012 Oxitec Ltd established a new project in Brazil with the University       of Sao Paulo and a local company, Moscamed.
The project had full backing       and regulatory approval from the Brazilian government, as well as strong       support from local communities.
In one and a half years the trials have       progressed to a stage equivalent to that of phase III trials in drug       testing.
Phase II trials demonstrated major success in controlling Aedes         aegypti in a densely populated suburban area, reducing the wild       mosquito population by over 85%7.
In another more isolated       area, with less immigration of mosquitoes, a 96% reduction of the mosquito       population was achieved after only six months, and maintained for a       further seven months8.
Full-scale local production of OX513A       mosquitoes is now in place and in June 2013 a project was launched in an       entire town of 50,000 people, demonstrating the confidence that the       Brazilian authorities have that this approach represents their best chance       of bringing dengue under control9.
Other advantages are that       the approach has a much lower impact than insecticide use in terms of       damage to human health and the environment, and there is also no need for       potentially dangerous facilities with strong gamma-ray sources for       irradiation.
Owing to Professor Alphey's success in designing a range of effective GM       insects in a very short period of time, there have been significant policy       changes worldwide.
Prior to the field trials of the GM pink bollworm in       2006-8, it was generally considered that release of GM insects was nowhere       near being realised, and consequently there was little or no regulatory       framework in place anywhere in the world.
Alphey's research has had a       major impact on the development of such frameworks, necessitating a       thorough consideration of the issues involved in GM insect releases.
In       2006 the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, part of the US       Department of Agriculture, initiated what became the first-ever       Environmental Impact Statement on any GM organism, triggered by Alphey's       successful GM designs for pink bollworm and fruitfly; the final version of       this statement was issued in October 200810.
This has been       followed by:            The 2009 World Health Organization consultation report on genetically         modified mosquitoes (GMM): this states that `Recent studies on RIDL Aedes           aegypti mosquitoes in Malaysia [i.e.
Alphey's work] stimulated         requests from countries for WHO guidance on GMM use'11.
A WHO         working group on international guidance for GMM was set up following         these consultations, and a draft Guidance Framework for the testing of         GMM has recently been issued12.
The approval in Brazil in 2009 of the importation and release of         OX513A by the national regulator, CTNBio, after a local review of the         regulatory process, which had not previously addressed GM insects13.
The May 2013 European Food Standards Authority guidance on the         environmental risk assessment of GM animals, which includes nearly 40         pages on insects.
The guidance refers specifically to GM insects used to         control vectors of human disease and manage agricultural pests, both of         which developments have been spearheaded by Alphey14.
Standards for the regulation of GM insects in general have thus been       drawn up, or are in the process of being drawn up, as a direct result of       Professor Alphey's work in designing and trialling specific types of GM       insect, and this is facilitating developments in the field as well as       helping to ensure quality control and proper risk assessment.
The huge       potential of RIDL to control both insect pests and vectors of disease is       reflected in the success of Oxitec Ltd, which has been a thriving company       for over a decade.
Since 2008 the company has received around &#163;13.4M in       convertible loans and equity investment, and employee numbers have grown       from 30 at the end of 2009 to 37 in mid-201315.
