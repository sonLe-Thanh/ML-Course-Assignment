     From the outset community engagement was a core element of the Dunluce       project.
The successful research facilitated the development of an       innovative parallel programme of public participation and outreach.
A       substantial portion of the excavation programme during 2009 was linked to       community participation through tours, workshops and joint excavations,       known as `The Big Dig'1, which was organised by Breen and the       Causeway Museums Service (CMS).
Twenty seven schools from across Northern       Ireland and Republic of Ireland participated in a quarter of the       excavations at Dunluce, with half of them returning in subsequent years.
Eight community development groups were also involved.
As a result of the       success of the community group involvement CMS was awarded &#163;200k NEP Peace       III funding for further heritage projects.2     Involvement in this process, both in Northern Ireland and Scotland, has       enhanced cross community knowledge and understanding, developed community       heritage research skills and initiated new community-led heritage based       projects.
Through the AHRC Connected Communities program, Breen       established a researcher network across Ulster and Western Scotland       including Queen's University, Belfast, Historic Scotland, Northern Ireland       Environment Agency, Kilmartin House Museum and a diverse range of schools       and community groups.3,4,5     An evaluation session carried out by Corrymeela Peace centre in       Ballycastle and the Causeway Museum Service after the Peace III 7a (2010)       "Cultural Connections: 1613-2013 The Legacy of Plantation" project (in       which Breen took part) highlighted the impact of the community-led       heritage projects on the community.
Some of the responses are listed       below.
"I will be going back into the community with more knowledge and a         desire for even more.
I am enthused, willing to spread my knowledge and         challenge misconceptions in the community".
"I want to go and do more, get more involved, question the facts and         stories"     Four of the groups involved during the earlier work at Dunluce and the       Cultural Connections funded research have gone on to receive `All Our       Stories' Heritage Lottery funding (~&#163;30k total) to continue heritage-led       development initiatives both in Scotland and Ireland.
Two of the primary       schools, Millstrand Integrated Primary, Portrush, NI, and Tayvallich,       Argyll, Scotland, have formally introduced heritage and heritage fieldwork       into their school curricula.
The archaeological research at Dunluce has also significantly enhanced       its economic and tourist performance.
The Castle has been a major tourist       attraction since the 19th century and remains the most visited       archaeological site in Northern Ireland.
The summer excavations carried       out by Dr. Colin Breen at Dunluce began in 2008 and were completed in       2010; they resulted in an increase in the number of annual summer visitors       to the site by 4986 at the excavation peak in 2009.
The increase in visitor numbers during the research and excavation       programme at Dunluce coupled with recognition of the unique significance       and potential of Dunluce resulting from the research programme led to the       NITB, under the Tourist Development Scheme 2010-2011, and the NIEA       investing &#163;104k each in interpretation and visitor facilities at the site6.
These facilities were informed and supported by the information gathered       throughout the research project.
Dr Breen was the lead historical advisor       for the exhibit and fronts a 15 minute onsite video as part of it.6     According to the Minister for the Environment in Northern Ireland (Alex       Attwood) at the launch of this exhibit in July 2011:     "Dunluce has a fantastic story to tell, full of intrigue, plotting and         rebellion.
This new exhibition makes the turbulent history of the Castle         accessible to everyone and shows what daily life would have been like         for those living here in the early 1600s.
It also displays some of the         superb finds from the archaeological excavations carried out in the Lost         Town of Dunluce over the last three summers.
"Just last month archaeologists unveiled new discoveries from the         town, including the footings of several stone and wooden houses, a         beautifully preserved roadway, jewellery and pottery.
We hope to have         some of these archaeological gems on display here soon.
"I am hoping to make progress in acquiring the lands that make up the         lost village of Dunluce and explore / exhaust potential heritage and         other funding to open up this little piece of Pompeii on the Antrim         coastline."
7     The combination of the university-led research and the success of the       engagement programme resulted in the Northern Ireland Environment Agency       significantly changing its policy towards the built heritage resource in       Northern Ireland.
Using Dunluce as an potential model of future       development led the organisation to employing 2 staff at the University of       Ulster to work directly on developing a Dunluce development funding       application6 and to investing &#163;200k in 2012 to purchase lands       adjacent to the Castle which contain the buried 17th-century       town, affording them State Care protection.6,10 The potential       for development of Dunluce as a centre of excellence in heritage       management and community education and participation was recognised by       Minister Atwood as its development was made a ministerial target.8,9     At the launch of Breen's book on Dunluce Castle in August 2012, Minister       Attwood stated:     "The book and Dunluce form part of the narrative of the Causeway Coast         - they demonstrate why we need to protect and develop the assets and to         do so now, sustainably and create jobs.
The Northern Ireland Environment         Agency is delighted to have a monument of the calibre of Dunluce Castle         in its care.
The archaeological excavations which inspired this book has         added greatly to our knowledge of Dunluce Castle, and for the public to         have the opportunity to see those excavations, and even take part in         them, was hugely exciting.
"The Agency purchased lands beside Dunluce Castle earlier this year.
This is the first step in what we anticipate will be an ambitious,         exciting and engaging project of excavation, interpretation and         conservation of the castle and the early 17th century town that was         excavated outside the castle gates-the `lost town of Dunluce'.
Not so         many years from now, our own little Pompeii could be revealed for all to         see and marvel."
10     Breen also worked with the NIEA board on the best options for sustainable       heritage management at Dunluce to enable the potential of the site to be       recognised.
This resulted in a successful HLF funding application worth       &#163;300k to develop a further bid for &#163;5m.6
