     KCL research demonstrated that treatment with supervised injectable       heroin leads to significantly       lower use of street heroin than treatment with supervised injectable       methadone or optimised oral       methadone.
Following pre-publication examination of the findings from the       RIOTT randomised trial,       UK Government policy identified supervised heroin maintenance treatment as       an evidence-based       treatment for previously unresponsive chronic heroin addicts.
Contribution to UK policy review: KCL researchers provided       confidential preliminary findings       from the RIOTT study to inform the Government's 2008 Drug Strategy.
The       strategy prioritised       "rolling out the prescription of injectable heroin and methadone to       clients who do not respond to       other forms of treatment, subject to the findings, due in 2009, of pilots       exploring the use of this type       of treatment" (1a).
KCL researchers also presented confidential findings       to, and were active       participants in, the 2009 National Treatment Agency (NTA) Expert Group       tasked with examining       the future role of Injectable Opioid Treatment (IOT) in England.
KCL       findings on the clinical and       cost-effectiveness of the RIOTT study, as well as studies from other       European countries,       constituted the central evidence of the report, which recommended a "phase       two of IOT, expanding       the number of clinics" which could "usefully learn from the RIOTT clinics       and explore different       models of IOT clinics to maximise cost efficiencies" (1b).
Following the aims of the 2010 Drugs Strategy, which committed to       continuing to "examine the       potential role of diamorphine prescribing for the small number who may       benefit" (1c), the       Department of Health (DH) set out the required actions of the NTA for       2011-12.
The Action Plan       continued an on-going commitment to working with KCL researchers and their       clinical partners to       develop a clinical consensus to focus practitioners and clients on       long-term recovery.
It also       contained specific action to "work with (the) DH to explore whether the         model demonstrated in         the RIOTT study can be made to work for the small number of people who         will benefit from         it" and a recommendation to tender new injectable treatment       contracts (1d).
In 2012 the DH issued an Invitation to Tender for Service Providers to       deliver IOT with an       estimated service operating costs of &#163;6 million over three years.
The DH         explicitly acknowledged         the contribution of the KCL RIOTT study and stated that "IOT is now       evidenced as a clinically       effective second line treatment for a small group of people who have       repeatedly failed to respond       either to standard methadone treatment or to residential rehabilitation"       (1e).
Additionally, in light of       KCL research, the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee on drugs policy       published in 2012       recommended "that the Government publish, by end of July 2013, clear       guidance on when and       how diamorphine should be used in substitution therapy" (1f) which is now       being applied in the       newly commissioned clinics.
The impact of KCL research on the development and provision of supervised       injectable opioid       treatment (IOT) for hard-to-treat heroin addicts is also stated in the       attached letter from the       National Treatment Agency (now Public Health England), dated June 2012:     "The work undertaken by Professor Strang and his colleagues has had a         significant impact on         the adoption of this particular treatment intervention in England,         ensuring that the supervised         self-administration of injectable opiates is now evidenced as a         clinically effective second line         treatment in The Department of Health's Drug Misuse and Dependence: UK         Guidelines on         Clinical Management, 2007, while the 2010 Drug Strategy committed to         "continue to examine         the potential role of diamorphine prescribing for the small number who         may benefit"     Providing a template for service delivery at home and abroad:       Early research from KCL       (Strang et al.
2000) was carried out in a pilot supervised clinic at the       South London and Maudsley       (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust.
The SLaM service became the template for         the subsequent         supervised injectable maintenance clinics in the RIOTT study and was       the site of the first of       the three new supervised clinics in which the definitive RIOTT study was       conducted.
SLaM       continues to be a key provider of the new Phase 2 supervised injecting       clinics, and within its       service, has demonstrated that 75% of patients with severe heroin       addiction significantly reduce       their use of street heroin (2a).
KCL research has also influenced services outside the UK.
For example, in         2009 Denmark         established the same system of provision of low-volume, high-intensity         supervised         injectable heroin maintenance clinics, modelled explicitly on the       SLaM service provision and       drawing directly on clinical as well as KCL research findings (2b).
Contribution to international initiatives: KCL researchers were       commissioned by the European       Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) to prepare a       European perspective on       heroin prescribing, gathering clinical, operational and research evidence       from across Europe and       Canada (3a).
The EMCDDA is a decentralised agency of the EU and exists to       provide the EU and       its member states with a factual overview of European drug problems and a       solid evidence base to       support the drugs debate.
The report reviews evidence from six injectable       heroin trials including       the RIOTT study, citing Strang 2010 (3a).
In recognition of its lasting       value, contribution to       government understanding, the EMCDDA report was selected by the Government       Documents       Round Table (GODORT) at the American Library Association as a notable       document of 2012 (3b).
Contributions to professional and public understanding: KCL       researchers have been actively       involved in disseminating their findings to raise awareness amongst health       professionals and       service users.
For instance, through a symposium on the findings from the       RIOTT study convened       by the charity Action on Addiction (`Untreatable or just hard-to-treat?")
in September 2009 (4a); an       audio interview for the Lancet to accompany the publication of the paper       (4b) and video interviews       on SLaM's YouTube page (4c, which as of July 2013 had been viewed nearly       2000 times) and, in       2010, for the Film Exchange on Alcohol and Drugs (FEAD), a public       engagement initiative of the       Lifeline Project, a charity delivering a range of drug addiction services       in the UK, aimed at services       users, the workforce and the wider community (4d).
KCL research         generated a high level of         media interest in the UK and internationally, with KCL researchers       communicating the RIOTT       finding both in this country, e.g.
BBC News (4e,f), BBC Radio 4 Today       Programme (4g) and       internationally, e.g.
CNN News (4h), TIME magazine (4i).
Development of new laboratory method to track use of `street heroin':       The development by       KCL researchers in collaboration with colleagues at Imperial College       London of the laboratory       urinanalysis papaverine assay (Paterson 2005) made possible an         objective laboratory assay of         compliance and treatment benefit.
Urine samples from the RIOTT trial       were analysed using this       method at the pathology service (now `Toxicology Unit') at King's College       Hospital (5a).
This new       method of differentiating between street heroin and pharmaceutical heroin       is applied in everyday       practice in the NHS clinics (3a), for instance samples from Tees, Esk and       Wear Valleys NHS       Foundation Trust are sent to the Toxicology Unit (5b).
