     The research questions addressed by the ECuity Projects were shaped by       the concerns of national policy-makers, health services professionals, and       international organisations, all of whom have an interest in truly       comparable findings across countries.
The motivation for ECuity II       responded to concerns that had been expressed in several European       countries over the possible adverse consequences, in terms of both equity       in health care utilisation and inequalities in health, of the continued       growth of user charges, private insurance and of income inequality.
ECuity       III focused on the transmission of inequalities in health to old age, and       the inequitable treatment of the elderly by health care systems,       reflecting differences in insurance coverage and pension entitlement.
To engage with health policy-makers the ECuity Project communicated its       findings through policy-oriented conferences and journals as well as in       peer-reviewed academic journals.
The ECuity II and III Projects held       annual workshops that were attended by representatives from international       organisations (OECD, WB, WHO).
These were the most direct route through       which the methods and findings reached a non-academic audience (ECuity III       workshops were in Belgirate, 2003; Helsinki, 2004; IZA Bonn, 2005).
Furthermore, the findings were presented and discussed at meetings with       officials from several international organisations, including the EU,       OECD, WB and WHO.
The assimilation of the methods and the use of evidence       by these international decision makers can be traced in their publications       and official statistics: for the EU see for example Eurostat (2010a &amp;       2010b); for the OECD see Devaux and Looper (2012), Marcial et al.
(2008),       and Verbist et al.
(2011); for the WB see Smith and Nam (2013); and for       the WHO Mladovsky et al.
(2009).
Evidence of the assimilation of the research done at York at the       international level is provided by factual statement [1] from the Director       of the Health Systems and Financing Department at the World Health       Organisation based in Geneva:     "Redressing inequalities in health has always been fundamental to the         work of the World Health Organization.
The ECuity Projects in their         various forms were valuable in helping WHO think through many questions         linked to how to do this.
I refer to four areas as examples.
The fact that inequalities in health are linked to inequalities in         income, as confirmed by the ECuity Project, was not itself surprising,         but the fact that income related inequalities were growing in many         countries was.
Equally as important was the development by the Project         of a way of rigorously comparing indices of inequality in health that         allows the contribution of inequalities in income to be clearly         identified.
At the same time the Project, for example in the work of Silvia           Balia and Andrew Jones, showed that individual choices about lifestyle           influence mortality independently from social and economic factors.
This is critical for identifying what can be done to reduce the risks           of premature mortality.
In papers by Eddy van Doorslaer and Andrew Jones, and by           Cristina Hernandez, Andrew Jones and Nigel Rice, the Project explored           the area of self-report bias and heterogeneity in self-assessed health           responses, something that has long concerned the World Health           Organization.
Self-assessed health responses are simpler to undertake           than measured tests, but the capacity to compare them over time or           across settings is a concern.
The finding that at least in the UK           self-assessment did not seem to vary consistently with socio-economic           characteristics of patients was somewhat reassuring.
The Organization's work on health financing strategies was           helped by the ECuity Project's analysis of the role health shocks play           in the decision to retire, something that is also linked to the           generosity of the country's social security system &#8212; explored in           papers by Andrew Jones, Nigel Rice and colleagues.
This has           implications for the sustainability of financing for health based on           wage deductions, as well as for understanding the broader implications           of poor health for overall social welfare."
Evidence of changes in practice within the World Bank is provided in       factual statements [2] and [3].
A Senior Economist in the Health and       Nutrition Unit, Eastern Europe and Central Asia at the World Bank       describes the influence on practice at the Bank in factual statement [2]:     "The methods and tools initially developed in the context of the         ECuity project are now frequently used to measure the performance of         health systems, to inform policy dialogue, and to build capacity in         client countries.
The World Bank developed a module to automate health         equity analyses in the free software platform ADePT and is promoting its         use both within and outside the institution.
Most recently (2012-2013),         the Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Health, Nutrition and         Population Unit of the World Bank used ECuity-inspired analyses to         discuss financial protection in a forthcoming regional report and         develop monographs on equity in outcomes, utilization and health         financing in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, the results of which were         presented in national workshops."
The impact on policy formulation in the Asia and Pacific region is       described in factual statement [3] by a Senior Economist in the East Asia       Human Development Group, World Bank:       "Providing evidence-based advice on inequalities in health and their         determinants is very important to our clients and partners....The ECuity         project, which the University of York has contributed to over several         years, has had tremendous impact on research and analysis of health         equity.
The project has provided the methodological framework and tools         to carry our research on health equity in low and middle-income         countries, which is used regularly by the World Bank in formulating         policy advice to our client governments."
In summary: The methods developed in the ECuity Project have had a       significant impact on the definition and measurement of health equity       within international organisations with evidence of reach across developed       and developing countries including the activities of the WHO and the World       Bank in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and in East Asia.
