     The Oxford Road Vision influenced Manchester's economic and       cultural development policy: `The sense of place and public realm is         vital to attract and retain high-calibre staff and businesses to the         area, to lead to re-investment and potential Foreign Direct Investment.
Societal value is also provided to surrounding communities, students and         visitors' (taken from Manchester's 2009 Strategic Vision).
Hyatt's       work inspired the formation of the Corridor Manchester partnership, the       first of its kind in the UK, bringing together Manchester City Council,       the University of Manchester, MMU and the Central Manchester University       Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust to develop the 243-hectare area originally       identified by Hyatt.
http://www.corridormanchester.com/about-us       says, `We anticipate ... capital investments up to 2020 ... over &#163;2.5       billion (mostly through private sector finance)'.
The Corridor Manchester       partners as well as Bruntwood, Cornerhouse (Cinema and Gallery),       Manchester Science Parks and Arup invested evenly throughout the REF       period 2008-2013 (&#163;1,739,586).
As Phase 1 of a &#163;5m project, impact can be       evidenced through the leverage of European Regional Development Fund       (ERDF) monies to support Public Realm (2010-12) improvements to over       25,000 sq metres.
Hyatt's Oxford Road Vision and the accompanying       Avenue of Giants documents changed institutional practices and       policies and gave Manchester's Oxford Road a revitalised sense of place       and cultural identity.
The Director of Manchester Digital Development       Agency confirms Hyatt's role in the Oxford Road's redevelopment, "Professor         John Hyatt has worked tirelessly and deliberately to have a real impact         upon the City of Manchester and promoting its image (and reality) as a         global city, collaborating and competing with the best of international         centres and with local innovation initiatives in partnership with         ourselves.
His research into the history of Manchester as a site of         revolutionary thought ...(he) went onto incorporate into his Vision for         Oxford Road, describing the road as the birthplace of revolutionary         thought and making that history open to the public through appearances         on local radio and in the press to promote a vision for the road's         development.
John presented also to the City Council and the North West         Development Agency and his clarity was influential in the adoption of         plans to develop the road.
He gave a new idea for the road."
[B]     Hyatt utilised this sense of `place' as a catalyst for collaborative       projects to demonstrate increased global reach and cultural impact.
Bringing together his underpinning ISEA98 methodology and his       research in China, Hyatt delivered another multi-agency international       event, State Legacy: Research in the Visualisation of Political         History, with Cornerhouse Gallery in 2009.
State Legacy was       a large exhibition of contemporary Chinese art, in Shenzhen, China, and       along Manchester's Oxford Road Corridor at Cornerhouse.
Co-curated with       Huang Zhuan, Director of OCT in Shenzhen, with commissioned works from Lu       Hao, Sui Jianguo, Wang Guangyi, Wang Jianwei, and Zeng Li, artists entered       public forums and enhanced understanding of cultural diversity.
Popular       press reported, `Spread over two sites, the results are visually         striking and have a lasting resonance, even for viewers without any         knowledge of China's history or culture' (Metro, 09/04/09).
Consulting engineers on the Beijing Olympic stadium, Arup provided free IT       support, became full partners in the project and benefited from the       cultural exchange opportunities that were developed [C].
Xu Wang       (Beijing Olympics) provided the branding and over 9,000 visitors visited       the exhibition [D].
A competition enabled a UK artist to undertake       a funded residency in China.
A full programme of public engagement events       at Cornerhouse including evening classes on Chinese history and culture,       public seminars, photographic workshops and children's events accompanied       State Legacy.
Hyatt used a guided tour to delegates of the       MIRIAD-hosted Association of Art Historian's conference to create a       podcast to disseminate the curatorial vision behind the exhibition [E].
State Legacy also generated important economic connections within the       private sector through a special North West Business Insider breakfast       linking Chinese and UK-based business leaders.
A 571pp bilingual academic       publication was produced.
Talking about the impact of the exhibition in Manchester, the Director of       Cornerhouse corroborates, "The show was a major success and a UK first         and that presented previously unseen works by five prominent         contemporary Chinese artists.
The exhibition featured new commissions         responding to the achievements and problems of China's recent         industrialisation and modernisation, generating debate about the role of         art in post-industrial societies.
It was well attended (over 9,000         visits) and well reviewed.
State Legacy revived the connection between         Manchester School of Arts and Cornerhouse leading to our mutual         engagement with the Asia Triennial."
[D] (see ATM case       study).
In China, the audience was carefully developed and 50 scholars, media and       critics attended the Shenzhen seminar.
China News Weekly reported       that it `set a milestone example for curating which used a reflective         attitude to political history and art'.
New Weekly described       it as `exhibition of the year', and `...an academic event that         was influential amongst intellectuals'.
A symposium at Hexiangning       Art Museum, Shenzhen, was attended by 15 Chinese art critics,       philosophers, artists, curators and researchers.
A Symposium in Beijing       and a special edition of research publication DuShu magazine followed with       33 international articles and reviews published in total.
State Legacy       had an impact upon Chinese culture and OCT practices: Zhuan said, `During         the two-year period of this project, for the first time, Chinese artists         have had a serious, intellectual and creative discussion about their own         state and its historical evolution during modernisation'.
In the       Spanish magazine Art in China, he stated that `Our         collaboration with MIRIAD at MMU has developed an open and         multi-dimensional angle for the project, and lent it a symbolic meaning'.
It led to an enhancement of Zhuan's career and international reputation.
He was invited to present at the Red Legacy in China conference,       organized by Fairbank Center for China Studies, Harvard, 2010.
Generating       &#163;95,054.50 income in the UK, State Legacy gave employment to 264       workers.
Hyatt continues with various projects on Manchester's Oxford Rd: he is       artist-in-residence with Manchester Camerata (2011 and 2013) investigating       the interface between the visual and the auditory in 8 x new technology       public concert collaborations with the orchestra.
The Manchester Camerata,       Creative Director described impacts to date as, `invaluable [in]         exploring the new and fresh ideas and approaches which have been brought         to our programme and general thinking through this artist-in-residence         collaboration'.
[F, G]     In 2012, Manchester City Council used ERDF funding to commission Hyatt       and architect Craig Martin to design and install a bespoke solar-powered       public artwork, Fireflies, in All Saints Park in the heart of the       Manchester Oxford Road Corridor [H].
Fireflies is part of       Phase 1 ERDF investment.
Thus, Hyatt has become a direct beneficiary of       his earlier research, proving a sustainable, regenerative ecology of       research and impact.
Hyatt's research continues to have an economic and cultural influence       over the regeneration of the city of Manchester.
Talking about this       ongoing impact the Director of Cornerhouse says, "His research and         thinking has underpinned much to the approach to developing culture with         the Corridor area and paved the way for the creation of HOME, our new         &#163;25m, 6,500 m2 arts centre that will open in 2015.
Professor Hyatt         linked a range of artistic, scientific, political and historical         `landmarks' to place, more specifically the corridor which is the area         that bestrides Oxford Road, and this has helped us understand it's         personality and so informed its development.
In addition to the         significant capital investments that are being made to regenerate the         artistic and cultural landscape of the Corridor we have built a         coordinated approach to promotion and audience building through the         Culture on the Corridor board.
This is unlikely to have happened without         Avenue of the Giants.
