     York research has had an impact on policy and practice in relation to the       measurement of overall NHS productivity and the analysis of variations in       productivity at hospital and at consultant level.
National NHS productivity     The annual NHS budget is approximately &#163;106 billion, accounting for 8.2%       of gross national product.
By developing improved methods of measuring NHS       productivity and providing methodologically robust evidence on annual NHS       productivity growth, York research has played a significant role in the       processes by which the size of the NHS budget is determined.
The 2002       Spending Review committed the Government to a new Public Service Agreement       target of 2% improvements in productivity per year.
The DoH turned to York       researchers to find a way to incorporate quality of care improvements into       the measurement of the output of the NHS.
This had not previously been       attempted.
The methods that York developed then were adopted as national       policy and have been used continuously.
These methods are incorporated       into the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates of NHS       productivity, which feed into the annual UK National Accounts (source 1).
Every year since, the ONS has used the method developed by York as a key       element in their triangulation of evidence.
The statement "ONS would         like to thank Professor Andrew Street, Dr Adriana Castelli and the         Centre for Health Economics (CHE) team at the University of York for         their work on healthcare quality adjustments" appears in all ONS       publications relating to NHS productivity.
The ONS states that "Estimates         of Health gain, Short-term survival and Waiting times are provided by         the Centre for Health Economics (CHE) at the University of York.
These         are derived from patient-level records and offer detailed information at         the level of the individual procedure for Inpatients and Day-cases.
These are combined into a single measure of quality following the         guidance of CHE et al ...." (source 2).
These quality       adjustments have added an average of 0.5 percentage points to estimates of       annual output growth (source 2) and without York's research, NHS       productivity would have been underestimated with negative consequences for       the size of future budget settlements for the NHS and hence less       investment in NHS services.
Estimates of input, output and productivity growth, along with details       of the methodological issues that York research addresses, are produced       regularly for the DoH for use in their calculations of NHS productivity.
Researchers have produced a tool for DoH analysts to use in order to       explore in detail the productivity estimates and the impact of different       assumptions on future productivity estimates.
The estimates provided by       York are vital for negotiations with ministers and with agencies that have       the power to influence the size of the NHS budget.
The research has been       used directly to provide numerical answers and context for Health Select       Committees and Public Accounts Committees, and Hansard records show that       York is often cited by name (source 3).
The National Audit Office       report on Agenda for Change raised the issue of how measures of NHS output       were quality adjusted and, at the Public Accounts Committee, the DoH       responded by referring to the research commissioned from York in order to       improve the method of adjustment (source 4).
The 2008/9 Public       Expenditure Inquiry asked for a progress report on the York work and in       answering the question the DoH cited the York study on inputs and also       indicated that York would be producing productivity estimates at a       Strategic Health Authority level (source 5).
York research has also been influential internationally.
Representatives       from the Italian, Swedish and Japanese governments visited York in 2011,       2012 and 2013 respectively, to learn more about the methods used to       measure productivity in the UK.
York researchers are working on       measurement of productivity for the Italian Ministry of Health (with       colleagues at the University of Rome Tor Vergata), replicating for Italy,       the methods used in England.
York staff have run invited workshops on       methods of productivity measurement to policy makers, national       statisticians and academics nationally and internationally.
Specialist hospital care     Research on the costs of specialist care was commissioned from York as       part of "a fundamental review of the current methodology" used to       calculate specialised service top-ups for the Payment by Results tariff (source         6).
Our research resulted in changes in policy in 2011/12, including       the introduction of new top-ups for neurosciences and spinal surgery and       revision of the level of existing top-ups for children's services and       orthopaedics (source 6, paras 11 and 94-101).
York's report is       included on the DoH website alongside the Payment by Results Guidance       documents.
Hospital consultant productivity     Staff costs are the largest single component of NHS expenditure.
York       research into productivity at consultant level has had significant policy       impacts in three ways.
Firstly, the method of describing and exploring       variation in consultant productivity was adopted as a benchmarking tool by       the DoH's Workforce Directorate and the NHS Institute of Innovation and       Improvement as part of their `Delivering Quality and Value' programme,       which in 2008 distributed comparative data on consultant clinical activity       to all hospital Trusts in England (source 7).
This document states       that their process: "uses the methodology outlined in York University's         report: Measuring Productivity of Hospital Consultants using Hospital         Episode Statistics in England".
Second, this research influenced the recent review of clinical excellence       awards by the Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body (DDRB).
In evidence to       the Review Body, Bloor and Maynard recommended "introducing an extended       career structure for doctors, with earned increments and a senior       consultant grade" and this recommendation was adopted by the DDRB in their       report (source 8), and a `principal consultant grade' is now under       negotiation with the British Medical Association (source 9).
Our       work was also cited by the DoH in their submission to DDRB: "research         by the University of York ... showed that consultants in surgical         specialties with local Clinical Excellence Awards were those who had the         highest levels of productivity" (source 10).
The DDRB review       team contacted York for supplementary evidence and further details, and       cited York research (references 6 and 7 above) in their final report (source         8).
Finally, the findings of our evaluation of the effect of the consultant       contract reform on consultant productivity (reference 8) informed the       recent National Audit Office review of the management of NHS consultants:       "recent work by York University shows a downwards trend in finished         episodes per consultant ... [the researchers] concluded that the         contract had no or a negative impact on the declining trend in the ten         specialty areas analysed" (source 11).
