     Professor Ellis' work involves a significant range of both on-campus and       off-campus activity.
He has been involved in establishing iMUSE rooms in a       range of institutions, such as special schools, specialist institutions       for autism, day care centres, and an NHS intensive care centre.
His work       has also involved knowledge transfer to enable partner organizations to       use the techniques he has developed, along with appropriate supporting       technology.
His research projects have looked at:            Developing new digital interfaces for children with special needs       Tactile Interactive Multimedia for children with hearing impairment         and visual impairment, including the blind and deaf       Developing interactive multi-sensory environments (iMUSE) for the         elderly in long-term care, to develop new interfaces to give control to         elderly, frail and mentally infirm people.
iMUSE research is carried out in association with schools and care homes       in the community, and also at the Sound Therapy Lab installed at the       University of Sunderland in 2006, which was supported by funding from the       regional Centre for Excellence         in Teaching and Learning 'Music and Inclusivity'.
The Sound Therapy Lab provides a customized environment for one-to-one       interactive sessions.
Participants can:            engage with the multi-sensory environment according to their needs and         preferences, either sitting in a chair, wheelchair, on a beanbag or the         floor       control mutually related sound, visuals and vibrations by using their         voice or body movements.
A typical one-to-one iMUSE session takes about 30 minutes.
Participants       are seated in a vibro-acoustic chair, which transforms sound into       vibration.
Additionally, sound can be transferred into complex changing       visual patterns through visualization software, such as G-Force, Arkaos,       etc.
The graphical feedback is projected on to a screen in front of the       participant.
iMUSE interactions have been shown to support: expression,       communication, aesthetic resonance, awareness of control, exploration and       ludic engagement.
During iMUSE sessions for children with special needs the following       progression has been observed:                                From           Involuntary           Accidental           Indifference           Confined           Gross           Exploratory           Solitary                             To           Voluntary           Intended           Interest           Expressive           Fine           Preconceived           Individual                          During iMUSE sessions for elderly in long-term care, the following       progression has been observed:                                From&#160; dependent           Isolated           Indifferent           Frowning           Crying           Silent           Withdrawn           Inward                             To responsive           Aware           Reactive           Smiling           Laughing           Content           Thoughtful           Poised                             To&#160; independent           Contributing           Expressive           Laughing           Expressing           Receptive           Communicative           Interactive                          At Hollybank school in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, they have built a       dedicated iMUSE room for their residential and part time young people and       adults with disabilities.
The importance of the iMUSE initiative is       confirmed by Hollybank's Creative Project Development Manager:     `iMUSE has revolutionized what we do for young people and adults within       the trust.
It has opened up a whole new world in which the children and       adults can compose, own, communicate and just explore themselves.
Its just       been amazing the difference and the change that's happened with our folks       here.
It's been wonderful, really wonderful...' (May, 2008).

The Adult Service Manager says it       helps to empower people: `It allows the individual to take control of the       environment.
It's all about control and empowerment.
This studio       represents a major move forward in the options available to people with       profound and complex needs, not only to participate in an enjoyable music       and relaxation session, but to develop and produce beautiful art work,       which not only provides creative expression for the individual, but also       has the potential to provide real employment opportunities for individuals       to promote and sell their work through the development of our new social       enterprise and employability projects' (8 September, 2011).
