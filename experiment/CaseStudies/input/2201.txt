     Increasing access to finance for excluded groups:             Through projects funded by Lloyds TSB, Barclays Bank, Esm&#233;e Fairbairn         Foundation, the Housing Corporation and European Regional Development         Fund, during the early 2000s CFS helped to set up eleven MFIs in England         (in Salford, Portsmouth, Blackburn, Preston, Derby, Sandwell, Blackpool,         East London, Cumbria, Suffolk and Devon), each of which built in lower         operational costs and greater efficiency than pre-existing models for         MFIs.
Nine of these are still functioning.
The most successful has been         the East Lancashire Moneyline (IPS) Ltd., (ELM) from Blackburn (with CFS         on its Board), which grew from a single office in January 2001 to 25         branches throughout the UK in 2012, employing 50 staff.
ELM's customers often do not have bank accounts and may have accrued         unmanageable debts, partly through prior high-interest loan arrangements         with money lenders.
A typical customer has loans outstanding of &#163;500,         with interest standing at approximately &#163;80 per &#163;100.
ELM is able to         offer affordable finance to these more disadvantaged, marginalised and         at-risk groups on low incomes who would not normally be able to access         loans from banks.
Winning the `Responsible Lender of the Year' award in         2012, ELM made 21,000 loans in 2012 &#8212; roughly 1,750 every month, and         twice the number granted in 2011 &#8212; for a total of more than &#163;10 million.
A customer at East Lancashire Moneyline: "I don't know where I'd be           without you, to be honest with you.
You've been a godsend."
A key challenge is identifying predictors of default in what the         banks would consider a `subprime' sector.
Apart from recommending simple         and socially relevant decision criteria, through two KTPs, CFS developed         a web-based Credit Risk Assessment Tool to aid in the processing of loan         applications.
Diane Burridge, Chief Financial Officer of the ELM         commented that "The research has helped us to actually have the           confidence to expand into more geographical locations.
We ultimately           want to make the business national, and it means more people who           wouldn't necessarily have had access to the service will have access           to affordable finance".
The project is the first of its kind in         the sub-prime finance market.
Total number of loans since inception: 65045.
Total value of loans: &#163;37,225,431.
Number of people having used the service: 25,264.
Total amount in savings: &#163;3,283,159 (this is the total amount           deposited since inception, not the current value on deposit).
With regard to the impact on defaults; write-offs as a % of gross           lending have reduced from 14.3% in 2009 to 8.8% in 2013.
"We have significantly reduced the impact of taking on new           business in new geographic locations as a result of having the risk           database to support new staff in new locations as a result of the           KTP."
Diane Burridge 		         Supporting public authorities in developing financial inclusion           policies: 		          Between 2008 and 2013, CFS provided advice, consultation and         recommendations to financial organisations, local authorities and         housing authorities dealing with the financially excluded.
Funded         research projects were completed for the Friends Provident Foundation         (2008, and 2010), Leeds City Council (2009), Barnsley MBC (2009) and         Rochdale MBC (2010).
Dayson was invited to contribute to recommendations         developed by Glasgow City Council's Sounding Board on Payday Lending,         which will be implemented to promote financial inclusion in the city.
Changing EU policy: A model of sustainability and transparency for           MFIs: 		          2010-onwards: In 2010 CFS was approached to draft the Code of         Good Conduct for Microfinance Institutions (MFIs), for and in close         cooperation with the European Commission.
The purpose of the Code of         Good Conduct is to develop a set of expectations and standards that are         common to the microfinance sector in the European Union for the benefit         of customers, investors, funders, owners, regulators and partner         organisations.
The project consisted of an extensive review of existing         codes of conduct and guidelines for MFIs in the EU and beyond,         facilitation of stakeholder and expert workshops, and consultation and         discussions with MFI trade bodies.
The Code             of Conduct for European Microcredit Providers, has now been         adopted by the Directorate-General for Regional Policy.
Research         conducted at CFS is particularly reflected in the chapters on risk         management, reporting standards and management information systems.
The         European Parliament is in the process of adopting the content of the         University's European Code of Conduct for Microcredit providers as an         essential requirement for future EU funding.
