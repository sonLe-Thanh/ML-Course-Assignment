     Lettered references relate to items in Section 5.
Public and private sector investment into technologies for CCS         (Primary Impact)     Pathway: SCCS research outputs, as described in Sections 2 and 3,       have been directly used in national and European level policy formation.
Furthermore, the research has led to Haszeldine being a recognised CCS       expert and advisor, regularly consulted by decision-makers within both       government and the electricity generation industry.
This standing is       evident in the creation of the world's first personal professorship in CCS       (2009, funded by ScottishPower) and the award of an OBE (2012) for       'services to climate change technologies'.
Within UK Government,       Haszeldine has acted as an advisor to the UK Minister for Energy (2007       onwards) and been part of DECC Advisory Groups to the Chief Scientist and       on CCS Development (both 2009 onwards).
Within Scottish Government,       Haszeldine has acted as advisor to the Energy Minister (2009 onwards).
Haszeldine has also been involved in bringing forwards research-based       policy briefing documents, such as two published in 2008 with Policy       Exchange, on the topic of UK readiness for CCS implementation [A].
Significance and reach:            The UK Government re-affirmed a &#163;1billion commitment to CCS funding in         the 2010 Spending Review, as of 2012 described by the DECC Secretary of         State as a 'CCS Commercialisation Programme'.
The influence of both SCCS         research and the expert advice given by Haszeldine in the set-up and         subsequent operation of the Programme is corroborated by a statement         from the then Director of the DECC CCS Office [B].
The specific         contribution from Edinburgh research in helping DECC to secure the &#163;1         billion of public funding is further corroborated by the text of a         January 2011 speech given to the Scottish Government Energy Committee by         the then Secretary of State for Energy [C].
The influence of Edinburgh research in the UK Government's wider         support for CCS is evident in a speech by the Prime Minister on 28 July         2010: `We believe we can have a technology leadership on this,           developed through some of our best universities, like Edinburgh ...           that are doing incredible work on carbon capture and storage.
That's           the sort of technology we can then share, and export and invest with           other countries' [D].
The incorporation of CCS into the Scottish Government's Electricity         Generation Policy Statement (June 2013) cites in its evidence base a         2012 report co-authored by SCCS [E].
The continent wide map of onshore/offshore CO2 storage         (research output [4], Section 3) is cited in the evidence base of the         European Commission decision to place CCS pipelines into 2012         infrastructure package negotiations, with allocated funds of ~         &#8364;2.5billion [F].
The influence of SCCS research on the 2009 launch by ScottishPower of         the Longannet CCS consortium (partners: National Grid / Shell), [text         removed for publication], is corroborated by a statement from their then         Head of CCS Development [G].
This also led to provision of CPD         courses for 160 teachers and outreach programmes for 1500 members of the         public.
The influence of expert advice given by Haszeldine, during a UK-FCO         Science mission to the USA, on the decision of Summit Power to enter the         DECC CCS Commercialisation Programme as lead developer of the Captain         Clean Energy project (April 2013) is corroborated by a statement from         their CEO [H].

Public engagement with, and understanding of, issues related to CCS         (Secondary Impact)     Pathway, significance and reach: Haszeldine has been a leading       voice in the dissemination of CCS-related information and comment,       achieved through sustained dialogues over the period 2008 - July 2013 with       TV, radio and the printed media.
For example, Haszeldine has discussed       carbon storage issues on BBC Radio 4 `Material World' (October 2010, Radio       4 has a UK reach of up to 10.98M in quarterly 2013 Radio Joint Audience       Research figures), BBC `Newsnight Scotland' (October 2011, average viewers       664k), New Scientist (March 2011, circulation 2.5M) and various       online news pieces, one of which `Carbon Storage?
Not Under my house!'
(November 2009) was carried by &gt;150 sources in the US and Netherlands       (combined circulation &gt;90million) [I].
