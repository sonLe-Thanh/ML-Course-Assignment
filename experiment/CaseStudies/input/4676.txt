     Context       In the late 1990s, the UK government recognised financial exclusion as an       important aspect of social exclusion.
PFRC research showed that a       significant minority of people in the UK &#8212; often the most vulnerable       people in our society &#8212; were outside mainstream financial services and       exclusion imposed real costs on them.
Households that operate solely on a       cash budget are: i) unable to make savings via direct debits on utility       bills, ii) more vulnerable to loss or theft if they don't have home       contents insurance, and iii) far more likely to use the sub-prime credit       market &#8212; paying interest many times that of a standard personal loan.
Nature of impact     PFRC's research described the number and types of UK households that were     excluded or self-excluded from mainstream financial services and showed that     financial exclusion extended beyond access to bank and building society     branches to other aspects of people's financial lives such as credit and     saving.
This was an important step forward for developing comprehensive     financial inclusion policy and interventions to improve financial access.
Low-income households benefit from introduction of basic bank accounts       PFRC's research set out an empirically-based blueprint for a bank account       better suited to the needs of people on low incomes than a traditional       current account [1].
Evidence of this blueprint (notably no credit       facility but ideally a small `buffer zone') can be seen in the basic bank       accounts that were introduced by banks and building societies from 2002-03       and are still available today [a].
Basic bank accounts were instrumental in bringing more people into       banking.
The proportion of low-income households without a bank account       dropped from 20-25% in the late 1990s, to 8% in 2002/03 and 3% in 2010/11       [b].
In a piece of work commissioned by the Financial Inclusion Taskforce in       2009, Finney undertook a quantitative analysis of the unbanked using the       Family Resources Survey [c].
This informed changes in how the numbers of       unbanked were calculated and demonstrated that a shared government-banking       industry target for reducing the number of unbanked had been met.
In human       terms, this meant that between 2002 and 2009 the number of adults living       in households without access to a bank account fell from two million to       890,000 [d, pg 4].
Low-income households benefit from access to affordable credit       The Department for Works &amp; Pensions (DWP) Growth Fund increased access       to affordable credit through credit unions and other non-profit lenders       between 2006 and 2011.
In 2010, PFRC conducted an impact evaluation of       this programme [5], which led to a feasibility study by the DWP in 2012 to       examine the modernisation and expansion of credit unions [e, pg 7].
In June 2012, DWP announced they would make a further investment of &#163;38       million over the next three years in credit unions, in addition to the &#163;13       million invested in 2011/12.
Managed by the main credit union trade       association, the expansion project aims to attract up to one million more       credit union members.
Based on estimates produced in the PFRC evaluation,       this credit union expansion could save consumers around &#163;1 billion in loan       interest payments.
In addition, research led by Kempson on the feasibility of a non-profit       home credit service was repeatedly referred to in parliamentary debates on       the Financial Services Bill [f, column 561].
HM Treasury benefits from research in developing national savings         scheme       Drawing directly on PFRC's evaluation that showed matched saving to be       effective among the target group of low-income working age households [6],       new legislation was drafted to roll out the Saving Gateway scheme.
Kempson       was an adviser to HM Treasury on that roll out.
Collard gave oral evidence to the Saving Gateway Accounts Bill Committee       in evidence sessions 27 January-5 February 2009 [g, pg 9], and PFRC       research is cited in the Committee research paper [h, pg 12] and       explanatory notes to the Bill for the House of Commons and the House of       Lords [i, pg 2].
The Bill established a government subsidised savings       scheme for people of working age on low incomes and was passed on 2nd July       2009.
From July 2010, the nationwide 'Saving Gateway' scheme was to be       launched, with an estimated 8 million people on low incomes set to benefit       [h, pg 15].
The Coalition Government subsequently cancelled the scheme on       the basis of cost.
Reach       The approach developed by PFRC to understand and measure financial       exclusion led directly to similar research in India [j] and Australia [k]       to establish the extent and nature of financial exclusion among their       adult populations.
In 2008, PFRC was the scientific lead and expert partner on a European       Commission study to identify the most effective policy measures to prevent       financial exclusion [l].
In the course of the study, PFRC advised Eurostat       (the statistical office of the European Union) on the design of surveys to       capture financial exclusion in member states.
As a direct result of the       study, in February 2009 the European Commission launched a public       consultation on ensuring access to basic bank accounts in Member States       [m].
Following the consultation, in July 2011 the Commission adopted a       Recommendation on access to a basic payment account and more recently in       May 2013 a proposal for a Directive on access to a basic payment account       [n].
