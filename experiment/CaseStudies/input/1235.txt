     Dibben's monograph on Bj&#246;rk's music had a direct impact on the artist and       her creative team, by identifying, articulating and evidencing the       artistic value of Bj&#246;rk's work.
Bj&#246;rk remarked of the book: "I liked it         because it wasn't about my boyfriends or my children which female         artists get a lot ... but seemed to be quite up front and down to earth         about my music.
She also seemed to be able to cover both the electronic         and the more academic angle of my music which is rare.
You either have         the pop folks being intimidated about the string and the choir         arrangements or you get the semi classical lot who sort of seem keen of         "promoting" me into being a composer my fair lady style.
Like they want         to rescue me from pop.
Which I am quite comfortable and proud to be part         of.
Nicola Dibben seemed not to care about either of those hurdles."
(Bj&#246;rk, The Guardian, 2011).
Her manager remarked in an email to       Dibben in 2009 that even though he'd known Bj&#246;rk's work for 20 years,       Dibben's research had given him new ways to understand and appreciate her       music.
Based on the insights Dibben provided in that monograph, and her       non-elitist attitude to music and music-education (see the quotation from       Bj&#246;rk above), Bj&#246;rk invited Dibben to work with her on her next album       project &#8212; Biophilia (2011).
Beyond Bj&#246;rk and her creative team,       Dibben's research had three additional types of impact: creative and       cultural, quality of life and understanding, and economic.
1.
Creative and cultural impact: supporting a new form of artistic       expression     Dibben's research contributed to a new type of musical artefact, the "app       album", widely referred to as a reinvention of the album format and a       touchstone for future developments in music for mobile devices (e.g.
LATimes,       The Guardian, 2011).
The Biophilia app is the first       interactive music album for mobile devices, as part of which, songs are       presented as interactive, semi-educational games based on structures       derived from the natural world.
The current version has more than a 70% 5       star rating from purchasers in the App Store (AppAnnie, 2013).
Dibben contributed to the design of the Biophilia apps: she       provided feedback on the musical and educational components to the       developers based on her understanding of Bj&#246;rk's compositional aims, and       worked with the designers and Bj&#246;rk to create an appropriate layering of       the text within the app architecture.
Dibben's research also added       creative value through the inclusion of essays within the Bj&#246;rk         Biophilia app album (2011), and physical album releases (Biophilia         Ultimate Edition, 2011; Biophilia Manual, 2011).
Notably,       this was the first time Bj&#246;rk integrated academic research into her       creative artefacts, and a rare (perhaps only) instance of a collaboration       between an academic and internationally-renowned pop musician on an album       project.
In addition, Dibben's research had a creative and cultural impact       on audiences of Bj&#246;rk's music through its presentation as interpretive       material within the apps ("a stunning analytical essay put together by       Nikki Dibben", 2020k, 2011; "fascinating essays" The         Telegraph, 2011), a 7000 word programme (Biophilia Live       2011), and as the exhibition text accompanying the world tour of live       performances, where it was incorporated both as subtitles accompanying       documentary films, and stand-alone text displayed on plasma screens (e.g.
Harpa concert hall, Reykjavik, October-November 2011).
Based on an       estimated 5,000 attendees during the Reykjavik residency, the exhibition       could reach a total 40,000 people by the end of the tour in 2014.
2.
Quality of life and understanding.
Dibben's research had cultural and societal impact on the international       reception of Bj&#246;rk's music and of the new app-album format.
For example,       she was one of three members of the creative team who represented Biophilia       at the press launch in June 2011; she collaborated with Bj&#246;rk's manager       and personal assistant to write press releases for Biophilia; and       wrote the app descriptions for the iTunes store which guide purchasers'       decisions.
Phrases from her press releases appear in international press       coverage of the release of Biophilia showing a direct impact of       her words on journalists' understanding of Bj&#246;rk's work, and potentially       on public reception of Biophilia.
Dibben's exhibition materials       were also used by critics to inform their reviews: "According to an         essay on display in the lobby, along with half a dozen video screens         showing graphics and film clips associated with the album, biophilia is         an ancient philosophical notion..." (review by David Fricke in Rolling         Stone, 2011).
The Biophilia project continues to receive       world-wide press coverage from hundreds of media outlets: a google search       with the terms "Bj&#246;rk Biophilia" reveals in excess of 1,260,000 hits.
In       the UK alone there were 176 stories listed in the NewsBank newspaper       database, and BBC News featured Biophilia 15 times.
Dibben also       used her knowledge of the connections between music and nature to justify       the conceptual appropriateness of the Biophilia live show for the       New York Hall of Science as part of a bid to use the museum as a venue,       thereby influencing the connections audiences would draw between music and       science.
Dibben's research reached audiences through a variety of artefacts and       activities.
Dibben's most visible contributions to the Biophilia       app are the ten essays that accompany the album's ten songs.
These texts       inform audiences of the conceptual underpinnings of the project: in the       words of Bj&#246;rk's manager, "I think that to realise the aims of         including an education and learning aspect to the project &#8212; your writing         on each song would be a very important aspect of the project" (email       to Dibben from Manager of One Little Indian, 2010).
Two aspects of       Dibben's research impacted on Bj&#246;rk during the process, and then on       subsequent audiences: first, Bj&#246;rk wanted to communicate her ideas about       musical structure to a mass audience &#8212; a principle Dibben had advocated in       her monograph Bj&#246;rk; and second, Dibben applied her understanding       of the relationship between Bj&#246;rk's compositional strategies and ideas of       nature and technology to interpret, and promote understanding of the Biophilia       project for a global audience (e.g.
"you really get the full experience         of the music and the rationale behind its conception and creation",       Scientific American, 2011).
Dibben was also commissioned by Bj&#246;rk       to interview her and others in order to document the creative process,       extracting interview material for the record company to use in promotional       features on the artist website, and advising on the script for a Channel 4       documentary (When Bj&#246;rk Met Attenborough, Pulse films, 2013).
Dibben's research has therefore influenced the understanding of Bj&#246;rk's       music, and of how music might `be about' human relationships with nature       and technology, either directly through her own writings, interviews, and       editing choices, or indirectly, through other intermediaries.
At a more individual level, Dibben's research informed the pop-up music       school curriculum which runs alongside the Biophilia world tour.
She briefed and taught on the first of these (Manchester International       Festival, 2011), advised on later incarnations (e.g.
Reykjavik, 2011), and       her work is part of the online educational materials at       http://biophiliaeducational.org/.
For example, the one-week Biophilia       music school in Manchester comprised science and music classes for 25       school children from under-privileged homes and some of their teachers: "I         have personally become interested in how apps and music programmes can         be used to inspire music making rather than be just a tool to record         compositions."
(Teacher, Manchester); "It's taught me that any         sound can make music, and how much science and music is related"       (Student, Manchester); "The educational part of Biophilia is a         spectacular and groundbreaking project.
Inspiring teachers to work in an         interdisciplinary manner with mixed age groups and using creativity as a         learning tool works remarkably well.
This kind of fusion in teaching can         play a part in shaping curriculums in the future."
(Teacher,       Reykjavik).

3.
Economic impact.
Dibben's research had three types of economic impact: i) the small but       direct economic impact of the original publication &#8212; Bj&#246;rk       (Equinox, 2009); ii) added value to Bj&#246;rk's Biophilia artefacts       (2011), and iii) added value to the Biophilia touring show       (2011-13).
i) There is a small direct economic benefit of the monograph (c.2700       copies sold @ &#163;11.99) to the British publishing industry.
ii) The other types of economic impact are potentially larger but are       harder to separate from the significant economic impact made by Bj&#246;rk's Biophilia       project as a whole (e.g.
the iPad app alone was the top selling music app       in 41 countries).
The presence of Dibben's research added creative and       economic value to four artefacts (Bj&#246;rk: Biophilia app album, 2011;       Biophilia Ultimate Edition, 2011; Biophilia Manual, 2011;       and Biophilia Live programme, 2011) and this benefitted       the record companies One Little Indian, Wellhart and Nonesuch.
In evidence       of this, products including Dibben's work were sold at a higher price       point than those without: the Biophilia Manual Edition retails at       &#163;35, and Ultimate Edition was &#163;500 (both containing Dibben's       essays), whereas the Biophilia CD in jewel case (without Dibben's       essays) retails at &#163;9.99.     iii) Dibben was commissioned to write exhibition material displayed in       the show's performance venues (e.g.
Manchester International Festival       2011, Reykjavik Harpa Concert Hall 2011, New York Hall of Science 2012,       Alexandra Palace, 2013), enhancing the events by creating a clearer       understanding/augmented experience, and therefore adding value.
