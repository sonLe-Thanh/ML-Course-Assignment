     The research outlined has had specific impact on the curriculum of       schools as well as policy and practices within the UK and in Victoria,       Australia.
The research on alternative pedagogies as children move from       Foundation to Stage 1, and in particular, the finding that outdoor       learning opportunities can positively impact on learning outcomes, was       used to frame an entire school development plan.
The first school involved in the research, Leigham Primary, put resources       into ensuring that this was at the heart of their educational offer.
Identifying CPD needs, staff went on an allotment training day to       overcome, for example some reluctance to engage with outdoor activity.
They have moved their Foundation stage classrooms to have access to the       outdoors, allow children to independently choose whether to play outside       or not, and use the local woods more.
"The study provided practitioners with the opportunity to reflect on         their practice and consider the importance of the learning that takes         place outside the classroom.
I feel that since the study I have seen         more evidence of 'outdoor learning' taking place across Foundation Stage         2 and Key Stage 1."

The other school involved in the research approached school development       through the lens of creativity and extended their school grounds with more       structured learning prompts such as an earth mound dragon to stimulate       storytelling, class-designed seating areas, chickens, and a poly tunnel       for growing crops and for outdoor science.
They also invested in literacy       belts, a children's toolbelt with pencils and a notebook, to wear in       outdoor spaces.
As stated by the Head of Little Stoke School "As a         school we recognise it makes a huge difference.
The children are so much         more engaged and excited about what they are doing."
Based on her research findings, Waite was asked to be the external       commentator on the outdoor education middle school curriculum in Victoria,       Australia and had a direct impact on curriculum policy and practice.
She       was also invited to present key messages from the research to teachers in       Singapore engaged in delivering a new curriculum offer, `The Programme for       Active Learning'.
As stated by the Outdoor Education Curriculum Developer       in Victoria "Sue Waite's research has been influential in shaping both         policy and practice.
Her input to this process helped shape the review         of the curriculum in terms of both policy and content".
Waite established the Outdoor and Experiential Learning Research Network       as a result of the research.
This provides a forum for discussing and       sharing research and is used widely by practitioners.
This network led to       the partnership between Plymouth University and The Silvanus Trust and the       development of a successful Lottery bid for almost half a million pounds       for the Good from Woods project.
The project, which started in       2010, is based upon the previous research undertaken by Waite and runs       until 2014.
This research is impacting upon practitioner skills and approaches.
Forest School practitioners use the research to understand the pedagogical       principles underpinning their work.
Practitioners were trained to research       their own practice and then cascade the skills and learning to other       practitioners, resulting in early impact on organisations.
Waite mentors       the practitioner-researchers.
The Silvanus Trust reported an increased       understanding of ethics and research approaches.
The organisation also       feels more confident and has been able to develop by bidding for funding       that they wouldn't have previously gone for without the `Good for         Woods' research.
Recent successes for the Silvanus Trust includes       being awarded a national evaluation from Defra for the Big Tree Plant and       a Heritage Lottery grant for research into woodland cultures.
Both of       these successes have been attributed to the impact of the Good from Woods       research as stated below:     "The experience gained from working with Plymouth University has         increased our confidence and added to our track record, helping us to         successfully bid for work we might not otherwise have bid for...Our         partnership with Plymouth University on the Good from Woods Lottery         funded research project has definitely brought us up to speed on         research ethics.... We are actively incorporating this best practice         into the Trusts other activities."
The Steering Group for Good from Woods includes representation from the       Woodland Trust, which has resulted in national influence on policy on how       to support well-being in and for woodland.
As described by the Woodland       Trust... `I've enjoyed reading the GFW report; there are some         absolutely fascinating findings which I think will greatly benefit us at         the Trust and will make a real difference to how we manage our events         and materials for schools in the future.'
