     Rolls-Royce identified a need to develop a world class manufacturing       solution for its aero-engine casing components and consequently, initiated       a project at the AMRC within the remit of the Environmentally Friendly       Engine (EFE) programme [S1].
This &#163;95M initiative included research into       `Novel high temperature materials and associated manufacturing processes'       [S2], which provided a suitable platform to develop the Technology       Readiness Level of the underpinning research.
The AMRC's role was to deliver [text removed for publication]       prototype engine casings to Rolls- Royce, and to quantify the cost savings       that could be achieved by developing and integrating the underpinning       research topics [S1]:            [text removed for publication]       [text removed for publication]       [text removed for publication]          [text removed for publication]     Based upon this result, Rolls-Royce worked with the AMRC to implement the       novel machining approaches across a wide range of their commercial product       range.
This has led to economic impact:     &#163; [text removed for publication] saved by adopting new         processes (economic impact)     "[text removed for publication].
The AMRC staff demonstrated how their         novel machining approaches could be applied to this component.
Subsequently, [text removed for publication] has implemented the AMRC's         manufacturing methodology and has achieved an estimated cost saving of         [text removed for publication] across all the components manufactured         between 2008 and July 2013."

Adoption of new processes (economic impact)     "In June 2010, the AMRC worked with our casings manufacturing facility at       [text removed for publication], to implement their novel approach on the       [text removed for publication] casing.
A [text removed for publication]       reduction in the component cycle time was achieved."

Adoption of new processes (economic impact)     "From November 2010, the AMRC worked with our casings manufacturing         team to design the machining process for an engine casing for the [text       removed for publication].
This has demonstrated a cycle time reduction       of [text removed for publication] and cost savings of [text       removed for publication] per component.

In addition to this direct impact on Rolls-Royce business, the       underpinning research has had the following broader impact:     Impact on best practice: Sandvik published new technical guidelines         for their customers     The underpinning research work undertaken into machining of heat resistant       superalloys was extended to conventional carbide tooling undertaken in       conjunction with Sandvik Coromant.
The results of this activity have been       translated into Sandvik Best Practice Guide for machining of casings made       from heat resistant superalloys [S3].
This guide is downloadable from the       Sandvik website, and also provides the foundation of the training provided       to their global application engineering team in this area.
Impact on society: MANTRA     The AMRC was awarded the EPSRC's 2007 Knowledge Transfer Challenge [S4]       (&#163;500k), which funded the MANufacturing Technology Transporter (MANTRA).
During the period 2008 to July 2013, MANTRA has hosted nearly 18,000       visitors from the general public, and has visited over 100 schools and       colleges.
MANTRA visited the palace of Westminster on two occasions to       promote the impact of industrial research on the UK High Value       Manufacturing sector [S5].
The underpinning research from this case study       has been used in the MANTRA project, as reported by the EPSRC:     "... highlights of advanced research which are in clear demand from         industry are among its [MANTRA's] features.
A way of machining more         efficiently resulting from university work with Rolls-Royce allows         material to be removed from the casings nearly 20 times faster than         usual..." [S6].
Impact on the environment: Environmentally Friendly Engines     The operational practice of Rolls-Royce has been changed to help achieve       environmental objectives.
This is evidenced by the AMRC's role in the       environmentally friendly engine (EFE) programme: a technology demonstrator       project to help Rolls-Royce to meet stricter environmental standards set       by the Advisory Council for Aeronautics Research in Europe (ACARE 2020)       [S2].
These standards include a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions, and an 80%       cut in NOx emissions.
Four prototype engine casings were delivered to       Rolls-Royce as part of the EFE programme [S1].
