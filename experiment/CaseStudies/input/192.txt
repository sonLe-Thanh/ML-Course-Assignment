     [text removed for publication], a manufacturer of innovative medical       products, have produced a new product ([text removed for publication]) to       support data annotation (labelling of user activities based on playback of       video) within smart environments based on research undertaken by CSRI.
The       [text removed for publication] product has the ability to record user       interactions with objects (e.g.
turning on a tap, lifting a cup, opening a       door) within a smart environment through a set of stereo-based video       cameras and to synchronise recordings with data generated by other sensors       (e.g.
notifications via contact or motion sensors of: a door opening, a       person moving, a household object being lifted).
Pre-configured activity       labels appropriate to the environmental context are used to manually       annotate user activities (e.g.
preparing a meal, using the telephone,       making a drink).
In 2009 CSRI entered into collaboration with [text removed for       publication].
By using stereo-based cameras with millimetre accuracy, the       [text removed for publication] Platform marketed by [text removed for       publication] at that time had the ability to track the movement of       surgical equipment, in relation to a reference point, during surgery.
During 2009-2012, research results from CSRI's evaluations of homeML       established the need for large validated and annotated datasets sharing a       common format to be collected within smart environments to support the       development of activity recognition algorithms.
This, together with [text       removed for publication] expertise in precision measurement and tracking,       was the motivation for developing the [text removed for publication]       product.
[text removed for publication] have recognised the guidance       provided by CSRI in the product development of [text removed for       publication] [E1], which is designed for use by research organisations to       produce validated and annotated datasets that can be shared in a common       format.
[text removed for publication] is a unique product and the first of       its kind.
Via stereo-based cameras and wireless sensor networks, the [text       removed for publication] product can record and synchronise multi-channel       data about user activities within a smart environment (e.g.
opening a       door, lifting a cup, turning on a tap).
Following completion of a set of       activities, recorded video may be replayed and the users' actions       annotated (labelled), subsequently automatically annotating all other       sensor-based data that have been simultaneously recorded.
The [text       removed for publication] product incorporates CSRI's research results on       the development of a common format for smart environment data by storing       its data using the homeML format [2].
Through development of the new product, [text removed for publication],       that incorporates CSRI's research on data storage and common format for       smart environments, [text removed for publication] have experienced a       positive economic benefit.
Since 2010 the economic impact of [text removed       for publication] for the company has been:            [text removed for publication] additional staff have been employed by         [text removed for publication] as research and development engineers to         progress and support development of the [text removed for publication]         product [E1];       [text removed for publication] have secured [text removed for         publication] contracts to use [text removed for publication], yielding         additional new revenue of [text removed for publication] [E1];       The [text removed for publication] product is currently being used by         [text removed for publication] users [E1].
The results from CSRI's research on activity recognition [3, 4, 5, 6]       have been exploited further by [text removed for publication] through       establishment of a Research Agreement with CSRI to extend the       functionality of the [text removed for publication] product by       incorporating automated activity recognition modules [E2].
A communication       architecture has been defined at a software level to be used by [text       removed for publication] and CSRI to support the software integration of       activity recognition modules within [text removed for publication].
The       purpose of including activity recognition modules is to facilitate the       automatic annotation of activities and thus reduce the amount of manual       annotation required when using the [text removed for publication] system,       significantly reducing the time required to generate a fully annotated       dataset.
An additional impact of this research has been in public sector service       enhancement.
During 2012 Belfast City Council made a successful funding       bid to the NI Department of Culture Media and Sport's &#163;100M Urban       Broadband Fund to position Belfast as a "super-connected city".
As part of       the bid CSRI provided supporting rationale to Belfast City Council's       application in the form of Connected Health Case Studies that would       benefit the community if a super-connected city were to be established.
One of our Case Studies demonstrated the significance of high-speed       network access for remote monitoring of smart environments and automated       recognition of activities taking place in those environments.
Belfast City       Council was awarded &#163;13.7M, with full recognition of the support provided       by CSRI being acknowledged in this process [E3].
The award is enabling       Belfast to become a world-class digital city, providing consumers with       faster access to wireless broadband services throughout the city and       growth potential for local industry.
Whilst the research on developing approaches for storage and exchange of       data within smart environments [2] is associated in part with a       long-standing research collaboration since 2007 with Josef Hallberg and       Kare Synnes, Lulea Technical University, Sweden, it is the contribution of       CSRI to that research and CSRI's research results on automated activity       recognition that are incorporated into the [text removed for publication]       product.
