     The principle impacts are those upon public policy and the environment       through scientific work to support international/national policy and       regulation.
These have resulted in real-world impacts, which ultimately       result in tangible reductions in global CO2 and other       atmospheric emissions.
Research on International Aviation Emissions: CATE, at MMU, has       been working within a technical body of the UN ICAO Agency, to design the       first CO2 emissions standard for aircraft (see `Research on       international aviation emissions', sec.2).
MMU input has been crucial for       the relevant UK and European regulatory authorities ([D], sec.5).
The ICAO formally adopted the metric in February 2013 ([B], sec.5),       but the standard has not yet been set.
MMU is active in both establishing       the principles for standard-setting and quantifying the impact of       standards on future CO2 emission reduction.
CATE leads one of       the 6 technical ICAO Working Groups (Impacts and Science Group) and       supports 3 others.
According to the Executive Director of the Federal       Aviation Administration of the US: "CATE's efforts to quantify         aviation's emissions inventories have informed critical decisions on new         air quality and noise engine and aircraft standards in 2010 and 2013 at         ICAO/CAEP.
Such policy decisions have tremendous costs and offer         substantial environmental benefits.
They must be made carefully and be         informed by the best available science.
CATE has been at the forefront         of informing policy makers and ensuring their decisions are         science-based" ([D], sec.5).
Research on International Maritime Emissions: The IMO is the UN       Agency responsible for international emissions of CO2 from the       maritime sector, under Article 2.2. of the Kyoto Protocol.
The IMO       commissioned a `game changing' emissions and impacts assessment, published       in 2009, to which David Lee contributed.
This report has made a major       impact on the maritime sector and has set benchmarks for historical,       present, and future potential emissions through the development of       scenarios.
"The involvement of Professor Lee, amongst other         world-leading experts has reduced the uncertainty for governments in         their decision making process and is one of the main reasons for IMO's         successful adoption of the first binding and global CO2         regime for an industry sector."
(Technical Director, IMO, [E],       sec.5) In addition to the emissions assessment, the section on the climate       impact of maritime emissions was co-led by David Lee.
Through the IMO       report ([3], sec.3) and follow-on publications ([2], [6],       sec.3), this shifted the perspective of the maritime and shipping industry       to accept that the sector's emissions of CO2 lead to global       warming in the long-term, despite short-term cooling from sulphur       emissions.
Thus SO2 emissions regulations proceeded (entered       into force 1 July 2010), with the consequential protection of local and       regional air quality, simultaneously combined with a separate focus on CO2       emissions reductions.
This resulted in adoption of a CO2       emissions standard/energy efficiency design index in July 2011.
Designing aviation policy options in the European Union and the UK:       In January 2012, the European Union introduced aviation into its Emissions       Trading Scheme (ETS).
The original scope of the scheme, in terms of       pollutants and policy/geographical scope, was commissioned by the European       Commission in 2005 ([5], sec.3).
The 2005 report set out the basic       design of the ETS.
Crucially, the European Parliament wanted to include       non-CO2 emissions from aviation, and David Lee, concluded in       this ([5], sec.3) and a later (2008) report to the Commission that       they should not be included in the ETS as the science was not sufficiently       developed.
As a result of the EU-ETS, significant CO2 emissions       savings will result (currently under some negotiation at the international       level, to which MMU is contributing data).
"From the early stages of         policy formulation through to on-going international negotiations over         the future global policy and rules on aviation emissions, timely MMU         research and input have enabled EU policies and positions to be         formulated and defended on the basis of solid and state-of-the art         knowledge, the most prominent example hereof being aviation's inclusion         in the EU's Emissions Trading System" (Personal assistant to         Member of Cabinet of Connie Hedegaard, European Commissioner for Climate         Action [F], sec.5) The UK Committee on Climate Change (CCC)       was established by Parliamentary Act to examine UK CO2       emissions each year and ensure that the UK is on course to meet targets.
The CCC assessed whether aviation emissions should form part of these       targets, and examined impacts and mitigation options.
David Lee was       appointed to the CCC as special advisor on aviation, and contributed       towards the writing of the CCC's 2009 Aviation Report, as recorded in the       report's acknowledgements.
As a result, the CCC noted that CO2       emissions from international aviation should be considered in the UK legal       targets for CO2.
Moreover, the CCC adopted and re-published the       main chart from [1], sec.3, and recommended that non-CO2       impacts should be revisited in the future "David Lee was an expert         advisor for our review of aviation emissions (CCC, 2009), where he         provided advice on non-CO2 effects, aircraft and fleet         technologies and future scenarios.
This report was, and continues to be,         very influential in debates around the future of UK aviation" (Climate         Science Advisor, Committee on Climate Change Secretariat [G],       sec.5).
Informing Climate Negotiations for Emissions Reductions Pledges:       As a result of extensive technical and scientific experience in the       aviation and shipping sectors, David Lee was invited by UNEP to lead a       chapter of a UNEP Synthesis Report ([6], sec.3) on whether pledges       of emissions reductions will be sufficient to meet the `2 degree target'       for global warming.
The UNEP report `Bridging the Emissions Gap' was       launched at the Royal Society in 2011, and presented to the Conference of       Parties to the Climate Convention at Durban in 2011.
As a result, various       `Parties to the Convention' re-pledged emissions reductions and for the       report to be taken into account in climate negotiations.
"The UNEP         series reports on the 'emissions gap' of where we need to be on a 2         degree trajectory, and where we are according to current pledges and         projections, has been of vital importance to policy makers in the UNFCCC         negotiations.
The analysis from the gap report has been extensively used         by negotiators to support their work and is often quoted during the         climate talks and negotiation sessions."

Work for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: The work       of the IPCC was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.
Four of MMU's staff       from CATE (Lee, Raper S, Raper D and Dimitriu) are Lead Authors.
Lee as       REF researcher has contributed to the 1999 Aviation Report ([I],       sec.5), the 2006 Greenhouse Guidebook ([J], sec.5) and the 2007       Fourth Assessment WG3 Report ([A], sec.5), and the writing of the       Fifth Assessment Report from 2011 to 2013.
CATE has made significant       contributions to IPCC reports that have been critical in informing       international climate policy and have enduring impact in the current REF       impact period.
The IPCC Greenhouse Guidebook (2006) for example ([J],       sec.5) is still the de facto standard for estimating and reporting       aviation and shipping emissions internationally and still in use to 2013.
