     In the UK, national contingency planning is the responsibility of the       Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS) within the Cabinet Office.
Their       website states "....we need to be ready and able to deal with potential         emergencies and disruptive events; these can range from natural         disasters like flooding or heavy snow to deliberate acts or attacks....".A        As described in detail below, our input into the CCS has provided       "..... a useful resource for the CCS in identifying key issues and         gaps which exist within the NRG [National Recovery Guidance] and         also suggests how the CCS might go about filling these gaps.
"B       This documented change in policy implementation by government in the UK       (the NRG) has been followed by similar uptake of our insights in       Australia.C     Our research, (described in Section 2) provided high quality evidence on       recovery and resilience, building on the specific case study of the Hull       floods of 2007.
Our research emphasised (i) that many people experienced       the flood recovery process as more traumatic than the flood event itself       and (ii) that the impact of flood recovery on children and young people       was unrecognised in policy.
After our research in Hull, Dr Hugh Deeming       plus Medd and Whittle, undertook specific follow-on work to build on the       impact of these projects, funded by an EPSRC Pathways Impact Award       (December 2010 &#8212; March 2011) and the Cabinet Office (December 2010 - March       2011).
This involved:     1) Developing an online version of our "Flood Snakes and Ladders' flood       recovery training tool.
This was devised because research users said they       needed ways to demonstrate the complexities of the recovery process,       highlight the `recovery gap' and identify opportunities for intervention.
2) Undertaking a comprehensive review of the National Recovery Guidance       (NRG) for the Cabinet Office, identifying the key learning, gaps and       recommendations from the two Hull Flood StudiesD.
NRG's website       still includes a direct link to our project reports as part of its       guidance "... aimed at local responders and developed in line with the         Civil Contingencies Act (CCA) on recovering from an emergency in the UK."
We have continued to follow-through these research findings to deliver       significant impacts through (i) continued engagement with policy makers       and practitioners, (ii) the production of innovative training materials       which can be used by policy makers and practitioners to improve       understanding of the impacts of flood recovery and (iii) extensive media       engagement in the UK and internationally.
The resulting impacts are       detailed below.
1) Bringing recovery issues to the forefront of policy attention.
Prior to 2007, recovery issues were hardly considered in policy documents       and related support, which concentrated solely on the disaster itself and       the immediate emergency response phase which followed.
Our research thus       provided policy makers with the evidence that transformed their       understanding of recovery.
In particular, our work influenced the Pitt       Review (the government's national inquiry into the 2007 floods), where it       was used as a case study to demonstrate the impacts of flood recovery.E       This was particularly significant as, in the interim Pitt Review, health       and well-being were subsumed as one page within the "Recovery" chapterF.
In response to that interim review, we contributed specific evidence on       our insights, and the final Pitt Review incorporated a full chapter on       this topic, that highlights our work as a specific case studyE.
We also influenced post-Pitt policy development through responses to a       series of Defra consultations.
Most explicitly, in relation to       consultation on property-level flood resilience measures, we recommended       the introduction of free surveys and a locally-flexible scheme to       subsidise the implementation of these measures, and that there should be       close liaison with local communities.G All these suggestions       were incorporated by Defra as part of a new &#163;5.6 million flood protection       grant schemeH.
2) Transforming national Guidelines on Community Resilience and         Recovery.
The Cabinet Office is a major user of our research.
They       requested our specific involvement in advising policy on community       resilience.
We were invited to sit on the Community Resilience Programme       Steering Group which culminated in our research being quoted as a major       influence on policy:     "The Civil Contingencies Secretariat has participated in the steering         group for the project, attended workshops and met the diarists to         understand the experiences of those affected by major flooding.
Access         to the diarists, and hearing their experiences influenced the         consultation process and provided a constant reminder of the need to         ensure that community resilience is accessible and useful to all         community members.
It also reiterated the need to facilitate increased         risk awareness within the population to better inform their decision to         get involved in preparing for emergencies.
"G     The Civil Contingencies Secretariat also incorporated our learning in       their work through `Flood Snakes and Ladders', an interactive flood       recovery simulation tool that we developed, and which was used by the       Civil Contingencies Secretariat on their staff training.
The civil servant       who organised this said: "I think the quotes really demonstrated to         them [fellow staff] the real impact on the ground and got many of         them to be quite reflective as a result... [The game was] a         brilliant way to demonstrate how exceptionally frustrating it would be         if it happened in real life.
"i      Directly following this, we were commissioned by the Cabinet Office to       undertake a comprehensive review of the National Recovery Guidance (NRG)       to ensure that it included learning from our research.
The Cabinet       Office's recovery policy manager has stated that our review of the NRG       ".... was a useful resource for the Civil Contingencies Secretariat in         identifying key issues and gaps which exist within the NRG and also         suggests how the Civil Contingencies Secretariat might go about filling         these gaps.
The work that the [Lancaster Environment] Centre has         carried out for the Civil Contingencies Secretariat has been very useful         and the products produced... well thought through and stimulating.
"B     3) Environment Agency strategy and practice.
The EA drew directly       on our work in developing a new internal strategy document on recovery.
They wrote to us saying "the Hull work will help our communications         staff understand how people feel after a flood and ensure that any         communications from the EA (e.g.
about signing up to Floodline Warnings         Direct) is sensitive to the problems people face and hopefully more         joined up with other organisations responsible for recovery, like LAs.
This also applies very specifically to post-flood drop-ins where we         often held these separately to other organisations.
This shouldn't         happen in the future.
"J     4) Defra review of climate change preparedness and the National         Adaptation Programme.
In 2011, DEFRA commissioned Frontier Economics       Limited to review climate change adaptation, specifically in the context       of health and well-being.
The company drew extensively on our research,       citing us 26 times and stating that "[our] interview with you directly         inform[ed] the `Health and well-being theme' of the report"K,L.
This report has been highly influential, being cited by many organisations       in describing their plans for climate adaptation and being used by Defra       to inform the National Adaptation Programme.
5) Improving support for recovery in contingency planning world-wide.
While the Hull case study focussed on flooding, our insights are no less       pertinent to resilience to other disasters, natural or otherwise.
Our       research is now delivering impacts beyond the UK, not least where climatic       extremes are bringing increased need for effective contingency planning       for natural disasters.
We were invited to give two seminars at the       National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF) in Australia       in April 2011 and these seminars have had an impact on the work of local       disaster recovery agencies in Australia by providing them with further       evidence of the importance of tackling longer-term recovery issues.
For       example the Principal Recovery Adviser to the Government of Victoria       commented "....there has been a dearth of research that looks at the         'lived experience' of the recovery process.
Even with major recent         events in Victoria such as the 2009 bushfire with 179 deaths and over         2,000 houses destroyed, the 2010-11 floods with around 2,000 homes         significantly flooded and many more impacted....
I just wanted to let         you know how useful your work has been for post-disaster recovery work         that I undertake".C More recently, our research is also       being used by Save the Children Fund to help them improve their response       to emergencies.
We have worked with Save the Children UK Emergencies team       to develop the Journey of Hope (JOH) UK; a post-disaster psychosocial       recovery programme for children, young people and their carers.
As part of       this on-going work we will present progress on JOH to the Cabinet Office       Emergency Planning College Conference "Neither Seen Nor Heard".
The reach and significance of the impacts that have already been       delivered from our research has been recognised by ESRC, who in 2013       awarded us 2nd prize for Outstanding Impact in Public PolicyD.
In their commendationD ESRC state "The Hull Floods Project         team at Lancaster University has transformed policymakers' understanding         and management of the human impacts of the flood recovery process.
The         team had continued engagement with policymakers and practitioners, and         produced innovative training materials.
