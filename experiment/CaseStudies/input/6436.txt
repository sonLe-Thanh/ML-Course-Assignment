     Blain was asked to give evidence as a witness or was otherwise involved       in the process of all four       major Westminster and Holyrood parliamentary initiatives on Scottish media       matters in the period       2008-2011, having given evidence to the Scottish Broadcasting Commission       (2008), the       Westminster `Crisis in the Scottish press industry' inquiry (2009), the       Holyrood consideration of the       local/weekly press industry (2010), and having been a member of the       Scottish Digital Network       Panel (SDNP, 2010-2011), these engagements in addition to speaker and       panellist roles in related       public events including those organized by the Scottish Government.
Corroborating sources below detail the main areas of impact, which are       (a) government responses       to evidence given at the two press inquiries and to the SDNP report and       (b) the public response to       the SDNP report.
A number of conclusions impacting on future policy arose       from both press       inquiries, and indicative corroboration material is offered below of the       Westminster follow-up to the       Scottish Affairs Committee inquiry.
The Scottish Digital Network Panel report elicited both a supportive       response from Fiona Hyslop,       the government minister who commissioned it, and in subsequent debate at       the Scottish       Parliament (online link given below).
The report's main recommendations       were adopted by the       Scottish Government and widely supported in the Scottish Parliament.
Because of the imminence       of the Scottish independence referendum, the next phase of Scottish       Government action on the       Scottish broadcasting landscape is for the time being in abeyance, though       the SDNP report's       recommendations to move forward with the establishment of a digital       network remain government       policy.
The corroborating sources below are a very few examples of many which       evidence both strong       media interest and public responses eg on comment threads online,       in coverage of the SDNP's       activities and report.
This was on a substantial scale, not just by the       BBC and STV, but by a       number of newspapers and specialist publications and websites.
One of the       sources below also       refers to a major industry/political sector event in November 2010 at       which among others former       BBC Director General Greg Dyke gave his response to the ongoing work of       the Panel, with a large       invited audience including MSPs, senior broadcast and press executives and       representatives of       Ofcom and various NGOs.
Blain was also involved in subsequent discussions       about the Panel's       work, for example at an RSA Fellow's debate on the report (Anderson       Strathern LLP, Edinburgh,       10 February 2011) and in the media, for example discussing the report on       BBC Radio Scotland.
