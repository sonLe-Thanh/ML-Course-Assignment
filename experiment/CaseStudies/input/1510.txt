     The dual impacts of this work lie in public engagement in evolutionary       science and in supporting the generation of more than $10 M income for the       UK TV and film industry.
Ever since the successful employment of modern CGI (computer generated       image) techniques in animating prehistoric reptiles, first in Steven       Speilberg's portrayal of Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park       (Universal Pictures 1993), and subsequently in the novel "documentary"       genre for Tim Hains' and Jasper James' Walking With Dinosaurs (BBC       1999), public interest in prehistoric reptiles, especially dinosaurs and       pterosaurs, has soared.
Walking With Dinosuars "began a new genre       of TV programme, the animated documentary, from which there have been many       spinoffs.
The scientific input from the Portsmouth team was a key element       of that success."1.
Since 2008, our work on pterosaurs has been directly incorporated into a       BBC1 TV series and two major film productions: Planet Dinosaur       (BBC1: 2011), Flying Monsters 3D (Sky 3D: 2011) and Walking         With Dinosaurs: the 3D movie (BBC, 20th Century Fox,       National Geographic: to be released Christmas 2013).
Martill and/or Witton       were principal scientific consultants for these productions.
In all of       these productions, the pterosaurs are animated with morphology and ecology       based directly on the work of the Portsmouth Group: the scientists       constructed the physical models which were then developed in CGI.
As documented below2, Sir David Attenborough has noted the       importance of this scientific work to such programmes: regarding Flying         Monsters, he states that `Dr Martill advised us throughout the         film's production and gave it great authority'.
In a public       interview, Anthony Geffen, CEO Atlantic Productions, stated that "the CG       team worked for months with scientists"3.
Planet Dinosaur,       a six-part TV series4 incorporates the terrestrialised ecology       of azhdarchid pterosaurs as proposed in research by the Portsmouth group.
These programmes have received worldwide critical and public acclaim, as       well as major commercial success.
Planet Dinosaur received viewing       figures of more than 4 million for episode 1 and around 2.9 million for       subsequent episodes4,5.
Flying Monsters 3D won awards       from BAFTA (the first-ever Specialist Factual at the 2011 British Academy       Television Awards) and the 2011 Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival (Best       3D Film) and is believed to have been one of the most successful       documentary films ever made.
The film was first screened on Christmas day       2011 on Sky 3D and has since been screened worldwide.
Using computer animations based on our research, Flying Monsters 3D       was extremely successful ("Educational and fun" &#8212; Independent on Sunday;       "Young dinosaur addicts will love this.." The Times6,7).
By       June 2013, the film had grossed $10,252,849 at the box office and is still       showing in 84 cinemas world-wide.
Natural History museums around the world       (including the Smithsonian, the U.S. National Museum of Natural History       and the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum) have regularly screened       the film8.
DVD sales figures (release date 07/11/2011) are not       available but are expected to be high.
Walking With Dinosaurs 3D,       to be released Christmas 2013, is also expected to be a success.
In 2010 the Portsmouth team were invited to provide the "headline"       exhibit for the Royal Society's 350th Anniversary Exhibition at London's       Southbank9.
Martill and Witton's remarkable reconstructions of       azhdarchid pterosaurs were suspended around the exhibition hall, providing       a dramatic focus for the events' 70,000 visitors10 and for       media coverage (Radio 4's Today programme covered the opening by       focussing on the "flying dinosaurs").
Whilst the $10M+ income generated by these documentaries for the UK TV       and film industry is highly significant, perhaps their greatest impact       lies in bringing cutting-edge evolutionary science direct to the World's       film and TV screens.
Not only does this engage and inspire the next       generation of scientists, but it also impacts the worldwide       evolution/creationism debate and fosters a positive view of science,       particularly in young audiences.
The contribution of the Portsmouth team       was to give these programmes the firm basis in state-of-the-art       palaeontological science they needed for the success of their novel       "documentary" format.
