     Pathways: The research has informed, galvanised and shaped       European-level policy formation,       around (i) working-time and `work-life balance', and (ii)       policies to advance gender equality in       employment and the labour market.
Impacts were achieved through:             Expert appointments working with the EC, ILO and other         influential international policy bodies,         engaged in employment policy formation and evaluation.
Widely disseminated official research reports, bolstered by         high profile speaking         engagements for European policy makers, national government         representatives and others.
The coordination of an expert academic network, appointed to         advise the EC's Equal         Opportunities Unit.
Through consultancy work.
Since 1998, Fagan has completed 11         consultancies informed by         the research, with total payments to UoM &gt; &#163;80K, from the EC and its         policy institutes         (Eurofound, the European Institute for Gender Equality), the ILO, the         European Trade Union         Institute (ETUI) and the UK Trades Union Congress (TUC).
Since 2004         Fagan has been         contracted as a coordinating member for the EC's Expert Group on Gender         and Employment.
Impact 1: Informing and shaping the European policy framework for         working-time and work-life         balance, including the working-time dimension of the ILO's `Decent Work'         policy:            From 2000-date Fagan has prepared a range of international policy         reports based on her         research for the UN's International Labour Organization (2003-2012), the         OECD (2006), the EC         (2010) and Eurofound, the tripartite European Union agency that provides         policy-oriented         expertise on living and working conditions, industrial relations and         managing change in Europe         (2000-2007).
Fagan prepared three international policy-orientated research reports         (2003, 2011 &amp; 2013), for         the ILO.
As a Senior ILO Research Officer attests: "Both the           empirical results and the policy           recommendations contained in Fagan's reports have influenced the ILO's           working time, work           organization, and gender equality policy advice to governments, trade           unions and employers'           associations."
It was also noted that the research subsequently         published as [C] "contributed to           the creation of the ILO's `Five Dimensions of Decent Working Time'           policy framework, which has           provided the foundation for the ILO's policy advice and advocacy work           in the working time           domain over the last decade."
Finally, Fagan's key contribution to         the ILO's 2011 Tripartite         Meeting of Experts (TME) on Working-time Arrangements, the first         convened in two decades,         was noted.
She prepared one of three background research papers &#8212; the         others addressing         health and safety, and productivity &#8212; with "the TME             unanimously adopting a set of             conclusions, `Working Time in the Twenty-first Century', that was             endorsed by the ILO             Governing Body in March 2012 and now forms the basis of all of the             ILO's work on             working time.
These Conclusions are currently being           implemented in the `Global Product of           Working Time in the Twenty-first Century', designed to strengthen both           the ILO's research on           working time, and its policy advice and technical assistance to           constituents on developing better           working time arrangements... the positive evaluation of           Professor Fagan's TME background           report led to her invitation, under selective tender, to prepare one           of the six major outputs for the           `Global Product...' during the ILO's 2012-2013 Biennium, a research           paper on international           trends in part-time working conditions" [1].
Fagan was commissioned by the EC to prepare an `awareness-raising'           briefing [2] about the           policies and institutional factors which are conducive to increasing           men's involvement in           care work.
Previously, Fagan authored or co-authored seven         influential Eurofound reports that         analysed gender differences in working-time and working conditions,         using specially designed         surveys commissioned to stimulate policy debate and to inform         Eurofound's written and verbal         policy briefings to their European tripartite constituency [3].
Fagan's working-time and work-family reconciliation research is           also cited in support of           policy recommendations made in high-level official documents and         reports by the ILO,         Eurofound and similar organisations engaged with European employment         policy formation [4].
Fagan's profile has led to numerous follow-up invitations, to         provide advice on working-time         policy and gender equality to national/federal governments in Spain,         Austria and Finland, and         prepared briefing papers for trade union associations (ETUI, TUC) and         employers' associations         (e.g.
the European Chemical Industry).
Impact 2: Shaping the orientation of European policy design and         monitoring, in relation to         gender inequalities in employment and job quality:            Through over a decade of research and advisory work for Eurofound,         Fagan has helped to         strengthen the gender perspective in the monitoring of working           conditions, and steer and         re-invigorate debates about conceptualising and measuring job quality         dimensions.
As         Eurofound confirm: "recommendations for working-time and work-life           balance policies designed           to advance gender equality... have informed and shaped the direction           of Eurofound's reporting           and policy recommendations... and policies to advance gender equality           in employment and the           labour market... [R]esults and recommendations contained in Fagan's           reports for Eurofound           have influenced policy debate amongst governments, trade unions and           employers' associations           as well as the European institutions" [3].
As an invited expert on gender inequalities Fagan contributed to         Eurofound's academic expert           workshop which advised on: questionnaire development for the         second wave of the European           Company Survey (2007); a new approach to conceptualising and         measuring job quality (2011);         and questionnaire development for the sixth wave of the European           Working Conditions           Survey (2013).
In June 2013 Fagan accepted an invitation to join         the Eurofound Advisory         Committee on Working Conditions [3].
Via collaboration in the EC `Network of European Academic Experts           on Gender and           Employment', Fagan has helped shape the orientation of the EC's         gender equality and gender         mainstreaming approach for employment policy, collaborating in the         network (2004-), and as         the UK academic expert (2008-).
As the Head of the EC Equality Unit         notes, this contribution:         "included the design and execution of a programme of national and           international comparative           research across EU member states and EFTA countries in order to inform           the Commission's           gender quality and employment policies, and evaluations of national           policy developments and           labour market trends... [and] the analytical institutional           framework which they have applied to           the analysis of gender inequality has continued to underpin and inform           the European           Commission's gender equality and gender mainstreaming work with the           Member States in           policy developments and assessments of the subsequent stages of the           EES, including under           the present `Europe 2020' strategy" [5].
Since 2004, Fagan's research has provided the basis for over           twenty reports and briefings           on gender inequalities and policy developments in the UK, prepared         by the network for the         EC's internal use, as well as invited contributions to high level policy         workshops initiated by the         EC and European Presidency conferences.
The EC uses these documents to         monitor         developments and to inform bilateral dialogue and recommendations made         to the UK         government, through the annual round of reporting on national policy         (the National Reform         Programmes for Employment) under the `Open Method of Coordination'         (OMC).
These are, in         turn, used as a basis for the gender equality assessments included in         the employment and         social inclusion reports presented to the annual EC Presidency Summits.
Alongside EWERC colleagues, Fagan directly assisted the EC to           develop employment           policy indicators and gender mainstreaming tools which are         fundamental features of the         EC's approach to employment policy coordination.
This has included         preparing a background         report for the EC which informed the development of the official gender         equality employment         statistical indicators for monitoring European Employment Policy [6],         which remain in use to this         day.
As a member of the Bureau of European Policy Advisors (and previous         head of the EC         Equality Unit) confirms: "the coordination reports and associated           academic publications written           by Rubery, Fagan, Grimshaw developed an international comparative           analysis of gender           inequalities that attended to the varying institutional configurations           found in different national           settings, through a focus on how labour markets, welfare states and           family systems interact to           shape gender relations and inequalities" [7].
The Head of the EC         Equality Unit similarly notes         that Fagan and EWERC colleagues: "helped to broaden the European           Commission's           perspective with respect both to gender equality and to employment           policy... [and] were           centrally involved in the development of frameworks for gender           mainstreaming employment           policy and in actively monitoring its implementation through their           assessments of the member           states' National Action Plans (and subsequently the National Reform           Programmes) from a           gender perspective.
This led to the development in 2008 by the           European Commission of a           manual on gender mainstreaming based on the work of the EGGE network           and issued as a           guide for member states which is still widely used today and remains           the key gender           mainstreaming tool promoted on our web site" [5].
Notably, Fagan's         own research is referenced         in the manual [8].
Fagan's research on quotas as a tool for improving gender diversity           at corporate board           level has been used to maintain the momentum in the political debate           on this topic [A].
It         was referenced in policy documents prepared by the EC and by the Women's         Rights'         Committee of the European Parliament, and is one of ten listed resources         on the European         Parliament Libraries recommended reading list on this topic for MEPs.
In         March 2013, Fagan         was invited to present her research and policy recommendations to a         workshop organised for         the European Parliament by the Women's Rights' Committee and the Legal         Committee, as part         of the ongoing debate about the potential introduction of quota         legislation.
This was         subsequently published as a European Parliament policy briefing [9].
It         has been used by the         Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) as a key evidence base for         its policy on         quotas.
As their research and policy managers corroborate: "The EHRC           has engaged with           Fagan about her research and its policy implications [and] used           the research evidence in [A] to           inform our position on gender issues in management, including in           responding to government           consultations and dealing with internal and external inquiries on this           subject" [10].
