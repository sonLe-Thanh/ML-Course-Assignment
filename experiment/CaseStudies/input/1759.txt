     Raleigh International is a charity providing international expeditions       for young people (aged 17-24) and volunteer managers (25+) since 1984.
In       2008, the organisation approached Zhu Hua about reviewing their       educational programmes, with a view to developing a process for       accrediting learning outcomes which would recognise the unique learning       experience gained through Raleigh expeditions.
In 2009, an ERSC/TSB funded       Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) (2009-11) was set up to develop       Raleigh's pedagogical framework and an accrediting system.
The project       team was led by Professor Zhu Hua and included Professor Sue Jackson,       Raleigh International representatives, and a KTP Associate.
It reviewed       training resources and systems employed by Raleigh before developing the       project outcomes: 1) a training manual to support educational programmes       in the UK and overseas; and 2) a new qualification for Raleigh's volunteer       managers: a Post-graduate Certificate in International Field Leadership       (IFL) which is provided by Birkbeck (Sources 1 &amp; 2).
The main impacts       of this project were on the participating partner, Raleigh International,       but broader impacts included benefits to CISV (see below).
The impacts on Raleigh International extended beyond the immediate       development of the accredited training programme, enhancing its position       as an organisation with intercultural communication at its centre:            Raleigh International established a coherent pedagogical framework for         the charity's volunteer programmes, designed to suit participants'         needs.
Refocusing on quality of delivery contributed to the wider         strategic plan to focus on accreditation for older volunteers.
Following         the creation of the accreditation system there was an upsurge in         interest from prospective volunteers, wanting to enhance their         employability potential through the expedition experience.
Raleigh created a new middle management role of Education and         Development Officer to drive forward the education/accreditation and         impact research agenda, better aligning the charity with stakeholders'         interests at a national and international level.
A memorandum of agreement signed between Raleigh International and         Birkbeck established the course for the Post-graduate Certificate in         International Field Leadership in 2010.
There were ten graduates from         the programme in September 2011 (including four full-time members of         Raleigh staff) and a further 11 are currently registered.
Raleigh International set up an Educational Advisory board         representing employers, policymakers and international experts in         leadership, cultural awareness, lifelong learning, experiential         education, global citizenship, accreditation and youth education.
The         board provided strategic guidance for Raleigh, and enabled continued         support and input from academics.
The project's outcomes informed Raleigh International's new bursary         award scheme, ethical corporate engagement strategy and enabled Raleigh         International to enter a new country of operations in Africa (Tanzania),         in 2013.
Externally Raleigh International gained more visibility and support         from stakeholders in the graduate employment and schools sectors and         increased recognition of its programmes.
The collaboration contributed         to Raleigh International's success in recent years in winning funding         from the Department of International Development (DfiD) for its Global         Ambassadors' programme, and from the Department of Business, Innovation         and Skills (BIS) for the Raleigh bursary award.
Raleigh International gained a stronger international profile,         enabling it to engage in international debate and research on         Leadership, Global Citizenship and Intercultural Communication and         improve links and collaboration with local communities and new partners         overseas.
The net effect of the partnership increased levels of synergy across         the sites of delivery, far greater consistency and quality of delivery         to all participants (circa 1400 a year).
The above can be corroborated through Sources 3 and 4.
The Chief       Executive, Raleigh International writes that the project created `a       framework which allows partners to join together from different sectors       with different cultures and to work together to develop genuine benefit       for both parties.'
The impact of Zhu Hua's research on intercultural communication extends       to other organisations:            CISV, an international volunteer organisation established in over 60         countries, participated in an earlier KTP with Newcastle University         (2004-8) which Professor Zhu Hua brought to Birkbeck with her when she         started her post in Birkbeck in 2007 and also participated in the         Raleigh International project in an advisory capacity.
The Secretary         General of CISV International writes that the KTP project with CISV         enabled them to develop a new website with intercultural communication         at its heart.
Subsequently Professor Zhu Hua was invited to become a         member and deputy chair of the Education Committee of CISV.
She has         spoken at CISV's general assembly, advised them on the development of         various training programmes, evaluation procedures, and research         publications, Interspectives: A journal on Transcultural Education.
A former UK branch Chair of CISV and Education Officer of CISV is now         working on a PhD evaluating the work of the organization under Professor         Zhu Hua's supervision.
The Secretary writes, `The success of the new         site and the added interest it is generating in CISV would not have been         possible without the KTP work which helped us to crystallize and         articulate our vision and values.'
(Source 5)       To reach a wider audience and to promote dialogues between academics,         professionals, and government policy makers, Professor Zhu Hua obtained         funding to host a public seminar on the theme of `Learning by doing:         developing intercultural communicative competence' (2009).
Speakers         included the Director of Diplomas Division, UK Department of Children,         Schools and Family (DCSF) (keynote) and representatives from SIETAR UK         (UK branch of the international Society of Intercultural Education,         Training and Research) and former Global Diversity Manager for Oxfam.
About 40 intercultural consultants and researchers and representatives         from charities and NGOs took part.
The President writes: `The seminar         brought together a wide variety of speakers and delegates from the         academic community, from the commercial business world, from         governmental agencies and from not-for-profit organisations.
By         establishing that intercultural competence is best achieved through         activity, shared and negotiated in an atmosphere of openness and mutual         respect, the seminar helped to reshape pedagogical rationales underlying         many organisations active in Intercultural Education.'
