     Our research has had a direct impact on patient care, community-wide       disease prevention, the training of health professionals in disease       management, the raising of awareness of podoconiosis in scientific and       policy fora, and the mobilising of the private sector to engage in disease       prevention.
&#8226; Patients, their families and communities       Untreated, podoconiosis causes disability and disfigurement.
Patients         suffer pain and immobility, are highly stigmatised and are excluded from         social and religious gatherings and marriage.
Our research provides         evidence that enables communities to initiate simple treatment         programmes that improve physical and psychological health.
These         programmes now reach an estimated 60,000 patients in three regions of         Ethiopia [see Section 5, C1].
Our research into genetic susceptibility         has provided a robust scientific rationale to targeting shoes to         children with a family history of disease [C2].
Our behavioural research         in collaboration with the Social and Behavioral Research Branch at the         National Institutes of Health, USA, is testing community interventions         (campaign materials and household-level training sessions) to improve         the use of shoes distributed to prevent disease [C3].
&#8226; Health workers       At a workshop in June 2013, the Ministry of Health in Ethiopia agreed         to deliver training for the trainers of community health workers based         on our research outputs.
This will cover 10 disease-endemic locations in         Ethiopia and Cameroon and will reach approximately 300 trainers         altogether [C1].
Twelve Regional Heads of Special Needs Education were         trained at a workshop in Addis Ababa in June 2011.
The Ethiopian Federal         Ministry of Health has also approved an in-service training module on         podoconiosis which will be used for the refresher training of 30,000         Health Extension Workers [C1, C4].
This module was developed by         Professor Davey on the basis of research results and previous training.
&#8226; Private sector:       Contact with TOMS (a US-registered shoe company whose aim is to give a         pair of shoes to a child in need for every pair sold, www.toms.com)         developed at a time when they were looking to increase the impact of         shoes being distributed in low-resource settings.
TOMS founder, Blake         Mycoskie, and his team visited podoconiosis-endemic sites and consulted         with members of the research team to optimise the design of shoes         distributed to prevent disease [C5].
As a consequence, we have also         drawn in significant research and advocacy support from TOMS.
TOMS have         funded the preparations for a nationwide mapping of podoconiosis and         recently appointed an epidemiologist (Dr Shira Shafir) to be their         Director of Impact Assessment and ensure the shoes being distributed are         having the impact intended.
TOMS is also contributing $500,000 to the         support new Footwork posts, including an Executive Director (www.podo.org).
&#8226; Policy-makers, national and international agencies       Professor Gail Davey was a member of the Guideline Development         Committee that used research generated by this group to write the         Ethiopian National Guideline on Morbidity Management of Lymphatic         Filariasis and Podoconiosis, which is ongoing.
Our research findings         have underpinned successful advocacy to include podoconiosis among eight         priority Neglected Tropical Diseases in the Ethiopian National Plan for         Integrated Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases which was launched in         June 2013 [C6].
Professor Davey is a founding member of and now advisor         to the Ethiopian National Podoconiosis Action Network (NaPAN) [C1].
In October 2010, Professor Davey presented evidence to the Department         for Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases at the World Health         Organisation which led to podoconiosis being recognised for the first         time as a Neglected Tropical Disease [C7].
Professor Davey serves as         Director of Footwork, the International Podoconiosis Initiative         [C8].
In November 2012, Footwork initiated talks between key         stakeholders in lymphatic filariasis and podoconiosis in Atlanta, GA,         USA, paving the way for a joint mapping of both diseases in Ethiopia and         a subgroup working on improved diagnostics to enable differentiation of         these diseases in tropical settings.
This work is underway [C9].
