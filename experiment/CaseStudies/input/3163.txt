     As the priority of alcohol policy in England increasingly focused on       children and young people, the group's established profile for       high-quality alcohol research afforded opportunities to stimulate, guide       and shape debates about alcohol in local and national political agendas.
For example, the group's research on underage drinking was cited in the       initial 2008 Youth Alcohol Action Plan (corroborating reference 1), while       Bellis was an invited keynote speaker at Westminster Health Forums (2008,       2009) that served to stimulate and inform debate on alcohol between       policymakers in Parliament, Whitehall, government agencies, health bodies       and key stakeholders (corroborating reference 2).
Based on the group's research and engagement with policy discussions, in       2008 Bellis was asked to support the production of CMO guidance on alcohol       consumption by children and young people (corroborating references 3 and       4).
Underpinning research by the group showed that unsupervised and heavy       drinking were widespread in young people in England, yet there was no       guidance on alcohol consumption available for young people, their parents       or professionals.
The new CMO guidance established a national       evidence-based position on underage alcohol consumption and made the UK       one of the few countries to establish such guidance.
The group's evidence       synthesis provided the framework for the CMO's five recommendations and,       alongside the group's primary research, determined their direction.
The       following examples show how the group's research impacted on the wording       and content of the recommendations:            Recommendation 2, that if young people aged 15-17 drink alcohol, it         should be with parental guidance and in a supervised environment, was         based on the group's evidence synthesis and the group's research         findings that parental supervision of child alcohol consumption was         associated with lower levels of drinking in public places.
Recommendation 3, that 15-17 year olds that drink should do so no more         than once a week and never exceed adult daily limits, was based on the         group's evidence synthesis which highlighted the greater vulnerability         of young people to the harmful effects of alcohol, bolstered by the         group's research findings that binge drinking among young people was         associated with regretted sex and fighting.
Recommendation 4, that parents and carers should be informed of their         influence on child alcohol consumption and supported to respond to this,         was informed by the group's evidence synthesis that showed the         importance of parental influences on young people's alcohol consumption,         including the group's research linking binge drinking and parental         supply of alcohol.
The CMO for England is the most senior advisor on health issues to the       Government and the guidance was therefore influential in progressing       national and local public health policy for children and young people in       the UK (for example, corroborating reference 5).
The CMO recognised the       group's contribution in the foreword to the guidance:     "The work to support us in producing this report [CMO guidance] has         been carried out by Professor Mark Bellis and his team at the Centre for         Public Health, Liverpool John Moores University.
I am deeply grateful to         them for their excellent contribution."
Alongside guidance development, Bellis and Jones sat on the Expert Panel       (in 2008) established by the Department for Children, School and Families       to review evidence on the impact of alcohol on children and young people       and develop ideas for advice and information for parents and young people.
While the impact of the CMO guidance on reversing harmful social norms on       alcohol among young people requires longer term study, since publication       numerous interventions have been initiated to tackle underage drinking.
This includes information for parents and children on alcohol; awareness       raising campaigns; and plans to tighten legislation around licensed       outlets persistently selling alcohol to children.
A specific example of       how the guidance has been used to shape local policy is the Hampshire       County Council's policy for children and young people in foster care       (available at: http://www3.hants.gov.uk/10-4alcoholconsumption.doc).
The Department of Health also commissioned the group to undertake       research into alcohol-attributable fractions for alcohol-attributable       disease (Jones et al., 2008).
This piece of work culminated in a measure       of harm which was subsequently adopted by the Government as a national       indicator (NI39 &#8212; admissions for alcohol-attributable conditions).
Intelligence relating to children and young people, and adults and       alcohol-related harms were incorporated into the following documents: the       Cumbria Alcohol Strategy 2005-2008; Wirral Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy       2007-2010; Shropshire Alcohol Strategy 2008; and Wigan Borough Alcohol       Strategy 2009-2012.
The findings of the group's research on drinking       environments also contributed to a national debate on the association       between alcohol use, nightlife, violence and alcohol pricing (for example,       corroborating reference 6).
