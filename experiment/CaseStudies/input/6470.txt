     The methodological framework proposed in this research provided a simple       and robust estimation       process for worklife expectancy which had not previously been explored in       earlier approaches       using labour market studies.
It yielded results that are directly       applicable to the assessment of       damages in courts and which are presented in a usable form in the latest       editions of the Ogden       Tables.
The research fed directly into the 6th and 7th       Editions of the Ogden Tables, the actuarial tables       recognised by the UK courts for the calculation of compensation for the       loss of future earnings in       cases of personal injury or fatality [1], [2].
The tables are prepared for       the Government Actuary's       Department by a multi-disciplinary group of actuaries (including the       Government Actuary), lawyers,       accountants and insurers, chaired by Robin de Wilde, QC.
The impact of the       research team's work       has benefited claimants who were disabled by an injury as their       compensation was fairer and more       accurate.
Legal professionals had previously argued that the Smith v.       Manchester awards (applied       to compensate for the disadvantages faced by the plaintiffs in the labour       market following injury)       were inadequate.
The Cass research provided empirical evidence to show       that the effect of a       disability was greater than had been allowed for, especially if it       occurred as the result of an       accident rather than from birth.
The effect is also greater for people of       lower educational       attainment.
The application of the new approach therefore results in       higher awards for people in       these categories.
Robin de Wilde, QC, said: "[t]he contribution of         Professor Haberman and his         team has obviously been of importance in the preparation of the Ogden         Tables.
It is clear that the         Tables have a wide circulation amongst those who do the work, which they         affect, which is         attempting to make sense in the calculation of future financial losses.
They are accepted as being         the best that can be done for calculating such future losses" [3].
This new approach to calculating future loss of earnings when a claimant       still has earning capacity       post-injury was incorporated into the 6th Edition of the Ogden       Tables.
The following research       insights featured in these changes to the tables: (i) events other than       death during working life       must be considered; and (ii) the factors which have the most effect on the       claimants' future       employment status must be considered, i.e., whether the individual was       employed at the time of       the accident, whether the individual is disabled and the educational       attainment of the individual.
Chris Daykin, the UK Chief Government Actuary from 1989 to 2007, was       responsible for preparing       the 2nd to 6th Editions of the Ogden Tables.
He is       now an independent actuarial expert to the UK       courts for personal injury damages cases and his view of the research       impact is that:     "The `contingencies other than mortality' section of the Ogden Tables         is much used in practice both         in cases of damages for personal injury that come to Court and in many         cases which are settled         before they reach the Courts.
This section was completely revised for         the 6th edition of the Ogden         Tables on the basis of the results of ground-breaking research work from         Cass.
It was a really         significant contribution to that edition of the Ogden Tables, and the         factors and methodology         proposed immediately achieved wide recognition and application by         lawyers in settling personal         injury damages cases.".
Since the vast majority of personal injury       cases are settled outside of the       courts, the full monetary impact of the improvements in calculating future       losses cannot be       evaluated.
Nonetheless, these settlements would also normally use the       current Ogden Tables as a       starting point [4].
The case of Higgs v. Pickles was one of the first cases to be adjudicated       on the basis of the new       'Ogden 6` approach and estimates.
On 18th January 2011, Judge       Ellis in Croydon County Court       decided that the Ogden 6 deductions should be applied without adjustment       [5].
Application of the       tables without discount increased the claimant's future loss of earnings       claim substantially from       that being proposed by the defendants.
The case was the first to provide       judicial guidance on the       application of Ogden 6 without adjustment to the tables and it was of       considerable benefit to       claimants.
The approach of the court followed the intentions of the Cass       researchers in the       amendment of the Ogden tables.
These changes have enabled the courts to       estimate employment       outcomes in a dynamic framework that incorporates the effects of       disability and educational       attainment in an efficient and transparent manner.
The current edition of the Ogden Tables, `Ogden 7`, was released in       October 2011 and took into       account further issues highlighted by the researchers [2].
Key points       include: (i) the use of updated       mortality tables to incorporate increases in life expectancies for both       men and women; (ii)       corresponding increases in life multipliers for all ages; (iii)       significant increases in pension       multipliers; and (iv) changes in the definition of 'disabled`.
One recent       high-profile case that       deployed the Ogden 7 calculations was Simon v. Helmot.
Helmot sustained       very serious injuries       when struck by a car while riding a bicycle.
He was 28 years old at the       time of the accident and       was awarded &#163;9.3M by the Royal Court in 2010.
The case went through the       Court of Appeal and       ultimately to the Privy Council, which in 2012 upheld the original court's       decision to award a higher       level of compensation for loss of earnings [6].
Grahame Codd, regional Managing Partner for the legal firm Irwin Mitchell       LLP and a long-       established member of the Ogden Working Party, noted that: "The Cass         Business School team         has made a major contribution to the way in which compensation is         calculated in legal claims for         damages for people who have suffered serious injuries from accidents or         from clinical         negligence... A detailed analysis of an enormous amount of labour market         data was carried out         and presented to the Ogden Working Party.
The conclusions contained         proposals that the         multipliers for the mitigation of loss part of the equation should be         reduced and these conclusions         were accepted, and simplified tables containing reduction factors were         created.
Those tables were         incorporated into the Ogden Tables, and for the past few years these         have enabled lawyers and         insurers to make adjustments to multipliers to ensure they arrived at         more accurate figures.
The         net effect has been to increase the awards of damages for loss of         earnings for disabled people.
The team is to be commended not only for the very high quality of         their work, which has proved to         be extremely robust, but also for the very positive impact their work         has had in relation to the         outcome of compensation claims for those victims of accidents or         clinical negligence who have         suffered serious injury or disability" [7].
The Ogden Tables are also used by the UK motor insurance industry in       relation to personal injury       claims.
The Association of British Insurers estimates that about 15% of       the average UK motor       insurance premium deals with personal injury claims for under &#163;500k [8].
Thus, the revised Ogden       Tables, based on this research, also impact to a considerable degree on       the UK motor insurance       industry and policyholders.
The impact of the research is wide-ranging since the Ogden Tables are in       routine use in the civil       courts of all four constituent countries of the UK and each year thousands       of people make claims       for damages following an accident in which someone else is to blame.
While       not law, the Tables       have been recognised by the UK courts since the Civil Evidence Act of       1995.
Their use has had a       positive effect on legal practice by providing defendants, claimants,       their representatives and       judges with a solid scientific foundation for making judgements, thereby       offering a common ground       to parties in civil dispute resolution [9].
The use of the Ogden Tables       has improved the delivery of       legal services to the wider public by providing the legal professionals       who advise claimants in       compensation cases with some actuarial input from the outset without       having to pay for expensive       advice from an actuary.
This means that claimants are better informed       earlier in their case and       legal representation is less expensive because parties have an agreed       framework and a more       accurate starting point, for compensation.
This is true even if the courts       later deviate from the       starting point, subject to the particular characteristics and       circumstances of individual cases.
Finally, the direct impact of the research conducted at Cass on revisions       in the 6th and 7th Editions       of the Ogden Tables has benefited claimants who receive fairer (and in       many cases increased)       levels of financial support to meet their needs and the families and       carers of those affected by       serious injury or disability whose lives are also affected by the outcome.
