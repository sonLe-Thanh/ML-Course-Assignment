     The research demonstrates two types of commercial impact of DS:       (i) the general impact of improvements in the customer experience; and       (ii) the specific impact of growth in sales and ad revenues.
Virtually       every shopping mall now employs DS for these twin objectives.
The research is acknowledged by current industry experts such as the       directors of Intelligent Screen Media and ROI Team as having been highly       significant and influential.
As a direct result, all (or nearly all) of       the shopping centres owned by the Mall Corporation (the UK's largest       community shopping mall group in the UK) are now fitted with DS.
As a       direct or indirect result, most shopping centres now use DS, improving       information provision and enjoyment for shoppers  &#8212;  indicative of the wide       reach of the research.
Results were presented in the summer 2004 to Avanti Screenmedia, a major       international communications company, and have thus contributed to the       growth of DS.
Avanti Screenmedia were at the time one of the biggest       players in DS communications and, following my presentation and a trial       installation at the Mall Ashley, Epsom, installed DS systems across nearly       all shopping malls of the Mall Corporation.
The research findings contributed to Harrods' business decision to       upgrade replace and install newer screens in the store.
Of particular       importance was that the DS content enhanced customer experience and       influenced their purchasing behaviour, so that Harrods increased o       increase the size and number of screens from approximately 100 to       approximately 200.
This success has also led brands and advertisers to buy       more `slots' on the content schedule.
This benefit has been confirmed by       Harrod's Media Sales Director:     "The most important factor was the validation from the research that         customers noticed the screen content which enhanced their experience         plus the screen has an influence upon their purchasing behaviour.
This         has been invaluable in talking to our brands and advertisers who invest         media budgets in buying slots on the content schedule.
Since the study         not only has Harrods increased the size and volume of screens, but         investment by brands advertising upon the screen networks has also         increased"     The research led to the design of entertaining or affective ads for DS,       having two beneficial effects for the advertiser and the retailer:             the study demonstrated that consumers reacted differently to         different style of content, i.e.
the cues contained in the broadcast         messages evoke specific experiences in customers that, in turn,         positively affect the attitude towards the advertiser and consumers'         approach behaviour.
This is especially true if the messages contain         affective or a mix of affective and intellectual cues.
For example, as a         result of the Harrods trial, which included promotional material that         advertised travel, sales of the travel agent went up by 10 percent.
The         findings have helped Harrods to guide and advise their DS advertisers as         to the most effective content creation and messaging.
the `umbrella effect', that is, DS enhances the shopping experience,         which, in turn, results in an increase in intended spending.
At the         `before and after' trial at the Uxbridge mall, footfall in the mall         increased by six percent (Dennis et al, 2012).
In the Harrods         trial, shoppers who had viewed the affective or mix of affective and         intellectual cues (rather than the only intellectual cues) expected to         spend one third more and purchase one third more items in the store (Dennis           et al, 2013).
If consumers desire to make an experience last         longer, that desire affects the length of stay in the shop, purchase         intentions and satisfaction.
Moreover, the particular attractiveness of         DS ads to shoppers on their first visit to the store has important         implications for store loyalty by generating repeat business.
In sum, as a direct and indirect result of the seminal research       undertaken at Brunel, this rapidly evolving market reached a tipping point       whereby it was taken seriously by all stakeholders: retailers, mall       owners, media agencies and finally shoppers.
