     The Liverpool Model programme of action research developed during Impacts       08, was intended to feed directly into cultural policy work for all       Liverpool and national partners and the EU.
Impact of the core research themes     The three key elements of the research that have influenced stakeholders       are:     i) Advancement of the stakeholder discourse of what is meant by         `impact' and how impact can be evidenced.
The development of an       evidence based approach to cultural impact shaped guidelines for special       event applications and subsequent monitoring.
The European Commission (2010) used Impacts 08 to shape their improved         approach to evaluating           the European Capital of Culture (ECoC) programme (p9).
The UK Government made use of the work to support its tourism           policy framework (DCMS 2011 p12-13) and frame the UK City of         Culture bidding guidelines (DCMS 2010-11, see Broader impacts section).
The research was used to inform and strengthen practitioner claims         around the value of the arts, and to shape their approach to lobbying         for support.
For example Liverpool Arts Regeneration Consortium used         this as part of presentations           to the House of Commons 30 Apr 2011.
The programme was also         mentioned at the House of Lords (Lords debate: role of culture in the         UK, 17 Mar 2010) and to inform the Hansard           Debates at the House of Commons         (3 June 2010); The London 2012 Creative Programmers network (2008-2012)         also justified the value of their activity through reference to Impacts         08 (see broader impacts section).
ii) Utilisation of specific or combined methodologies.
This has       influenced the UK's and the EU's approach to evaluating major cultural       programmes.
Key examples being: LOCOG, DCMS, ACE: Cultural Olympiad       evaluation framework and implementation (2011-13, see below); DCMS: London       2012 Meta-Evaluation (2010-13); English Heritage: value of the Liverpool       World Heritage site (2012-13); DCMS: UK City of Culture evaluation       framework (2010-11); European Parliament framework for overall ECoC       programme assessment (2012-13).
iii) Use of the Impacts 08 thematic framework to shape policy as well         as to set up new organisations.
This has included the development of       Liverpool First's "Liverpool Cultural Strategy" (2008-2013) and the joint       development by University of Liverpool and Liverpool John Moores       University of a cultural policy and knowledge exchange research centre -       the Institute of Cultural Capital.
Broader impact on policy and practice       The broader impact of the research fits into four areas:       1] Cultural: informed the political debate around the value of culture and       events;       2] Economic: encouraged a change in approach to resource management in       major events (ECoC and the UK City of Culture bidding processes);       3] Practitioners: Influenced professional standards and guidelines on       cultural impact and encouraged the use of research findings by       professional bodies;       4] Policy: Stimulated and informed policy debate around the value of major       events.
The evidence for these impacts can be noted in policy       documentation and actions by a variety of stakeholders:     In Liverpool            Impacts 08 provided the evidence base that allowed Liverpool City         Council to make the political decision to protect and prioritise         continued and major investment in cultural activity throughout the         period of austerity from 2010 to the 2013.
This included continued         investment in the Culture Liverpool team, the           Liverpool Plan (events and marketing strategy) and continued grant         support to the city's cultural institutions (ACIP         &amp; CLIP).
LARC           built on Impacts 08 to articulate their `Civic Leadership Role' as         well as prove the economic impact of their activities in Liverpool and         beyond.
Liverpool First: The           Liverpool Cultural Strategy selected its main themes on the basis         of the Impacts 08 thematic framework.
In the UK            DCMS: Reference to Impacts 08 within policy documents and research         framework documents to inform assessment of cultural policy impacts         (specific examples below)        DCMS/Olympic           2012 evaluation framework: The Impacts 08 programme influenced the         approach to defining the London 2012 Olympic meta-evaluation, which         includes an appendix dedicated to Impacts 08.
Dr Beatriz Garcia was         asked to act as advisor towards this meta-evaluation programme as well         as being invited to DCMS Olympic Board meetings.
(E.g.
Report           2 includes 35 citations to Impacts 08)       The evidence base from Impacts 08 underpinned the DCMS UK City of         Culture initiative and the Liverpool Model is referred to as an exemplar         for research and evaluation.
For example: DCMS: Supporting           Vibrant and Sustainable Arts and Culture Policy and UK           City of Culture blog.
London 2012 Creative Programmers Network: This group built on the         Impacts 08 evidence base and Dr Garcia's expertise in the Olympic         cultural programme to enhance the profile and better document the         benefits of hosting a Cultural Olympiad.
This informed the 2011         commissioning of a national Cultural Olympiad evaluation programme by         LOCOG, for example the North           West Evaluation Framework refers to Impacts 08 over 12 pages.
Arts Council England, London Organising Committee Games: Impacts 08         informed the 2011 commissioning of a national           Cultural Olympiad evaluation programme p9.
In the EU and Europe            A key recommendation from the report and presentation from the International Cultural Policy           Network (recommendation 2, page 10 in ECoC           Policy Group Framework), was to include explicit requirement to         undertake comprehensive evaluation using Impacts 08 as an exemplar for         the European Capital of Culture programme (see: European Commission         (2011) Guide           for cities applying for the title of European Capital of Culture         p18).
This was presented           in Brussels in July 2010.
More than 15 ECoC candidate cities have referred to Impacts 08 as         their key evaluation referent.
Specific examples include the application         documents of cities including: Marseille- Provence 2013 (p. 189); Cordoba           2016 (p.44, p. 61); and Brabant 2018 (pp.36-37).
